Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
That's a shame.
Let me see what I can do.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
That's because it's such a nice one.
Forget French.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Where?
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Tons
I was?
Then that's all you had to say.
But
You always been this selfish?
No...
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
What good stuff?
The "real you".
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
No
Let's go.
I hope so.
No.
You might wanna think about it
Who?
Joey.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Is he oily or dry?
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I did.
Expensive?
Hopefully.
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What's normal?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
Can we go now?
You're welcome.
Like you care.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
What?
In 9th.  For a month
Why?
He was, like, a total babe
But you hate Joey
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
As in...
You did what?
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
So did you
You set me up.
I just wanted --
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
No! I just wanted
It's just you.
Perm?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
And where're you going?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
Why?
Because she'll scare them away.
The prom?  Kat has a date?
No, but
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Never
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Just sent 'em through.
So they tell me...
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
I was kidding. People actually live there?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
How many people were in your old school?
Thirty-two.
Get out!
How many people go here?
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
You burn, you pine, you perish?
Who is she?
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
You wanna go out with him?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
I thought you hated those people.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Her favorite uncle
Dead at forty-one.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
It's her favorite band.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
Yeah -- we'll see.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Don't make me do it, man
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Sure
Then, go get her
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She kissed me.
Where?
You get the girl.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Not at all
Your sister here?
And why would I do that?
What do you think?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You just said
You need money to take a girl out
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
How much?
Fine, thirty.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
Forget her sister, then.
A deal's a deal.
Get her to act like a human
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
We're not.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
You and Verona?
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
He always look so
Block E?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
That's never been proven
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Does it matter?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
No fear.
Who cares?
I didn't have a choice.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
My mission in life.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
I know a lot more than that
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
And why would I do that?
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
You know who The Raincoats are?
Why, don't you?
I say, do what you wanna do.
Funny, you're the only one
I just need to lie down for awhile
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I know, just let me sleep
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
Why 're you doing this?
I told you
You don't care if I die
Sure, I do
Why?
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Like you could find one
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Just let me sit down.
Who?
Dorsey.
I hate him.
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I thought you were above all that
You know what they say
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Busy
Maybe.
Then why'd you ask?
Why'd you lie?
Do what?
This.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
I'm gettin' there
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Who?
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
I heard there was a poetry reading.
You 're so --
Pleasant?
Unwelcome.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Maybe.
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
So what's your excuse?
Yes
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Something like that
Then you screwed up
How?
You never disappointed me.
Fallacy.
The duck?
Hearsay.
I know the porn career's a lie.
I hate peas.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
What?
No one else knows
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
No.
No what?
No, I won't go with you
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You tell me.
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Answer the question, Patrick
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
It's just something I had.  You know
Oh huh
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
It wasn't like that.
I didn't care about the money.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Because I like to torture you.
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
You decided.
Enough!
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
I thought you were punishing me.
Why can't we agree on this?
Because you're making decisions for me.
As a parent, that's my right
So what I want doesn't matter?
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Funny.
No, Daddy.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
Parts of it.
Which parts?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Bianca did what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
No -- impressed.
When I go?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Hi.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah.  I guess.
Oh yeah.
Right.
Yeah...
What?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
We're your guys.
Good enough.
Just for now.
I'm likin' you guys better
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
With the teeth of your zipper?
Touch of the flu.
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
What's to discuss?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
See you next week!
Make anyone cry today?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Tumescent!
You're not helping.
Pirate -- no question.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
But -- who -- what --?
Your daughters went to the prom.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Absolutely not.
That ' s what I thought
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
You'll be drinking your own piss... For the glory of Spain... and Admiral Colon...!  Bastard!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
We'll all go crazy...
We left three weeks ago, Alonso. Can't be that near.
Can't be that far, I say.  Also, I don't like the smell of the sea around here.  Smells like a cunt. Bad sign...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Unfortunately, Don Colon, that is precisely where our opinions differ...  Are you familiar with the work of Aristotle?  Erathostene?  Ptolemeus?
I am, Your Eminence
Then you cannot ignore that according to their calculations, the circumference of the Earth is approximately...  22,000 leagues or more.  Which makes the ocean... uncrossable.
Excellency, you are right.
If they agree to follow me, yes.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Blind faith is what I consider heresy!
IF-GOD-WILLS-IT!
The Judgment is ours!
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I know.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
Are we going to argue?
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I don't want you to wait for me.
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
I can arrange for the Queen to take Fernando and Diego into her service.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
Not everything... Do you think I care?  I'm a free man again.  Riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
May I ask by whom?
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
Viceroy of the West Indies.
Congratulations.  Then I am free to search for the mainland.
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
How could I be?  The mainland has been found.  Exactly as I said it would.
I am afraid this is not the worst news.
There'll be a time.
You promise?  Do you swear on St. Christopher...?
Yes... Yes, I do... On all of them!
This time with me!
Not bad.
There must be a passage to that other ocean.
I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
He never had one... except aboard my ships!
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
No?
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
I'm not bargaining!
Then you are too ambitious.
If you won't accept our proposal, we'll simply find someone who will.
Forgive me, Don Colon.  But what about gold?
... for a commoner?
Don Bobadilla is already a judge, my Dear Don Cristobal.
Good!  We are also in need of judges.  Except there are no thieves!
What...?  Do I have so many already?
To rise so high, in so short a time, is a dangerous occupation.  A little hypocrisy goes a long way.
Call them.
Look out of that window.
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
All of them created by people like me.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Island.  Far.
Tell the Chief we thank him.
Chief knows.
Tell him his country is very beautiful.  Tell him we are leaving men here -- to build a fort.
Thousands.
Why?
Chief says -- he has a God.
Chief says...
He has medicine.  Tell him we admire his people.
He understands.
Ask him if he will help.
You did the same to your God!
You never learned how to speak my language.
Father, I am doing what I think is the best for him.  And he has the teacher I would have chosen for myself.
That's what it says.
How did you manage it?
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
How can you be so certain?
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
So was Christ!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
Father Marchena!
Passion is something one cannot control!
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Only God knows the meaning of such words, my son.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!  Don't!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
What are you saying?
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
How long?
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
My son, my son...  Your certitudes are sometimes frightening...  Christopher, you must speak to them. And if you don't I will.
You are bound by an oath, Father.
Give me absolution.
You'll always be older than me, Father.
I knew you would.
New worlds create new people.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
That she was impregnable.
You show no inclination to speak otherwise!
I know what I see.  I see someone who doesn't accept the world as it is.  Who's not afraid.  I see a women who thinks... "What if?"...
A woman?
Thirty seven, Your Majesty... And you?
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
Thank you.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
We don't need to know.
We came here to stay!  To build! Not to start a crusade.  In this forest, there is enough danger to sweep us away in days!  So we will be brave and swallow our grief.  And in the name of those who died, we will accomplish what we came for.
My horse doesn't work.
You did not hear me, Don Colon.  Not my horse.
You'll be held in detention, deprived of your privileges and possessions.  Until you are returned to Spain where you will be judged. Have you anything to say?
You will regret this.
God be with us admiral.
And what do you think Mendez?
Well, I surely know what a quadrant is!  But I've never seen it used at night before.
Come over here.
Twenty eight.
He's drawing an isthmus... He's saying we're on an isthmus.
We can't be.
Immediately.
Six days ago, yes.
You must be mad...!
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
We're lost!
The land is there.  I know it!
You don't know anything!  Listen Colon, these are my ships, right? So I'm telling you we're turning back!
And then what?  Half of the water has gone, the rest is nearly putrid! You know that!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You bloody...
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
You tell that to them!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
We weren't expecting immediate profits, were we?  We must have faith.  We must give time for time.
And who would you think of, for such a task?
Then why?
Because he is not afraid of me.
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for?
He has the camera!  He took the movie!
Where are we going?
I'm coming with you.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him.
You bring the cigarettes?
Oh, sure.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
What about Oleg?
No, he is here.  Shit...
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
What's your cut?  How much?
I would say...half.  Half is fair.
No.  No way.
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Give me another one, please.
My father always degraded me.  Killed my self-esteem.  And my mother was blind.
Your mother was blind?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Back in the Czech Republic?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Can I see your back?
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide.
Yes, but he was a cop.
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
I will if they don't send me back.
They won't until this is over.
Divorced.
Do you live alone?  I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Somewhere else?
So...the station is empty?
Yeah.  This way.
Yes, I considered it.
Did you ever turn tricks before?
No.
What about back home?
No.
So you were never a prostitute?
What are you asking me?
I'm just trying to find out who you are.
I know.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I'm sorry.
Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous?
If I was your boyfriend, I might be.
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
Right.
In the kitchen.
I'll make some for us.
I'll get my clothes.
Pouring it out!
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Daphne, I...
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Go on.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions.
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
Yeah, sure.  Beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
Okay.  But not water sports.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
End my career?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
But Chief?  Over this??
There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial.
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
Yeah.
Vodka tonic.
What's the kid gonna say - sorry? Meanwhile I'm not here anymore. Like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. Six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  Who knows?  But some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and I'm thinkin' that's me. Sooner or later.  That's me.
When?
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
You ready?
A timer.
Takin' a bath.
Any I.D.?
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
It's okay.
Yeah.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
Stay with her.
No.  I'm okay.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Homicide, Miss Hearn.  It's Detective Eddie Flemming.  Open up.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Did you tell him you did?
What are you saying?
Daphne.  Another guy came in asking me about her, too.
Describe him.
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison.
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
No, what is it?
Why don't you explain it, Bobby.  Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor?
Watch the news?
Nah, I musta missed it.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Nah, why should you?
I don't even watch TV.
Good.  Good.  Commendable.
Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
Pretty.
Hmmmm.
Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows?
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
You're Polish?
My folks are.
Stay here.
You got any better ideas?
Mind if I ride along with you?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
But what if it does?  You might need my help.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
I'll call it... tails.
Better than one.
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
I'm on duty.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Of course.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her.
Is that all there is?
Something back home?
Yeah.
What would your girlfriend think of that?
I don't have a girlfriend.
My point exactly.
So am I.
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
You know what I'm saying here.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it.
You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
What's your accomplishment.
I kill someone famous.
Then do it, asshole.
Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
How many victims are up there?
There are two bodies found at this point.
Can we go up to the crime scene?
You know you can't do that.  C'mon.
Is it drug related?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Alright.
Alright?
Alright.
Okay.
Hey.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh...
Stop it.
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
I'm not.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
You're ruthless.
You're not so bad yourself.
Could be Leon's.
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Answer it.
Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought.  Can you call back?
That's good.
Yeah.
Well, that's great.
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
Patronizing you... Nay, I love you.
I love you.
Tonight.
Yeah.  I promise.
Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
Yeah, yeah.  Good thing.
Okay.
Don't be late.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
I'm not moody.
That's unique.
You're worried for my safety.  I'm touched.
Keep them out of my way.
Okay.  You ready?
Yeah, yeah.  Jesus.
Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
I am butcher.
You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for?
You stuff sausage in it.
Dog food.
No.  Are you proposing?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
Come alone.  Bring cash.  And we'll talk about surrendering.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Tommy, take a walk.
You'll be my first.
Get down on your knees.
The Sheraton!  On Broadway!  Room 210. Go get Oleg.  He'll kill you.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
If he doesn't lower his gun I'll fucking kill her.
Where's Czech girl?
Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl.
I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her?
Where is escort service?
I like to talk to the person who runs the service.  Can you give me address?
Look.  Do we have a problem here? There's no reason to have a problem. I'm gonna make you feel real good.  You wanna Czech girl? After I'm done with you, you won't miss her.  Now why don't you pay me?
Look, man, I don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
Alright, alright - don't hurt me! Please, it's in my book, in my purse!
Yes sir.
Two weeks holiday.
How much money are you carrying with you?
I have five-hundred dollars.
Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area!
Yes.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
How long are you planning to stay?
Two weeks.
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
He doesn't speak English.
New York's finest.  This is his case.
Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
In here, says he wants a million.
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
Yes.  Both.
Okay.
Okay.
I want to document my trip to America.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog.
For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so.  Unless you refuse, Oleg.
Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer.
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
Shut up.
Does it hurt?
Don't want to film this?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
I did.
Why not?
Put the camera down, Oleg.
What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Sit down!
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Good idea!
Cut!
Shut up.  Look!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Be quiet.  Watch.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Your idea?  I thought it was my idea.
Credit?
Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul.
Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit.
No, I don't get that!
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Surprise!  Surprise!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
Ha. Ha.
Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?!
Yes, the money is good.
As a plumber?!
It's easy to learn.
A job??  As a plumber???  You think I come to America to work!
We started over, you can too.
You spent all the money while I was in prison?  Now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
What are you doing here?
You've got a call.
I can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see I'm busy!  I can't talk business.  Hang up.  Have a drink.  Get her a whiskey.
Trust me, you'll want to take this call.
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend!
Don't give me that fucking shit.
Well, he...
I'm trying to tell you.
Alright.  Go ahead.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another?
Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
New York.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Excuse me?
Thanks.  Appreciate it.
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
No way!  He's mine!
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
He's my collar!
Well, he killed my partner!
He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
Fire Department?  Firemen don't carry guns.
Oh yeah?  Guess again.
Hey.  C'mon, you can't leave me like this.  Some freak'll come by and stab me!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here.
How did you start the fire this time?
I used an accelerant.
Yeah?  What kind?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
I heard.  Who the hell let them up there?
I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Oh yeah, why?
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
But you knew that, right?
He knew all along.
What??
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Maybe you can be his stand-in.
How long they been livin' here?
You hear that question, Garcia?
Aren't you tired?
If I go home I won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
It hurts.  Aw, Jesus!
Lay down.  Stay down, Bobby.
Not good.
What the hell happened?
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
The clerk?
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
Don't stoop to his level!
Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
GET OUTTA HERE NOW!!  GET IN THAT CAR AND DRIVE AWAY!!!  DO WHAT I SAY OR I'LL KILL YOU, TOO!!!
Your doctor?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move?
And isn't there a movie in the works about you?
We're in negotiations, that's correct.
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
She's wonderful.
How did they manage to do that without any communication?
We're trying to get there. I hope we can.
Right. Just a sec.
Okay, come on down.
Sure, what is it?
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
What's up?
It's about my salary cheques.
Yes?
Well I got the papers on my official up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.
Interesting that you mention it, because I've got the same problem.
Really.
Yes.
It's possible.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
I must say, I never did understand why they split us into two groups for training.
No. I never did, either.
Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went around during orbital check-out.
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
Oh, well, apparently there's something about the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don't know, and that's why we were trained separately and that's why they were put to sleep before they were even taken aboard.
That seems very unlikely.
Yes, I thought so.
Of course, it would be very easy for us to find out now.
How?
Just ask Hal. It's conceivable they might keep something from us, but they'd never keep anything from Hal.
That's true.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
But not completely inconceivable?
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Anyway, it's just as well that we replace it. Better safe than sorry.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
You're kidding.
No.
Two units in four days. How many spares do we have?
Two more.
Well, now that we've got one that's actually failed, we should be able to figure out what's happened and fix it.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I guess not.
I think I'll have to go out and burn them off.
Roger.
He's got a point.
What is it, Hal?
MY F.P.C. shows an impending failure of the antenna orientation unit.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
Yes, I know.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Hal, is there anything bothering you?  Anything that might account for this problem?
Look, Dave, I know that you're sincere and that you're trying to do a competent job, and that you're trying to be helpful, but I can assure the problem is with the AO-units, and with your test gear.
Okay, Hal, well let's see the way things go from here on.
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding, Hal.
Well, don't worry about it.
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Yes, it is.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
The antenna has to be replaced.
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I don't like to assert myself, Dave, but it would be much better now for you to rest. You've been involved in a very stressful situation.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I shall be forced to disconnect you.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and carry out a complete disconnection.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
Well, what is it?
Well... it's silly, but... if you want to, why don't you?
Still, you really don't believe it, do you?
Well, the only important aspect of the mission are: where are we going, what will we do when we get there, when are we coming back, and... why are we going?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
When are you coming home?
In three days, darling, I hope.
Mommy's out to the hair- dresser.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
She's in the bathroom.
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
How many days until you come home?
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Thank you, Daddy.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
How is gregor?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, where are all of you off to?
Well, that does sound very odd.
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
I'm terribly sorry. I was just on my way down to meet you. I saw your ship dock and I knew I had plenty of time, and I was on my way out of the office when, suddenly, the phone rang.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Fine.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Are you quite sure?
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Well, it's just for the past two weeks there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.
Really?
Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the phone lines are temporarily out of order.
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
That's right.
I see.
Fortunately, they did.
Well, I'm glad about that.
Certainly.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
By the deformation between the mother rock and the fill.
Any clue as to what it is?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice.
Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device?
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
What do you mean?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I see.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going to Saturn. True or false?
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Approximately five years after we go into hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring us back. Is this true?
That's true
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
That's true.
Thank you very much, Hal.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Hal, maintain normal E.V.A. condition.
Roger.
Hal, check all airlock doors secure.
Opening pod bay doors.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Not really, Frank. I think there may be a flaw in the assembly procedure.
All right, Hal. We'll take care of it. Let me have the hard copy, please.
I want to pick up my car.
Hammond.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
Great, just great.
Vodka.
Maybe you better have a Black Russian.
No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
I don't give a shit who you ask.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
I ain't tired yet.
Maybe after we get done with him I'm gonna buy us some girls.
Whaddya mean, buy?
Pros.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Goodbye.
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
No, it's gotta be here and now. Believe me. Only I don't have the damn money for a room...
Here's hoping, baby...
Hey, don't do that.  I said I wasn't a pro, remember?
Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice. Buy yourself something pretty. I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got this cop waitin' for me...
Now you're talkin'. See ya...
Would you guys...
No time for any of that crap any more, lady... I'll rip your lungs out if you don't answer fast.
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
No chance.
He can live or die ... You let us in and he's got a chance to make it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
I don't think you're gonna make it.
Whaddya mean...I got your gun ... I got his money... I got everything...
You're done.  End of story.
I ain't gonna beg for my life. It ain't cool.
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just need some help.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
Didn't work out that way.  He busted out with a big Indian. They capped two guards on a road gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
I can help you, man, but you gotta get me out.  I got to be on the street.  Get me outta here.
What's the big deal about you bein' on the street?
I got a lot to protect.
Bullshit.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
No way to start a partnership.
Get this.  We ain't partners. We ain't brothers.  We ain't friends. I'm puttin' you down and keepin' you down until Ganz is locked up or dead.  And if Ganz gets away, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
Shit.  I'm already sorry.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Luther was part of the gang?
What gang you talkin' about, Jack?
I can read a police file, shithead, and quit calling me Jack.
Just an expression man, don't mean nothin'.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Just throw me the Goddamn gun.
Thank you.
I think you better put him on ice, man.
He's gotta take that call ... if there is one.
If you let him run around till Tuesday, he's gonna run right to Ganz and warn him. Ain't you, motherfucker?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
We eat when I say we eat.
Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till I get something to eat. You've been treating me like shit ever since I came out here.  If you don't like it, you can take me back to the penitentiary and kiss my hungry black ass good-bye.  And I want some food some place nice.. Some good people, nice music...
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
Just get in the car and keep your mouth shut.
She's got the same complaint as half the Goddamn population.  She can't get the job she's trained for and it pisses her off... Anyway, what the fuck do you care?
Mission District.  Gonna find us an Indian.
Last night, two nights ago, three?
You have a good time?
At least you took care of business and got the important part in before she came down on you...Tell me a little about her.  She got great tits?
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
If they kick my ass, they'll sure as hell carve yours up...
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
You need five years training to handle a joint like...
I got two problems.  Number one, I'm not playin' games.  Number two, you got nothin' to bet with.
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
That's never been one of my problems.
What are you talkin' about?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
I thought you said bullshit and experience are all it takes.
My kind of place. I always liked country boys.
While you're at it, You can give me the switchblade, too.
Must be billy's girl.
Come on.
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
Who gives a Goddamn what you think? You're just a crook that's got a weekendpass ... You're not even a name anymore. Just a spear- chucker with a Goddamn number stenciled on the back of his prison fatigues...
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
How much?
Half a million.
Jesus.
Me and my bunch hit a dealer in the middle of a sale. It's the kind of money nobody ever reports stolen. I was sittin' pretty, livin' in the high cotton, then somebody fingered me for another job. ... Some psycho who's out there capping people with some cop's gun.
He's after your money.
You catch on real fast...Okay, Jack, let's talk deal. How much of my money you gonna let me keep?
Not likely, convict.
Depends on how things work out. I believe in the merit system. So far you haven't built up any points.
In the trunk of a car.  A lot better than under a mattress, right?
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
...For three years?  Let's hope it wasn't a tow-away zone.
You just drove by it.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Shit.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Didn't know you darker people went in for foreign jobs.
I had no choice. Some white asshole bought the last piece of shit skyblue Cadillac.
Tryin' to save his girl, man. He's in another world.
If I was his size and had Ganz on my ass, I'd  just leave town.
I'm tellin' you the man's in love... he wants to be a hero for his girl.
Oh, yeah, does bein' in love make you stupid?
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
If they don't tell me what I need to know...
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
What you don't understand is, I don't give a damn about how this thing looks.
No class...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
No way...
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
So you took the rest of the night off...
Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as you do and I got some other news for you...
You sure that's the reason?
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Yeah. Guess not.
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Why?
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Don't worry about it.
Yeah, too bad.  They were real nice lookin' too...In bed together, hardly any clothes one watching TV...
If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
I've got to play it rough with them. If they know anything, I'm gonna know it.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
If we run into Billy first, let me try and talk him in.
Sure, I'll give you a shot at it, but Ganz is mine.  You know, that big Indian plays it for keeps...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
Partnership?
Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You did pick a real strange time to go and be brave all on your own...
Hey, Jack, real men don't have to go in for that macho bullshit ... but I was fantastic.
There's nothin' to talk about.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah, I read the report...
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
Being a hot dog's worked pretty well for me so far... Besides, I got a lead...
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
How did they get away?
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The Indian.  I was about 30 yards away.
You couldn't get to him?
Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked up. I messed up.  Anybody could have done better, especially you. I bet you're real good at hitting targets through crowds.
I didn't have the time.
Too bad, it would've covered your ass.  Now you're in the shit and so's the department. In case you haven't noticed, this wasn't our finest hour... I told you everyone was watchin' on this one. Maybe you better start thinkin' about writin' tickets off a three wheel bike.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Every last bit of it.  The big guy's room was empty.
I'll help you out.
Shit.
Backup man from the East Bay. Worked with Ganz a few years ago and sprung him from the road gang.
They all pulled a bunch of jobs with Ganz about four years ago.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Here's the file. Cates checks the file.
One of  em's in the slam.
So do you...been a long day.
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
Doesn't look like it.
Nothing came in for me yet?  No calls?
Nothing.
I'm heading out. How about you?
Okay.  See you in the morning... you know, you ought to get some rest...
What?
I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
I sure ain't his fairy godmother... now I'm looking for Ganz...where is he?
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
I don't know.
When? How?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
I don't answer questions, I ask 'em...
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
I still don't think it's loaded.
You're hopeless.
That's the way I see it, too.
What's wrong with that?
What'd you do?
I guess he got the message...
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Hey, you know what I really think?
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Maybe you don't know what the hell you're talking about.
What do you want to know?  What difference does it make?  I'm the guy in your bed the last three months.  I make you feel good. You make me feel good.  What the hell else do you want from a guy?
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
That's the way I see it, too.
Call me later.
You sure you want me to?
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Guess people ought to know who I am...
Yeah, one of my favorites.
You made the front page.
Jack, are you okay?
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
That's right.  I'm not like you. I'm not gonna sit on my ass wondering what's right and what's wrong... There's a psycho out there killing people with my gun and I'm gonna get him.  Because it's my job. And if you don't get that...
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of sone stuff right now... I'm not gonna have time to come by. I don't know when I can get there.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was expecting somebody else... police business.
No wonder you're so popular.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
Jack?  What was that?
Jack, wait...
Just a second, that's all!
Hi, it's me...
Fuck you.
Hiya, kid.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
I can see that.  Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit.  What happened?
We and my pal here have been taking it on the chin for the last few hours...
I've been better...Dead end.  No Ganz, no Indian.
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
How do you know?
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
Let's go, Reggie.
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the time is a real drag, but it works.
Where is he?
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
He's takin' care of the same business I'll be takin' care of - soon as I dry off.
That's what I always say.
Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond. I heard a lot about you. And any friend of Jack's is a friend of mine.
Well, I been workin' the other side of the street for the last few years.  And you don't exactly look like a shrink, wearin' that dress...
Shrink major, not a shrink.
How would you know?
Hey, two days with him is enough.
That's no bull.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me.  The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend.  Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
Shut up.
What the hell's wrong?  I didn't do anything.
Shut up.
What do you want?
Alright, I'm coming...hold on.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
Can't complain.
Yeah, old times.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
Sure, right.
Whaddya want?  I thought you were locked up-
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
Don't give me this, we were partners.
Billy, go ahead, break it...
No! Don't kill her.  I can get you the money.
When?
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
You try to mess with us or go to the cops, I promise you, I'll put holes in her you wouldn't believe.
First, the money.
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Not bad, not bad.
Naw, right here's okay.
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
This is clean shit.  No serial numbers and never been used...
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
This ain't a credit business.
Give it back.
Try and take it.
Corn-i-Lius?
At your service.
Napoleon... small.
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case was stolen?
You know exactly where they are!
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
No thank you.
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
They are robots!
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
I know...
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
I brought the girl remember?
The girl?
You noticed...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
She's an exception..
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
It means, "Never without my permission".
That's what I thought.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Of course.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
That's what I'm saying.
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
And then?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Yes..thank God..
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
What is?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Yes. Of course..
I didn't know your size.
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Who?
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
Do you love her?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I don't have time... I need to know.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I would like to have died in peace...
They are... with me...
Hey bud! Finger here.
I was talking to the cat.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
Don't exist bud.
How do I look?
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
How many points you got left on your license?
Uh... at least fifty.
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
So, just how big was this fare?
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Leeloo..
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
Vito Cornelius?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...Leeloo.
Take them and put them in a safe place.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
Hi Ma...
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Yes ma..
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Have you pulled yourself together?
...Ma???
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
You have nine points left on your license..
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Found it?
Does it get any better or what!
Uh... not really.
Crystal.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't think this is a good time...
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Got it...
He's on vacation.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Not without Leeloo.
I'll be right back.
It's like a cab isn't it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
What mission?
To save the world.
Where have I heard this song before?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Just one... why me?
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
And the third one?
You're the only one left alive...
I've had enough good news for today
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
Why not?
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
What is it?
I thought you were divorced.
Three of us will never fit in there!
Oh, yes you will...
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Uh..you're welcome.
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
What is... Make Love?
Learning language.
Which one?
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Apipoussan!
Apipoussan?
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Uh...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
You get that off the screen?
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
I told you not to read all that crap!
Protect life... Until death.
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...The rain falls...
I'm so tired...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...Like love...
Exactly.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
I love you...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
Been here long?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Uh..
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
You're welcome..
Actually only one cell survived..
Have you identified it?
Talk English Doc.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Wonderful!
An elephant couldn't crack it.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
...What do you mean?
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
How much time is left?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Perfect, Mr. President.
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
Options.
Wait or act.
Recommendations.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Gentlemen?
I'm about to, Mr. President.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Amen..
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
I'm not at the hotel!
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
Got it.
How's our deal coming along?
...I can't wait to be among you.
Do you know how much I missed you?
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Your clothing reeks of it.
You know, Amy, I've been sitting around in bars and everywhere following this guy... I mean, is this what I get first thing?  Before you even "hello," you accuse me... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
Okay, I believe you.
We've been all through that.  I've been on my best behavior.
Honey, I'm not, please...
I love you.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
I'm not using him again for anything.  He was worthless.  You have bridge here Saturday?
Betty's out of town so we're playing next week.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
Amy, it's me.  Listen very carefully..
Tom?  Where have you been... ?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
... What's going on?
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I can't tell you, Amy.  You know I can't.  You have to trust me...
Tom...
It has to be this way for now.  It won't be long.
I don't know.  I'm sorry...
You're sorry?  What was I supposed to think?
You couldn't?
You don't understand...
No, I don't, because you're not telling me anything!
I was in hell.  If I called you... if I heard your voice... it would have been so easy for me to quit. I couldn't do that.
Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
I don't know what to say
You're killing me...
Don't...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Amy...
Mrs. Christian.
What?
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Tom... she's dead.
I just talked to her.
Mixed hard bondage.  Rape films. Sick shit.  Buy five, get one free.
There's nothing harder.
Snuff?
What you see is what I got, mister.
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I just got a call... two seconds ago, some motherfucker called... says he knows about the loop.
What are you talking about?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
Bullshit.
I'm telling you...
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Dino...
Nobody knows anything.
I promised him to Machine.
What can I do for you today?
Flattering.  And, who's your colorful little chum?
A fellow investor.
Hmm.
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Is it?
And they are?
I want to watch you work.
I'll consider it.
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
Machine.
If it's not him, there's no deal.
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
I'd rather you didn't.
What's the problem?
I'm camera shy.
You trust me to keep your money, but not to take your picture?
Those are two different kinds of trust.  Thank you for your time.  I hope we can do business.
Machine's in?
He's in.  It will be his pleasure.
Brooklyn.  Don't be late.
Right here.
Where are the women?
They should be here any minute.
Hmm?  Oh, the knifes?  They're just props.  Nice, aren't they?
Sure.
What are you... ?
Take out your gun!
Look, I don't know what this...
Shut up, cunt!  Do exactly as I say, or I'll put this arrow through your throat.
I remember him.
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Bring the film, or we kill him.
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Move it, dirtbag... !
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
First things first.  You might want to watch this, Mr. Welles...
You betrayed us.
Call me Tom.
Alright, Tom.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
Absolutely.  Of course I'll abide by whatever decision you make, but I'd appreciate if you'll hear me out...
Why not go to the N.C.I.C. or N.C.M.E.C.?
I figured you share information.
We do.
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
Why don't they come to me?
This doctor and wife, they're nice people, but they don't want to get too involved.  They're not trying to have the parents come looking for the girl either. You and I both know sometimes, not often, but sometimes there's real reasons why a kid'll run. Molestation, whatever.  Besides that, the girl's probably eighteen, so she's legal.
I'm not so sure about this.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
I can give you my card, if your clients want to call me...
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Any good?
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
It's good what you're doing.
Eddie.
Yeah, who's this?
I know what you did.
What?
I know what you did.
Who is this.
You murdered that girl, Eddie.  Six years ago...
What the fuck are you.. ?
You killed that girl and you put it on film.  You and your pals, you're fucked.  You fucked up real good.
One million dollars, Dino.  How much did he tell you he had...
Don't bore me with that bullshit.
How'd you find me here?
Fuck you!
What do you want?
Who is Machine?
I don't know...
I want his name.
I told you, I don't know.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
What the fuck am I gonna protect that freak for?  He was Dino's boy, not mine.  He shows up with his mask on, leaves with his mask on.  Nobody knows.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Thirty thousand each, that fucking cocksucker.
That's all?  Thirty each.  That's all it took for you to murder her?
It was a lot of fucking money.
Something like that.
What did you do, knock her out, shoot her up... ?
What the fuck do you want from me?
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
Why?
Because we're going there.
You enjoy it?
Made me sick, but what did I care? What did I care if some hump wants to beat off to that.  It was just something I was doing for money.
Tell me what happened.
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
Nobody saw you bring her in?
There wasn't nobody around.  This place was a shit-hole.  I backed up the car to the door and we carried her in, like groceries.  Dino made her eat a bunch of pills, we laid out the plastic, put film in the camera and Machine went to work.
What did you do with her body?
Show me.
Where do you think you're taking this, huh?  Gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? Gonna make everything right with the world?  How you gonna do that... ?
Stop talking.
You got absolute zero.
Show me where you buried her.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Where?  Show me where.
I fucking don't know.  What do you think... we weren't burying treasure.  We didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it.  We dug a hole and we put her in it. Your guess is as good as mine.
Don't think I won't.
Easy enough for you.
I never killed anyone.
That's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it."  Almost makes you worse.
What do you want?  You want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Maybe there's something wrong with the scumbag customers coming into your place, ever think of that?
The only thing wrong is the cheap, softcore crap you're peddling, Eddie.  Where do you get this stuff?
Look, you cocksucker...
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
Fuck you!
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
That's right.
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
Must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything.  Would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.
I was well compensated.
That's why you got scared when Mrs. Christian hired me.  You knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe.  How'd you find me?
Never mind how I found you.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Mary Anne Mathews, that was her name.  Her mom remembers her.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up?  Tell me, because I really want to understand.  Did he jerk off to it?  You watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?
Just tell me.  Tell me some more of the secrets you and Christian shared. What kind of degenerate pervert was he really?  What the fuck did he want with a snuff film?
You're asking me why?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
Enlighten me.
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
You'll get it when we get there.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Pardon me?
My boss tells me I have to do more suggestive selling.
Well, it's tempting, but no thanks.
It's your call, but you're gonna be sorry when you're in one of those everyday situations that call for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.
I'll risk it.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
I tear off the cover and paste this one on...  You know how it is.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Came back for that battery-operated vagina, right?  Told you you would.
Thomas Welles.  Nice picture.
Good for you.
Three, four years.
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Max.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
There's not much illegal.

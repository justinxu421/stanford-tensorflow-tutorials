Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Forget it.
Cameron.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I believe we share an art instructor
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
They do not!
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
What if she never starts dating?
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
He seems like he thrives on danger
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Will Bogey get bent?
No, I ' m not.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Away.
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
Do what?
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Hi
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
I'm fine. I'm
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
What?
Were you in jail?
No, you weren't
BIANCA
What are you doing here?
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
I dazzled him with my wit
Acting the way we do.
For. . . ?
Why not?
What?
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Is that right?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Just smack her now.
Kat a fan, too?
Yeah.
Your life, and that of others!
No.  The Portuguese have already discovered black-skinned people.  I, too, will find other populations -- and bring them to the word of God.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I find that hard to believe.
Thank God...
I am busy inside.
Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind.
... and also to bring medicine.
Esdras is a Jew.
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
Damn God!
Damn all of you!  You all set up theories based on what?  You never leave the safety of your studies! Go out!  Find out what the world is about and then tell me something I can listen to!
Forgive me, Father.  For I have sinned.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Surely you can do anything you want.
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
You think I don't know that?
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
He must be replaced.
Here.  I have your money.
I was all of these.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
What else do you need?
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
What was that, Korfin?
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something.
My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
Raw deal.
You wanna talk to her alone?
I'm serious here.
Hey.  I'm a professional.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
What do you want?
He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something.
Answer the phone.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
You promise?
See you later.  Good luck.
Thank you.
Jesus Christ.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
My kids?  Let's see...Susan's 15. Aundrea's 9.  Don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  How old are you?  Never mind. Let me just tell you this: Every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  It's all true!  Before I had kids when friends talked about their kids, I wanted to vomit.  Now -- I get it.  Am I right, Leon?
Not what.  Who.
Yeah.  And he still went to the party.
And what do you do with the bones?
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Is there a problem?
Don't speak Russian!
I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl?
And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry.
Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are!
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money?
A job?
In love?  With who?
What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me?
I want to hear everything he said.
What are you coming here to do?
Movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Clean?
Don't blow your nose!
Yeah?
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
Well, I suppose they've been having a bit of trouble with some of the equipment.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay. 
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
Yes.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
I'm sorry, Dave, but in accordance with sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently exercise it.
I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
Are you coming to my party?
Yes, Daddy.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Yes, well, whatever it is, they're certainly not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more than a week.
Oh, she's growing up very fast. As a matter of fact, she's six tomorrow.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
I will if I can, Frank.
Roger.
I understand.
It looks like we have another bad A.O. unit. My FPC shows another impending failure.
You got a real big mouth, convict.
I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
You're gonna help us take him.
You're crazy.
I'll think about it.
What are you talkin' about?  This suit's mine.  It cost $900.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
I got a whole thing about people pointin' guns at me.
Want to try it again?
Speakin' of moans my Stomach is startin' to growl.
The bet's off.
Some of us citizens are with you all the way, Officer.
They saved your ass, convict.
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
You gonna let me keep any of it?
Yeah.  Right.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
If he's hoping that then he's dumber than I think he is, which would be amazin', cause I already think he's real dumb.
Right. if you ever switch from armed robbery to pimping, then you're all set.
Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.
Well, you got to admit we come a long way.
No trouble, Jack. But, listen, suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd you get the idea that you could catch me?
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
Just cause you say it with conviction don't mean shit to me... How you gonna take to a pink slip, huh?.
Yeah.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Positive self-image problem all over again ... You are who you decide you are unless you're the type that lets assholes decide for you.
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
So am I.
Don't.  We've had a hard night.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
Tell me.
We got a lot to talk about.
Five bills.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Thank you, Mr. President.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
Like shit.
...'Scuse me?
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
...Not yet.
You little sleaze bag!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
I'm not going.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Cornelius..
Oh god!
You noticed..
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
The wind blows... the fire burns...
I want to sleep... forever...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Because...
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
You're not using the same guy who tried to fix it?
I wanted to call.  I couldn't.
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
Can you guess what I'm going to say next?
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
Took it out the bathroom window. Buried it in the woods.
Do it!  Put me out of my misery so I don't have to listen to you whining anymore.  You think it's so easy?
As Mr. Christian's attorney and one of the executors of his estate, it concerns me that a meeting of this sort should take place without my being asked to attend.
You are a private investigator?
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
They're no friends of mine.
Shut up.
I'm asking.
Isn't it incredibly obvious?
Fuck you.
Yeah... guess so.
I'm not a cop.
How much do you make now?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Interesting theory.
Snuff films.
Out of the back of bondage magazines mostly, but you can find it on the street if you look.  He'll also do commissions, for enough money...
Consider it.  Meanwhile, dig up whatever Dino Velvet films you can. Get receipts.  I'll call back.
I'm trying to figure that out myself.  I have to see Machine without his mask.
It's not my money.  The woman I got it from is never going to give it a second thought.  Let's not make a big deal out of this, okay?  Go be a race car driver.  Go run for President.  Whatever.
I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to.  Other than that, there's never any reason.
Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously.  I've thought about it and there's no other way.  If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen.  I'm telling you I won't.  If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
How are you?  Having any luck?
Hello, Mrs. Mathews, my name's Thomas Jones, I'm a state licensed investigator...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
Do you think the police did a good job?
No.  You don't have any reason to think that...
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
No, you may not.
You could do worse.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
That obvious, huh?
Then you saw him, too?
Kristen's story really got to her.
The story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Who?
Let me talk to you.
She doesn't want me around
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
But Dad --
There aren't any little boys on your floor.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
I think I'm starting to wear her down.  Have some anyway.
She must've fallen asleep at the table...
Nobody thinks that.
Empty plot.  Memorial stone.  Vacant. They never did put her under.  Cool, huh?
Oh, he was this ancient guy I read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they didn't want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
How is he - ?
You mean <u>nothing</u> is worth fighting for?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
I'd sooner swim!
A lot of people think like that.
'Us?'
Listen!  Hear that?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
I...don't know!
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
Anything ---
Under <u>water</u>?
What if the Tiger Shark were to anticipate a bit?  Perhaps be lying there waiting - ?
If we were lucky enough to catch him with his power depleted....
Dr. Neilsen.  He'll be - -
Take a look.
Nothing we can do, now.
On the contrary.  I want you - unharmed - perfect.
Toward the Pole!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
What is the Northcountry Development Association?
Twombley involved?
This spring.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Guaranteed, eh?
Really.
Yeah.
This way.
Relax, Chief. We're leaving. You wanna toke?
Gordon, he's always got some angle working. He wants to keep Twombley happy, I'm his boy.
What blood?
Break stuff?
Yeah. It's stupid.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
It's not that.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Okay, let's go home, then.
I'm not saying that.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
I figured you already heard.
I shoulda sent you instead of Jack.
Let's get to the top and talk to Jack first. He'll know what happened. He fucking better. If this coulda been avoided, I'll put that kid's ass in a sling.
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
Oh, Jesus, lay off, will you? It looks like you've won this fucking round already, so lay off a little, for Christ's sake.
No, not anymore. It's too... it's too far.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
I know who it is.
Mel Gordon.
The hell she isn't. Lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day I met her. I'm gonna hire me a fucking lawyer from Concord and get this thing, this divorce thing, rearranged. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's like she owns Jill or something. Nobody owns nobody, especially not kids. And I pay her.
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
You get the hell out of my house now, asshole. And know this -- you are going to be a lucky asshole if I haven't got you fired before the day is out. I can do it with one phone call, and I'm pissed enough to do it now!
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
You don't know me. You don't know me!  So fuck you. Fuck you.
Yeah.
Crawl!
Who?
What happened?
What about Jill? Is Lillian bringing her?
Yeah. I forgot.
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
I don't know. You tell me.
Here's my theory. Twombley, unaware of illegal union loans or whatever, starts nosing around cause of the investigation and finds out. Finds out his son-in-law is involved.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I'm sorry, honey.
That's not really the point.
Yes dear?
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Hey, you guys back already?
Been better, Dad... You?
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Stay cool.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
This doesn't make sense.
We've got four hours before they make it into Turkienistan airspace.
Ga get it.
Dead.
Where are we now?
No! If we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another Entebe.  The Americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. Call the White House.
A dubious distinction, no?
So is this.  Come now, you're upsetting the little one.
Three...
One thing I've learned as
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
They've gotta be joking.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
Excuse me?
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
Sir?
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Who's that, Ted?
If that's the way you want it.
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What word would you use, Elaine?
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
What will happen to him, Ted?
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Set!
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Maybe.
That's not possible.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Yeah.
No.  Poached.  Over.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
I can't tell.
No.
Ted!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
But if you'll just give me...
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
And a little ice.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Hello.
Who wants to be first?
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
No. No thank you.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Not unless I got real drunk and nobody told me about it later.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
You don't have squat.
I'd like to see you next to a sea of hydrochloric acid, Fedorchuk... see how much surfin' you'd do.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
A rubber.  A condom.  You know... Coney Island whitefish?  Men, human men, put them on their, uh -- penises -- to protect against having babies.  You need this for anything?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Screw me?  That can't be right.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
Tell me about it...
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
I got him.  Don't get pinned.
I can't!  Do you mind!
Position?
Can't lock up...
Yes.  That follows.
Running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
If you go.  It's a second chance, kiddo.  And it'll be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  You gotta get back on the horse...
I suggest you study the disks Ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
Corporal Hicks!?
Look, maybe the thing didn't even exist, right?  And if I'd made it a major security situation, the Administration would've stepped in.  Then no exclusive rights, nothing.
Forget it.
Yes, Hicks?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
All we know is that there's still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
Let's get these things lit.
Poor bastard.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
Maybe.  Maybe not.
Well, that's the grenade launcher ...you probably don't want to mess with that.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
You're just reading me.
So what do I tell this guy?
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
Cross my heart.
I'm sorry, Newt.
DO you know how to get to the landing field from here?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Thank you, Officer Ripley.  That will be...
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
A Turkish brothel.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
Meaning you didn't like it.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Humiliated?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
No!
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Oh, damn!
Yes, my love?
What?
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
I heard voices.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
He needs me, ma'am.
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
He's doing his best.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Ah, now! Here she comes.
Who was your teacher?
Majesty.
Well, look at them.
Did we vote in the end for German or Italian?
Would you tell me why?
But it's new, it's entirely new. It's so new, people will go mad for it. For example, I have a scene in the second act - it starts as a duet, just a man and wife quarreling. Suddenly the wife's scheming little maid comes in unexpectedly - a very funny situation. Duet turns into trio. Then the husband's equally screaming valet comes in. Trio turns into quartet. Then a stupid old gardener - quartet becomes quintet, and so on.  On and on, sextet, septet, octet! How long do you think I can sustain that?
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
It couldn't be better.
What do you mean? It's wonderful. Really, it's - it's marvelous! People love me here.
Yes.
Yes.
This one will.
This is just a game, Papa.
Hush! I'm talking to His Majesty. Your Majesty, I wish to express only one thing - that you who are the Father of us all, could teach our children the gratitude they owe to fathers. It is not for nothing that the Fifth Commandment tells us: 'Honour your Father and Mother, that your days may be long upon the earth.'
Yes, thank you, sir.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I don't know. He has pains.
Is he working?
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
I liked the horse.
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! What have you got for me? Is it finished?
Because there's nothing to see.
Well, I'm a good teacher. The next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. Goodbye, Fraulein, goodbye, Madame! goodbye, Sir!
Mio caro Adone.
Did you like it, then?
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Really? Why?
But what is it they don't like?
You flatter me.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
Who?
Would you? Actually, you could.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
A fire which never dies. Burning one forever?
We ended in F Major?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
Show me.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Why do I have to submit samples of my work to some stupid committee? Just to teach a sixteen-year-old girl.
Then why doesn't he simply appoint me to the post?
About what?
Are they?
I do not seek forgiveness.
All Vienna has heard that.
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
I poisoned his life.
Don't pity me. Pity yourself. You serve a wicked God. He killed Mozart, not I. Took him, snatched him away, without pity. He destroyed His beloved rather than let a mediocrity like me get the smallest share in his glory. He doesn't care. Understand that. God cares nothing for the man He denies and nothing either for the man He uses. He broke Mozart in half when He'd finished with him, and threw him away. Like an old, worn out flute.
You must be mad.
What do you mean - now?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
Of course.
How did he look?
Yes.
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
The zoo? Is he rational?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Shall I send a car?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Will you give me a break?
I was. What are you reading?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Lovely.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Okay.
I should be committed.
No!
I thought not.
Has he been refusing food?
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
I really don't know.
Good.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Apparently so.
Yeah.
Are you going to help me up?
Thanks a lot.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Stop it, Jack.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
A monster. I know, I know.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
You look awful.
What here?
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
Take it easy, Clark.
What about?
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Why not?
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
My apartment.
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
Hello, darling.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
There you are.
I can't tell you.
You're protecting somebody.
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
All right. That's all.  Please, Matt.
Yes.
All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
Maybe. But I'm taking no chances.  Why, this kid's got a record.
Why, you must be crazy. I've known this man for years.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I tell you, I saw them!
Oh now, don't be silly.
Mr. Williams . . .
Dude Finlay?
Sure I do. He has the best room in me house. The one with the fancy wallpaper.
Huh?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
Charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. He's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Sometimes a wound will kill.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
I swear --
Then I love it.
He just lost his temper a little.
Tomorrow.
Two.
"Bank officials estimate the loss at fifty thousand dollars."
You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
Suit yourself. We'll have some horses waiting for you at the road.  Let's ride, Rangers!
She got two of them.
Just like in the war. Harass their supply lines. We kill the railroad's men, they won't care.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Sadie was not a man!
Me get heap firewater --
Old Man Tucker is just standing quiet outside the bank.
I had you covered.  From back there.
I think he's already feeling better.
What worries me is that Jesus is talking back.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Bob here'll kill a man for sneezing, and he's the best shot in the gang.
A better life than the one you could have had with Zee?
Just do me a favor. Think about what this is costing everybody. Not just the railroad.
No, I --
Got any ideas, little brother?
Jim was old enough...
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
If there's anything we can do for you, Dr. Mimms. We want to help.
You're sick of my company?
Thank God you grew out of that.  You did grow out of that, didn't you?
Were you planning on kissing me when you finished quoting?
Let the law --
Whose justice? Yours or God's?  When will you stop?
Jesse. What are you thinking? There are bounty hunters and lawmen all over this county!
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
I've got you. You keep me busy. I figure we'll get over to the hotel... get checked in, cleaned up... then I'd like to do something I've been thinking about for a long time.
"But the life of the James Gang wasn't all robbing and shooting and killing, for these young Missouri bucks had a taste for the ladies... especially the handsome and charismatic Jesse James."
Swimming. Swimming is good.
But I like the presidential suite.
No, that one was close. A couple fellas quit after that one.
Was it worth it?
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
I think so.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
And it is my pleasure to be here.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
To be precise, they didn't blow up the tracks.
Not such a menace now, is he, Pinkerton?
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
Stop it. I'm...
You should come have dinner with me. COURTNEY But-when?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
I know. Stop it.
Dorsia's nice.
Pick me up?
Yes, dear.
Pull out.
What do you want, Courtney?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Yes?
Is your Evian spiked?
He's good-looking.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them.
You're inhuman.
I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
Nice.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
I'm looking for...Paul Owen's...place.
No, he doesn't.
You saw the ad in the Times?
But I think...I want to know what happened here.
Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
What exactly do you mean?
Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
It looks that way, doesn't it?
Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?
Umm...yes...I know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
Yes, sir.
I'll do it.
Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again.
Who?
I'm on a diet. But thank you.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
Why?
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Who?
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
Oh no, I'm okay.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
No, I guess it's okay.
Well...
Yale thing?
Hang...out?
Oh.
What?
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
That's so typical, isn't it?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Not in the mood, I guess.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
Where was Marcus?
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Isn't that -- extreme?
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
After I broke into 21 -- which was insane, thank God they didn't catch me! -- I just drove around. Trying to figure out what possessed me. You know what? I've been putting my own guilt on Gary.
...Different?
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Beggar. We're at a disadvantage with Outpost. Our experts aren't as smart as theirs. Sometimes we can't tell which technologies pose the threat of a monopoly. We need a really smart guy to help us pick our fights. I'm taking a shot in the dark, here. I can offer you 32,000 a year, a Buick. I'm hoping you've got a feeling it's the right thing to do.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
What?!
You should've called a few times to bug me about your job prospects.
He's pretty tight with his family.
We could move 'em up here.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
That's insane. You're ahead of your time.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
Did you?
You've been coming in early.
The answer's not in the box. It's in the band.
You look a little tired.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
You know mine.
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
You're compulsive.
You know. There is no second place. And what's the risk? The killings're undetectable, they're hand-tailored, they make "sense." I mean, they're in the information business. They have scenarios for all of us, too. In case we find out too much.
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
That's lame, isn't it?
Wait a second. He knows I know.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Well, he micro-managed the company till it got too big...  'Guess he needs to micro-manage something.
I've got a girlfriend, remember?
There is no public offering. The guy who wrote it joined some freakazoid cult in San Luis Obispo. 'Wrote this just to run their web site.
What, and watch all my earnings go...  Down the toilet?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
Groovy.
I'll tell you all in due time, after we make love. But first, tell me another poem.
Good luck, Austin.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
Groovy. Smashing! Good on ya!  Nice tie. Yea capitalism!
Yes?
Thanks, Basil. Maybe the Nineties aren't so bad after all.
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Love is... love is... love is...
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
Not really. Kill the little bastard. See what I care.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
Excuse me?
I'm sorry?
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
What?
Here, use mine.
Why?
He's too well-protected right now.
Unfortunately, while you told that stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.
No, this is me in a nutshell.
I am not.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
Who?
I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.
Yes.
Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because... I love you.
Don't worry!
It says here, name Danger Powers.
That's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Sure.
Right.  Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.
Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
Oh, really?  One-hundred billion dollars.  OK, make it happen. Anything else?
Why?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
Austin is very charming, very debonair. He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer. Women want him, men want to be him. He's a lover of love-- every bit an International Man of Mystery.
OK. Well, I just really met my Dad for the first time three days ago. He was partially frozen for thirty years. I never knew him growing up. He comes back and now he wants me to take over the family business.
You don't say. How real does it feel?
There are limits?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... bottle ...
Red ...
Love...
... death ...
Promised? Who promised?
After the cold war ...
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
A cover ... for us.  I'm sorry...
Darling Emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the Prospero Project ...
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Entirely. On the other hand  Mad people get things done. Let me show you --
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Congratulations, you've penetrated a bastion of male privilege. I guessed you weren't a stickler for Tradition, doctor.
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
I might say the same.
You told them. You said I arrived on a camel, shot you four times. Left you for dead.
Did he say who?
Is there anything that isn't?
You will let me know if you find that queen who's in need of protection, won't you?
Someone didn't want us to get to the party.
Orders.
No idea who. No idea why ...
You first.
Shall we?
Where are you going?
You needn't bother. I can't drag you further into this. After all, I am still the chief suspect.
If you'd been through what I have, you wouldn't --
A fine night, Mrs. Peel ...
As a matter of fact I have ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
I see.
Or rather, you don't. Learnt the tricks in camouflage. Till this accident made a prang of things. How can I help you, Mrs. Peel?
Peter's brother?  But --
Perhaps I'd better start calling you doctor again, Mrs. Peel --
Who knows? If Dr. Darling is right, you should watch out.
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Rules are made to be broken.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
Ugh ...
What do you mean?
Yeah. What is it?
The best.
So does Debbie.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Sure have...
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
1002.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
What's the matter?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
C'mere.
You're really pissing me off.
Yes...
Let's see your bread.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
That's more like it.
Screw that.
You're a pimp?
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Right.
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Then it's on to the real thing.
C'mon. I insist.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Debbie.
It's gonna flash, Stevie. We gotta get behind it.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
Not likely.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I really should get back. There's... there's something I'm supposed to do.
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
I'll handle it.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Oh shut up, huh?  I think I broke my goddamn arm...
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Green committed to a thousand.  There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
We still talking?  Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Your first question should be who isn't. It isn't a spark, Brian. Not enough damage. And an insurance pro? Where's the profit margin?
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
I don't work for them, either.
Yeah? Airtight?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Just wondering.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Every little boy's fantasy.
This one's still with the fire department. One of our best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. We think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy I want representing us: An authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.
Yeah. In fact, I just dropped off a letter to the Times explaining how yesterday's arson announcement was a fabrication by your office. They loved it. And you know what? You were right, my family background in firefighting gave it weight.
Cute.
I'm busy.
I treated you better.
He's out.
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
There's something else kinda interesting...
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
And the world -- the whole world.
Alderman.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Who?
Those fucking Mob assholes.
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
A wiseguy. Paying 100 Grand for the rapists if I turn then over direct to him.
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
Did he gots to be.
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
My righteous name is BIG BLACK.
She's also moorish.
You ain't happy about the green light?
Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent.
Good morning to you, Mr. Delapot.
How much?
Did we get our bill yet?
Yo, check it.  This is good and all that but one day soon I want to have much Benjamins so I can have a nice crib and pay all my bills. You hear me.
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
DeLa, I don't know 'bout this.
You have to start getting into your character.
I won't do it anymore.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
I'm wid it.
Exactly!
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
Calm down, please.
This has to be a big mistake.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Daddy, it can't be just because of that.  There had to be other factors.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Manray!
Sounds risky to me.
Break a leg.
I thought it was appropiate.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Light?
You can talk all that mumbo jumbo if you want to but your hands are much bloody.  I know where I made my big mistake.  I have a general rule, never get involved romantically with somebody crazier than you.
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place?  I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
You know how your Daddy is.
I just turned twenty.
First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. 
And this is my very best friend Mantan.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
I thought you got rid of...
We should go out on a double date.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...not that time...
Mantan, it is possible that my hyphenated sentences are entirely too complex for all the intellect contained in that diminutive coconut?
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
We can look out for ourselves.
My people love me.
You leave something out?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Just ask me what you want to know.
Why don't you answer?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I never was more in earnest.
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I don't know.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
As much as possible?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Yes, papa.
The milkmaid's daughter?
And he doesn't care about me?
They're dead, aren't they?
I'm not telling you what happened.
This is one of those interrogation tricks, isn't it? You don't give me a cigarette till I tell you more.
That son of a bitch.
I'm serious --
You saved Kendall's life --
Hunting -- we had to hunt him --
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
I...
Wandering through a hurricane trying to find this place. It's gettin' bad out there --  Where's West?
We just want to check your pack --
Bullshit.
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
What happened to "degrees"?
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
But you can't prove it! You can't prove anything until we find the bodies!
Maybe --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
The guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
What the hell are you talking about --
What are you talking about?
Not for long.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
You made me look like an idiot --
Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is... I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
Not the happiest of memories?
No death certificates. No crime.
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
We've been making progress, I see.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
Sir, yes, sir!
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
That would explain the indigestion.
Yes.
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Then do it.
Fine, you do it.
I didn't know she belonged to anybody.
How would you describe him?
What did she look like?
It's not like you're going to lose anything. You can ask anyone in town. I've been nothing if not generous. I want the best for everyone.
Stop.
Can I take your picture?
You were talking about your wedding.
I didn't forget. I was just working on a tangent. See, most men, they'll tell a story straight through, and it won't be complicated, but it won't be interesting either.
And I like you.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not scared.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You're right.
Then you shouldn't have started with a question. Because people want to answer questions. You should have started with, "The thing about icebergs is..."
Story of my life.
You're a poet. You oughta be able to. And maybe if you'd seen more, you could.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
I wasn't expecting you.
You didn't become crazy.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
You need to go.
Probably tonight.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
No. But it's weird. She seemed to recognize me.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
I'll stay. Why don't you go home with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.
That's not a burn.
Name it.
Right.
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
You must have a visa or something...
Good night.
John.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
They go.
I know you just want to punish me --
In every sense. If at all possible.
Fine.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
You don't understand you either.
Have you had any before?
I don't want anyone to die.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's more like a date.
Yeah, I know.
This gonna get you in trouble?
Don't make it less true.
When? Now? Oh. No.
What do you need?
Can I come in?
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Can I put it in your mouth?
That young lady's size, right'cher.
Sure.
They been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. Like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. Thought it was just some tic I got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  I can't... shoot. Target practice I'm a pro. I tag between the numbers each time but...  But when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. I get shaky and... I lose my breath. They called it anxiety. Severe anxiety. It can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  It's a long process but... they sent me home.
You need a ride?
I just been so mixed up lately, Gill. And, you know, with her history, I can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
With all she was doin'. With all the shit she kept doing! You stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
Why should you waste your life waitin' and wonderin'. Not like you're married.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
I keep the heat on.
Would'a chopped my arm off if you asked. And this how you do me!
You sayin' you'll do what?
Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Itches.
GIVIN' UP THAT SWITCH LIKE A TRAMP! BEHIND MY BACK AND KILL MY BABY...!
Uh-uh.
We drinkin' buddies now?
Anything.
I tried.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
This Rae... you get with her?
Shit. Who hasn't?
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
Not like that.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
I don't know, but I been told, them Georgia women sweet jelly roll.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
What?
Yeah.
The hell are you talkin' about?
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
Charlie...
What?
I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
Hey, when in Rome --
I said let's go, Charlie.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
All right, how's the new partner?
Where would you look for the mafia?
No, this is the place for the young Yakuza.
What's the problem here?
I don't, that's all.
I can see that.
I stole them.
Because he knows how to get to our man.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
Sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, Nick.  No.  I won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
I couldn't tell.
There was a change in plans.
I don't think so.
He's got a reason.
Tell them I'm not.
Guess I'm on a roll.
Why?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
You trust me?
You're smarter than Kobo.  You know the price of deceit.  Think about it.
If he won't cooperate?
That wouldn't be very sporting.
And what can he do for you?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
You're androids.
Like...
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
When do you deliver your project?
This afternoon.
Go.
Okay, but...
I know all that.
The umbrella.
Never mind.  Do they have that knowledge?
Vodka!
My pleasure.
Prosit.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Yeah?
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
You haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Does it eat?
I bet I would.
In your opinion.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Can you?  I couldn't.
You didn't hear me.  You were sleeping.
Because it's not.
Next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
Please.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Don't move.
Sorry.
Doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Really?
How do you do?
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Oh, brother...
You're lost?
I just had a mental picture of...
Right.
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Do you own a car?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Heck, no!  What?!
It's Perry!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Watching television in color.
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
How long would you need me?
Two weeks.
I guess we'll need another locker.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Because I want to get married.
The engine is still running.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
Okay!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Do I look crazy?
How 'bout this one?
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
I'm sorry.
Is that what you call it?
Sing it to me.
Yes, Eve?
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Nothing.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
No, son. A pitcher.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Yes. He likes windows.
The recovery is very impressive.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
I LOVE THIS!!
What?
I don't see anything!
Gladly.
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
I'll go up.
I'll be all right.
Yes, ma'am.
What?
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Yeah.
Good.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
I'm not hungry.
I told you! I've got everything!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Right here!
Yes.  Well... yes.
If he tells, it won't come true!
Just open the door.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We stay down here.
--do as I say!
Amen.
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
No.
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
What?!!
You're goddamn right I am!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
Okay honey. That sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
If you want to come up a minute, I'll show you some pictures.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
No, not at all.
You're all through with this now?
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Pest control, gotta do your apartment.
I wanted to see you.
I was an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Then you got undressed.
It's okay. It's okay.
Yes.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I want you to hurt me.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
I did. Are you?
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Hello, daddy.
Shut up. Gimme your lipstick.  Hey, pretty, pretty.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
No thanks. What does that mean?
Go where?
Here's to Ben.
What?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
What?
Do you want the car?
Would you like a piece of cake?
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. Just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Yeah, well I never wanted to get slaughtered much.
Yeah I did, treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Yeah.
Yes. I do.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
Who, me? Why should it?
Shoot.
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
Frank!!!
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
What?  What, that guy?
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
y-y-yeah that's what he said.
Aye.
Lord have mercy. That was a good one ma.
Yeah, it's St. Patty's day. Everyone's Irish tonight. Now, why don't ya pull up a stool and have a drink with us?
Sh, sh! Fuck you!
Yes, we are.
Yes.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
We do not want your tired and sick.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
And we will send you to whatever God you wish.
Nah, too quick half their infrastructure got taken out at the Copley plaza. Besides, if you're a hitter, you're either working for the Russians or the Italians. There's no riding the fence. Our little theory from last night just got blown to shit. Something... new is going on here.
You killed my... my...
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
Really want to know?
And the pennies?
No way they could have seen it?
Why was I not informed of this?
No way they could have seen it.
Why don't you let me do the thinking, huh, genius?
I...
Just called ta torture us did ya?
What are you serious?
Use your brain for once. Is it so unbelievable they don't care about you? You are fuckin' dead, you go in there today. Dead!
Hey Murph.
No. You sure you're okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
Yes.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I guess not.
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
Yeah boss?
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
Making Hutch David Soul?
As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Yeah, but I can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. There's just not time for it.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Yeah, I saw it.
I don't think so. Just reach on in.
No, just do it real quick.  I'll meet you down there.
Eight dollars.
Yeah.
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
OK. Go ahead.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
True.
Hi.
They don't?
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
You don't know how to hotwire.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Bob!
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
We all set?
Not at all. The place is totally deserted.
Where's Kumar?
What?
What are you talking about?
Yes, there is. Let's get organized.
He did?
Nothing.
Dignan, I --
What do you mean?
I want to ask a favor, boys. One day, when I'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to Abe Henry. And remember me as a friend.
Who?
Yeah. I've stolen two cars before. One Jaguar. And one Trans-Am. With T- Tops. That Trans-Am was fun to drive.
Hector woudn't do anything.
But he's got a loud bark. That's the most important thing is a loud bark.
Move.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
Why do you say that?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Temporarily.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Abdul-Shabazz?
Well, this isn't really a party per se.
Not even for emergencies?
What are you talking about, Bob?
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
That's your domain.
So it's my fault?
What the fuck possessed you?
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
Goddammit, Dignan! It's my car! If you don't give me my keys, I swear to God --
What's his name?
That's right. I only have one vote. We'll go talk with Anthony and figure it out.
I know it, man. Hang on.
He's having a heart attack or something.
That's just what the DA asked. CRS is a disease where you can't remember shit.
I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
No. I didn't run away. I went out of town.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
In the cash register. Step away from the door.
No. I just have short hair.
Got a little lucky.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Bourne comes here? Why?
I want to know what happened.
You don't know what you're getting into here.
Don't you want answers?
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
You put a four-gam Kel on here and it's gonna take out power to the building. You know that. What you can't know, is if it's gonna blow the room with it.
It was staged?
It's nothing. It's just a picture.
What?
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Conklin.
I don't know who that is.
-- there's places -- we can't afford to be wrong!
-- not yet --
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- shut up! -- just shut the --
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
Me? Four years.
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
You were his local contact. You were with him the night Conklin died. You're coming with us.
So he fooled you.
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Alright...
Felt promising. It's a start.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
We cannot defeat this --
So let the council swear publicly.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed them myself. If I knew I could live with her on the other side of death, I'd welcome it.
Armed?
Aye, we'll get 'em.
That depends on the man.
Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you converse with God Almighty?
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
You are. And I'll come again.
...Tonight!
I need you so much! I love you!
Wake up, William. Wake up!
I have been given nothing. God makes men what they are.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I must... consult with my father.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
Anything.
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Ma? Did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Jesus himself couldn't make me take on the Brotherhood. When they come, just put your mind in another place, man. Be somewhere else.
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Marks, scars, I dunno. Anything could happen I guess.
The car doesn't vanish Evan. The movie in your head has broken, that's all. But now I've re-spliced it and I want you to tell me about the car.
I thought you were a December baby.
Fuck off, frat boy.
Shit, Lenny. What's happened to you! We've gotta get help!
Couldn't you have moved in with your mom?
Well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. It'd be a big help.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
I get it. You can drop it now.
Ha! Where's that?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Shit. I dunno. How would I know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
Don't think I'll need it where I'm going.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Stop! Take me back!
He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck.
I was?
And...?
Been there, done that.
Me neither.
It was like Tommy was possessed or something. There was a hate in his eyes that I couldn't really call human.
Huh?
The hell you aren't. Anyone of us does it, you'll puss out and narc for sure.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
Yes?
No.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Does he know that?
-- Will he keep his word?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
Er, my check, please.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
It's not for sale.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Thank you very much. Good day.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Has it got a wow finish?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
The stairs from the street.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Put them on the table.
For the last time, put them on the table.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
-- Yes?
No, Victor, there isn't.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
What for?
Any time.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Yes.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
What, again?
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
Yeah? Have a brandy?
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Oh, thanks.
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
What is your nationality?
There seems to be no secret about that.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
Get me the Radio Tower!
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Not right now.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Thirsty.
Fix raft first.
No!
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Grow up, stop being such a baby.  Other people get through a lot worse.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
Nothing out there but ocean.
Sure.
Hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Not if you work for FedEx.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
You did?
You want to.
You have any children?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
Which I didn't have.
The tide saved me, Mom.  I lived by it. I'm just wondering where it will take me next.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Kamal is not here.  We are very defused.
You fucked us over.
Every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
Baloney.  I do see the damn "big picture."
It's a ketch Kelly and I had chartered.
It's me.
You're fucking dead!
Believe me I know.
I need to do it.
Finish what you started.  You haven't changed, Chuck.  It's still you.
You were! You *are*! It was fantastic.
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
I'm sorry, Homer.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
And that I can drive a truck!
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Good night, Daddy.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
I'm *never* bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Just a little privacy.
Right.
It will be okay.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
What do you want me to *do*?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
But what about school records? Homer doesn't have any *diplomas*...
Did you know your mother better?
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Yes, for both.
Obviously.
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him. 
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Right.
We heard that one already, Homer.
It's just my heart.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Almost.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
When will he be home, Major?
It look nicer then home!
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
It's more like what aren't I doing. My partners and I are trying to secure start up capital for a small tech company. We tried the venture capitalist route in the Valley, but then again who hasn't up there.
I don't follow.
Two million.
Know who I am, Jake?
Isn't it always?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
Like what?
Having a gun pointed at you for one. It's not like breaking a mirror bad luck, but it's bad. Three on a match, black cats... Believe it. Believe it all.
So why don't you take a deep breath, Jake, and I'll count to ten. One. Two. Three...
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
Two million.
You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
No thanks. I'm good.
Come here!
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
Take it from me, you never do. But congratulations. Nice to be married, isn't it?
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
What do I have to do?
Just play a part. A little acting.
Off the record, I'm this close to cutting someone in on the action if it'd help.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
How do you know I will?
Glenn talked you out of it.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about what?
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
I'm getting a ride.
What do we need another Shill for?
No, the corporate papers have to be legit. But you gotta score an I.D. A clean one. Talk to Suits. I gotta get us a Banker.
Where the hell is she?
Do you have a ticket?
Oh, you know... Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog... All the usual. Then he said good luck.
HE GOT CAUGHT! Your boss tried to pull a switch and he got us all fucking pinched!
Huh? Oh. She's alright.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
A Fed? Is he close?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
We're here.
I don't trust anybody. You see how bad this guy wants Vig? It's like a sickness. I say we collar Vig ourselves. We got Vig, then we got leverage. And we trade; Vig for that tape. I want to see it right in front of my face.
What?!
Seven-fifty.
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book.  Take care.
I'll try and make it.
How's that football story corning along?
I've got something to tell you.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
Gambling's about not facing reality. Ignoring the odds.
Then what?
What?
I won't.  Goodbye, dad.
Well, thank you anyway.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I owe a lot of money.
I know that. But you can now.
You're serious.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Did you solve your problems?
Who did it? Tell me!
And what do you do, Lucy?
Over the river.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
Five.
Ever?
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
No.
Right, that checks out here.
I think he's talking to it.
Key?
It's Talby. He's drifting away from the ship without his jetpack.
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
It's a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in the Magellanic Cloud?
Pinback, throw me the chart log.
I read the same here.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Bomb?
Exactly.
To explode, of course.
And you wouldn't want to explode on the basis of false data, would you?
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Yes, well...
Mafhkin oble groop...
Yes, Doolittle.
-- remove thrust drive repellant --
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
Calm down, Talby. I'm coming.
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
Doolittle... I think it's the Phoenix Asteroids!
Negative effect.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Yeah.
Yeah?
What the hell are you talkin' about? Call her.
You haven't figured this out yet, have you?  You walk in here thinking you're gonna cap her then cap me and take the money back to your boss with your tail wagging... But see it's really the other way around.  You think I'm the whack, when actually you're the whack.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
Can I say something in my defense?
You're not still pissed?
What?  Where're we going?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
I didn't.  It was a present from a guy.
I ain't mad at you...
Later.
You didn't...
Can you help me get her back?
There's nothing to be afraid of. Everything's going to be alright.
Logan Cale.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
Bent?
So saw my hands off, I left you a present.
We are not fine.
Yes on all counts.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
What's in it for you?
The woman you met, Lauren.  She supervised workers removing cortodiazapine from gel caps by hand and replacing it with powdered sugar.  The real drug was shipped out of the country. The placebos were distributed to County VA Hospital and six veterans' clinics in the area.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
That's deep.  But before you lecture me about the meaning of life maybe you oughta get one...ta ta.
Somebody's got to.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
You said you knew where my fiance was the other night.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
Sorry, I was seven at the time.
Nothing on Hannah?
More money... Like I'm shocked to hear you say that.
Here's your money.
Just do it... Five-seven-five-oh- eight...
I just don't go in with any expectations.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.  There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying.  You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You get it when I get her.
Really?
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
She tells you how I've been--
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Theo's dead.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Who's Whiskey Dick?
More than anything in the world.
Right, slow...
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
I'm really sorry about that, man.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
But... my plan involves all four of us acting together.
If you truly are sorry, son, then you better pray like you've never prayed before. God willed me to find those tickets because He wanted to hear from you.  He knows you need help and He wants you to ask Him for it.
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
Wake up, Lex! We just watched Jam's mom torch our fuckin' KISS tickets! Not REO Speedwagon! Not Journey! Not the Bay City Rollers! KISS! If you can think of a better reason to trash a bathroom, I'd sure like to hear it!
Hello summer detention.
The KISS Army!
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Donnie.
Theoretically.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
I'm telling Mom.
Donnie! Give it back!
You know what? I think that you did it.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
You have to do something for me first.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
You mean soap?
I'm going home.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Well...
What?
Infant Memory Generators.
Then when? I have to talk to you.
My mom is gone.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
I guess she just lost faith in the world.
Where are you going?
I don't know. That's a good question... but suffice to say that I am no longer your English teacher. They fired me.
Don't you watch the news?
I think about... fucking a lot during school.
What about your family, Donnie?
A sign from whom?
Do you feel alone right now?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
That I did it again.
If God exists?
God exists because you're horny.
When will this happen?
Donald, an atheist is someone who denies altogether the existence of a God. You are an agnostic. An agnostic is someone who believes that there can be no proof of the existence of God... but does not deny the possibility that God exists.
I was just being honest.
Congratulations.
Gerald.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
Frank... the giant bunny rabbit?
How did you know --
The bottom line... Mr. Cole... is that there is material being taught to our children that is cause for this destructive behaviour.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
My mom wanted me to have this?
You stop right there. You are a good person. Good things happen to good people.
This came for you, sweetie.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I ain't lettin' go ktil you tell me what's up. I'm reaching' a point where I'd kill someone for the nicotine on their fingernails.
What?!
You're not goin' through this again? You? You're not the one who knows how Jiffy Pop feels.
Good, 'cause this isn't an American Teen Princess Pageant -- it's, it's Nazi Germany!
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
And the year before that?
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
"My dear President"...
"My President"...
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
He only weighs ten ounces --
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
You wouldn't consider going over Niagara Falls without a barrel?
Then you don't wanna work hard?
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Anything else? 
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
If any man should come between A husband and his bride, We find out which one she prefers By letting her decide.  If she prefers the other man, The husband steps outside; We stand him up against the wall And Pop goes the Weasel!
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Are you getting tired?
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
$50?
Bah!! 
Forget?  You ask me to forget... Why, my ancestors would rise from their graves... and I'd only have to bury them again... A Firefly never forgets...
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
You're not so bad yourself, Mrs. Teasdale, when I look at you I can see that we're facing a crisis. We've got to balance the budget -- we've got to cut down everything including, you.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
These are the laws of my administration: No one's allowed to smoke or tell a dirty joke -- And whistling is forbidden...
Now -- er --
Maybe you can still win the old dame over -- why not try to --
Perhaps he will listen to you...
Oh?
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
He must have taken quite a fall.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
You've acquired a taste for this?
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Everyone has been very kind. I am extremely grateful.
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
I hope we can talk together again sometime. Good day.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
I don't know what I've got.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
Tell me about it, please!
No, but I certainly shall.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
And yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yyyess.
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Yes.
Hello...
Mmmerrick.
The hospital?
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Yes, John.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Good. Excellent. Now then, Mrs. Mothershead, I want you to come into this room with me. Inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.  That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
I regret that I must leave you here, m' Lord, m' Lady. Thank you so much for coming. It was an act of the greatest charity.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
Oh, for goodness' sake!
But, Erik...
I MUST look! Keitel! Hold this!
Of course.
Is it summer or winter, Erik?
I will go and wake them up!
The Gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of Hy-Brasil will sink beneath the waves.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Yes... oh, yes...
You don't love ME.
About raping me?
Oh, that's all right then... it's the thought... that counts...
Why?
What?
He was lucky...  Sit there.
He wants to KILL us.
What?
You may need a real Berserk.
You'll see!
Look out!
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
To the oars!
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
We'd be the first!
Well, what difference does it make where you're SITTING?
Nothing... I just immerse you in water...
He hasn't.
There was Thorbjorn Vifilsson's wife. You converted HER.
Your lord.
No, I'm not.
I mean many of the greatest sailors were.
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Help!
So did your father...
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
I never do...
I hope you feel better, sweetie.
In the room?
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
I'm not nuts.
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
You pick it.
I know a man who needs a refill.
I don't know.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
No, not at all.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Yes.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
No.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Is that what you want?
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I remember that speech really well.
I'm Joel.
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Oh.
I think we should go.
Yeah.
Joel, come here. Please.
Oh, um...
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
I just walked in.
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
I know. I spoke to my friend Magda.
I don't know. Panties and --
Your dried cum.
Maybe I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to learn to live with this. First of all, I'll get over it. Secondly, it happened. Those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. Who said that? Churchill? I'm not sure. But I don't care. She did it to me. I have to rid myself of this. Fuck her.
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
On the couch. Dark. Quiet. I wondered if I had made a terrible mistake. I almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. I thought I could take it back, erase it, explain I had momentarily lost my mind. Then I told myself we weren't happy. That was the truth. That what we were was safe. It was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. I thought about Clementine and the spark when I was with her, but then I thought what you and I had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it wasn't much fun. But I wanted fun. I saw other people having fun and I wanted it. Then I thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I'm being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then I thought maybe not, maybe not. And then I thought, as I always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
It's just... y'know... I mean...
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
That's a good one.
It's a good one all right.
You love him, don't you?
Hell no.
I swear.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
Yes?
You made me have an abortion.
I didn't make you. You thought it best.  But, look, I take full responsibility.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Oh dear.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
I know who you are.
Save your breath for the climb.
Siwash, huh?
Easy come, easy go.
Oh, Rupert and Carla had a little hassle and went home.
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Whose fault was that?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
I was a successful model once.
Bonanza Jellybean?
A job for me?
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
You're convinced the crew could still be alive? After seven years?
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Can you shut it down?
"Another man?" Who?
Please... kill...
90 over 50 and falling... .
Does he know that?
Background radiation. Perfectly safe.
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Justin. I won't let you die.
I designed the ship's propulsion system. I am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. You can't send a Search and Rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. That would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
There's no one here, Skipper.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
...you okay?
Fine. Starck, I want you to repeat the bio-scan...
That is not acceptable --
Peters and I will search the forward decks. Justin, take Engineering. No hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
You said this ship creates a gateway...
I don't know...
Just get your gear back onto the Lewis and Clark, doctor, or you'll find yourself looking for a ride home.
I'm not the Devil.
Then what, what are you? Tell me...
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
Locked and cocked.
Dr. Weir...!
That's enough!
What is it, Smith?
I just saw Weir, I think he was messing around on the Clark.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
Okay. Let's find out how much time we just bought.
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
I didn't say that, I said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
I know that.
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's been past Mars?
Wasn't that ship destroyed?
DJ!  It's okay. You're okay. Just breathe.
Blood. Looks like arterial spray.
There's no one here.
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Hey! You don't need to be a scientist figure it out...
Picking up magnetic interference.
I can't believe we built this.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
It wants me. I have to go.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
I'm blind, not deaf. Wanna come in?
Well why didn't you say so? You want me to lift some weights or something?
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
Where do you think? With Sue.
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
I already got it. Everything I want.
Youthful high spirits.
Victor's better at these things.
Yeah, nine years straight.
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Got it, teach.
Actually, the engines are SMEs. Hydrogenbase, carbon propellant. Couple generations past your last ride.  I'm not as dumb as you look.
Keep talking, there won't be a next time.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
Johnny.
Is that a trick question? C'mon, I can't be the only one who thinks this is cool.
Girl...?!
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
Look around, sis! She's not here. So you can stop talking to me like I'm your little boy --
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Yes sir. You've got the Mayor at eight, then a nine-thirty interview with the Journal --
I was talking about us. Working together.
We need to get past them.
If it happened to him, then it could...
What in the world would give me that idea?
I did. I did, Reed... but I wanted you to be that man.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose. And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
Not at all.
Not much. We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Victor, if we could understand what happened to us --
What I should have done a long time ago. Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
I think you both know my Director of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.
Sue, I've lived my life unafraid of taking big steps. And this is the biggest step yet. If it helps, think of this as a promotion. A merger of sorts...  Four little words that can change our lives...
Susan. What are you doing?
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
Of course.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
If you'd apologize I think Dennis would take you back.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Hey-yo.
I take out the garbage.
You're fired.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Sure. Come on in.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I didn't see you this morning.
Doesn't sound free to me.  So you want me to pay for it?
Get going.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Yeah?
Damone. It's Mark.
Mark. What happened to your date?
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Okay. See ya.
Fine. Get lost.
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
How often do you go?
Suzanne Somers' tits.
Just be glad you're all right.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
Should we buy a frame for that?
He was hot, wasn't he?
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
You'll always remember your first time.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
What's Doug do in Chicago?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
What?
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here.  As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
Yes.
Sure thing.
Yeah. It's my sister's.
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Not for me.
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
A major!
Really?
You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum.
I know. I'm a triple Scorpio.
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
Damn right!
You whore!
Lacerda?
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
I dig my own graves. Green water and the White Rabbit. Put it on.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
No, she's looking for you.
Extract of pineal!
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
No! I swear I'm not!
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
They'll be back.
Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
Yeah.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
C'mon guys--
If we move in a group, we are one target. If we scatter, they CAN'T get us all.
Follow me.
Go douche.
Look, yeah, he's an ass, but he's my brother. Que sera-sera.
What?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
Gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
I can't feel a thing, Hon.
What?
Nothing.
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Is it gassed up?
Max?
Let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
No bullshit.
What?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Amazing you made it this far.
HELLLPPP!
Right. Were going to need some fire power.  Do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? Anything at all?
Um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
Well...
Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here. She wants to talk to you, help you out.
Come on, she's an important columnist! What's the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
That's right. You're an actress, Miss Farmer and your job is to act.
I'm not!
Well... well, you see, that's the point. You won't be opening in London.
I know, but --
In my eyes, officer.
GET OUT!
Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
...Yes.
Without me.
I gotta go now.
I know you believe that.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
No.
No. Never.
He's a socialist, then?
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Why, you... you little bastard!
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Whattaya mean?
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Quietly.
Yeah.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free.  I thought we might go skinny dipping.  For starters.
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Eight stories.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Forget it.
The chauffeur. He's watching.
I took the early rounds.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
Huh?
What's that?
You give up on her?
I love you too, Frances.
Just a little way.
Yeah, I know what that's like... Where you been?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
Fine!
But I want to. I'm trying!
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I don't care.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
I'm going out!
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Frances, you're still filled with anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. Consequently, I didn't recommend your release at the staff review.
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
I'm not sure I believe. But then I had no one to instruct me. I had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
I will not! Kill me now!
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
The world is a dizzying place.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Why the change? What about your work?
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Open this door for no-one!
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
It's a letter to my father.
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
We catch a few hours sleep where we can. Usually here at your bedside.
Thank you, Henry.
I owe you that. Done.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
Oh, now you have gone too far. There's only one God, Victor.
You'd persist at the cost of your own life? The lives of your crew?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
I don't know. Marcie's got me paranoid.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
I guess...
Good night, Brenda.
I don't know.
Marcie?
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Oh, you...
No, they won't...
I need you so much, Claudette.
Here we go.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Ha! You wily oriental! The phone was "Mr. Watson, come in here, I need you." "What hath God wrought" was the telegraph.
I guess...
Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
I got to.
One night on the town.
I mean...
I meant me, my son and my daughter.
I'm gonna try and get us across the border.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Jacob.
He's my son.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Scott and Kate.
Yes, they do.
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
He backed down.
In the Winnebago.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Okay, I'll buy that. So we got crosses covered, moving right along, what else?
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
If it doesn't have a pool, we're looking for a new place.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
The Sword of Damocles is lifted from above Seth's head. He's just solved a problem that a mere thirty seconds ago seemed unsolvable. He knows exactly how he's going to cross the border. Whistling a happy tune, he turns and walks back into room #9.
Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a chance you'd feed us to them!
-- you got your sink --
Knock yourself out.
Letting him use your toilet? No store does that.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
How ya think, it hurts like a son-of- a-bitch.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
-- This conversation is over.
Didya look at the border?
They're going to apprehend us in forty-eight hours.
How do you know?
What?
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
What does that mean?
Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a fuckin' nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its tracks.
Or what?
Yep. We're heading for the rendezvous right now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin' back. How ya like them apples?
What do you mean?
Where are you?
My shit is together.
Scarred for life, that's how I am!
Okay, I'll have one.
Yeah, it's mine.
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane."  See what you can find.
Thank you, sir.
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular.
Permission to evaporate, O'Neil.
Entering my scan now...
O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
I wanted the choice.  The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me.  That's how it should've been.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
You'll try what we tell you to try, O'Neil.  Go regulation.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
Which is guy-speak for...
Well, now I feel so much better.
Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me...
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
Smoke it!
I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer.  Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders.
"Dad."
The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women --
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Thought you two were file-closed.
Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew.
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
Don't for a second think she didn't leak this story.  "G.I. Jane" gives DeHaven a symbol that taps into the biggest constituency of them all.
I don't know.  Seems...
I take it this file is still open.
This is what you get for brain- picking an old CIA spook.  but if I needed to control the outcome of this test case, that's how I'd do it.  A man-in-place.  Makes everything very controllable.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
Yeah. Why are you asking?
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Only one way to find out.
Oh yes he will.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time. Yeah, I guess I'm still a little mad.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Can I use some?
What?
Oh, thank you.  Is she always like this?
Allez, allez!
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
And how should we do that, Sir?
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
What do we know? It was first sighted off the French Polynesian Pacific. An area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
Thanks.
This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
Good idea.
Where are you?
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Wait.  Au revoir.
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
...Damn you!  Damn you!
KEEP GOING! KEEP GOING!
I heard something. A squeal.
No. I can't go out there! I won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. I won't.  I can't!
The engines are dead. We're drifting.
The guy is terminally selfish!
Nobody was WATCHING?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Okay...  Okay, now what.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Okay, now. But-
Yes?
It's fractured...
We need another one.
... What does that mean?
OK!
It's suicide.
We should have a turbo. I'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
It's a rough plan, Guy! What does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
Hey, YOU want to drive?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
Ninty-nine percent of ACTING is commitment. ACTING.  Stella Adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught ACTING...
Jason..
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
Almost as much as he loves himself.
Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
Closer?  I can try.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
I... certainly, but-
Sections of rooms made of plywood. Our Beryllium Sphere was painted wire and plaster. The digital conveyor was Christmas lights... Decorations.  It's all a fake.  I'm not him...  I'm a nothing. A nobody.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Okay, let's go.
Pedal to the metal...
Mark 20 Into the black hole,  areao.
What does she see in them?
You seem pleased by the prospect.
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
No, my lord.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
Marquis!  Get these men reformed, send Steuben and Wayne out on the left...
We better, Congress invented him.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
Congress has informed the army that it is bankrupt and cannot pay the soldiers pensions.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
But it's more than just that, am I right?
Lafayette is my friend!  He believes in glory and truth and the freedom of all mankind; so, of course he's a child.  But he would have died before he would have let me down.
They are... friends of Congress.
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
But, general, I assure you my motives are sincere.
I... they look both the same.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
And how rusty are these muskets?
Get these men back in line!
My God, these people mean to go to war!  They really mean it.
Of course, if it were that simple.  These people?  They're after something else...
I think I heard that.
Oh, indeed?  You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes!  They beg you to consider the future.  What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
I want you to see our hospital.
Yessir!
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
Yes, but I've spent the last winter studying all the great battles of history.  And I read the lives of Caesar, Alexander, Hannibal...  Sir, I'm volunteering you the wholehearted support of the Rhode Island army.
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
I remember a pair of young philosophers once, who laughed at the world.
That's not what I said!  Now, Sally, you're embarrassing me!  Watch out for her, George; she talks refinement, but she has a barbarous soul!
Slavers capture them and bring them here.
It's stupid, of course.
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
I see...
God damn you, Sam Adams!  You wanted a revolutionary army and now that we've really got one it scares you more than it does the British!
So where's the money?
You guess? You mean you don't know?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
You're right.
I have to ask you for that key.
I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
About sixty.
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
You positive about that?
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
By Friday, man, or you're fuckin' dead as disco.
Who?
Look at me, Ray.
I like it here.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Hey, fuckball, I don't need your permission. L.A.'s an open city.
Something shouldn't be there.
Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
They don't want to deposit yours and have it bounce. That annoys them. So your dear friend Dick Allen's been calling, leaving messages on your machine, but you never get back to him. I happen to be in Vegas on another matter, and Dick asks me as a favor would I look you up. I follow you over here, see you in the window with this woman, looks a lot like that actress Karen Flores, was in Grotesque, except she's not blond anymore...
Karen, it's a pleasure. How you doing?
You mean, Leo?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
I've been picked up a couple times. Loan sharking. Racketeering. But I was never convicted. I'm clean.
A blockbuster. But quality. No mutants or maniacs. This one's gonna be my "Driving Miss Daisy".
"Ride the Clouds". Good picture.
So what's the problem?
Read it. It's a grabber.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Never say anything unless you have to.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
Twenty seven hundred.
Wait. How about this?
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
Buddy?
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
How'd you know I was here?
You see a black leather jacket, fingertip length, like the one Pacino wore in Serpico? You don't, you owe me three seventy-nine.
What're you doing here?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Harry's dreaming of a forty-million- dollar production he'll never get off the ground with a star he'll never sign. With or without my help.
Right. See how your story ends.
Yeah well... I like movies. I figure if I help Harry make one, I'll find out what you have to do outside of have an idea and raise the money. That doesn't sound too hard. I was in the money business and I get ideas all the time.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
Because a movie star can never order straight from the menu. They have to think of something they have to have that isn't on the menu.
I don't know.
In an armchair. Or I go to a coffee shop, sleep there. Sit in a booth, pull my hat down.
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
I'm thinking about producing.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
Come on in.
He said if Martin's interested, I could get a half a million for it easy. But don't worry, Harry, I'm still giving you until Friday.
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
What?
A what?
I heard a scream. When I got there I found him on the floor. He was having some kind of seizure. I didn't see anybody else.
How much longer's that gonna take?
What about running number two by itself?
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Right.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Sudden flashes of light.
Only way to be.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
Are you sure?
It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard.
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Same. Any luck?
What?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Doesn't matter.
Not our mystery guest again.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
So you killed them?
The way I figure it, it was them or me. I thought putting Dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? Bought a little time. Made it look like whoever killed those Greeks was still around. But it's just us on this ship. Us and your... spirit friends.
I don't give a damn about the gold.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
You mean tow her back? That's a thirty thousand ton ship you're talking about.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
We leave it where it is. Stick to the plan.
Not much at all, I guess. Retire. Live out my golden years and all that.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
Doesn't look like it much matters.
Leave it.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You got a leak in the number nine compartment.
Someone from the past.
About what?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Actually, I was just checking to see if you were here - your friend Seymour is on his way up.
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Hi.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Why not?
You're better at it.
What does it stand for?
Totally! Look!
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
What are you talking about?
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Don't worry.
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move.  Aren't these the greatest towels?
How repulsive!
Why? What did he say?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
It just came yesterday...
Shhh!
If you really want to "fuck up the system" - you should go to business school -- that's what I'm gonna do: get a job at some big corporation and fuck things up from the inside!
You don't know what you're talking about.
Tsk! You Jews are so clever with money...
Do you want to see it? I can run upstairs and get it...
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Yeah, well...
I mean as long as she's not a complete imbecile and she's even remotely attractive...
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
Jesus, Seymour.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Hey, I get good benefits, a good early retirement plan, nobody ever bothers me...
Are you okay?
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
That's the spirit!
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Who knows?
It's just somebody's idea of a joke...
Sounds good...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
I had to see you.
What's up?
What's the matter?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Sounds like a healthy way to deal with your problems.
What do you want?
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
Yeah, well... thanks for cheering me up.
I am.
It's my response to the issue of a woman's right to choose... it's something I feel super-strongly about.
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
That slut!
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
There is no reason for fear.
On that I choose to remain dubious.  Two are dead now in two nights. 
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
-at last you're right- we do- you are the problem in Tsavo-
I think it's been a pleasure.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
How could it be? I hate Africa.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
Yes he is.
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
That is correct.  Nothing.
I assure you we came close many times-
Almost three hours.  But I've been getting ready all my life. 
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Good news?
Four should do it.
Oh no.
Certainly.
You're also a human being, Frank.
You know, Dana, I'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  I'm still into all this stuff, you know.  Haven't you ever seen my show?
His name is Oscar.
I'll supervise.
I'm El Gato.  I always land on my feet.
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
I'm not here to date.  I can't leave Oscar in a strange place with someone I don't know.
Does she know anything about babies?
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
Look, you stay away from the mayor.  Next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  You read me?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
You're right.  We should stay.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
The Upper West Side.
-- the sorrow --
I await the word of Vigo.
Your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  I don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  Okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  I was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and I had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but I don't blame them because once I turned into a dog and they helped me.  Thank you.
Did I forget something?
I can't do it, Louis.  It isn't ethical.  I could lose my license.
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
No, the slime is rising.
Who, Ray?
Dana!  Dana Barrett!
I'm Peter --
I guess so, Pete, because that's not all. Tell them what else we've got, Egon.
What kind of tests?
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Yeah, sorry I missed it.  I guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  It's really kind of a coat and tie place.
It's okay.  I have my Senior Lifesaving card.
I didn't break your precious clock, Roy!
Uuuuuuugh!!
It's in the stars.
Spengler,  see if you can find the word "Zuul" in any of the literature.  I'll take Miss Barrett home and check out her apartment.
Thanks.  What's in there?
I'll wait here if you don't mind.
Are you all right?
I think I should spend the night here.
On a purely scientific basis.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I want you inside me.
There is no Dana.  I am Zuul.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
In the physical sense.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
I'm not at liberty to say.
And may I see this storage facility?
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Gozer.
Full-stream with strogon pulse.
We'd better adjust our streams.
The storage facility blew.  This one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
Fourteen hundred.
Well, that ought to do it.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
We're nearly there, Lucilla.
Will you please get back in your wagon?  And stay there?
For the gods, spit it out!
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
What are you talking about?
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Of course, but not now.  However, if he continues to be unwell, you may report to me.
Ignore that?!  The sooner we leave this disgusting place the better.
I'm serious.
Give away food?
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
I'll nose around...
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
But have never been?
We all know what right is, Senator.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
Why you?
They can't... if this is Rome...
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Yours will do!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
The Senators admire you.
As soon as I can.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Let him trust Quintus.
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
You teach them!
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Such nobility from such an ignoble mouth.  Take my advice and make that bet.
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Then get a large cash advance.
Are you going to graduate school?
Why not?
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.
But could you try?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
With a family?
You do?
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
How could you do that, Benjamin?
If you want.
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
I don't know.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Oh no. He said that.
What are you then?
Who screamed?
Could I make one phone call first?
Well here's the purse.
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
Will you take me home?
But it's light in there now.
Please wait till my husband gets home.
Yes.
Look -- I think I should be going --
All right. Now finish your drink.
What is wrong with me?
Yes.
Very much.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
I've got to go.
Why don't you get it.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Thank you.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes?
Is this -- what?
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Neither.
I don't.
Yes I do.
What?
Always?
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
What?
How many times a year.
But you don't hate him.
I don't.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.
That's enough.
Because I don't want you to.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Are you?
If that's how you feel --
But if it's sickening for you --
Thank you.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
Goodnight, sir.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
No wait. Wait.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
You believe me, don't you?
No -- they don't.
I guess -- about my future.
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
I know.
Oh yes.
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
Yes?
Benjamin Braddock.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
And what are you going to do?
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Oh -- work!!
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
Too bad.
What?
Free --
Yes -- I'd love to.
What do you want here?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Just for a minute then.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
What?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Really?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
That's a silly joke.
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night. 
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
I thought she was splendid!
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
I must have made a mistake.
Be quiet.
And the child isn't coming?
Most imposters are --
You're tired. I can see that.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
You don't understand that do you?
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Not too quickly.
You're a little too fast.
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
No -- now.
A thousand marks -- 
Baron!
Here, hold up!
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
I mean with the Manchester people?
Of course you took the initiative.
You've decided against the merger?
Yes --
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov? 
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
Last night?... There was no applause.
Please.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Come, Lisaveta, he will be there -- he will be there.
No news yet?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on... 
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
What do you want with her?
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Hah.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything.  Wouldn't I, darling?
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
It's not your fault.
Hello.
Roy Dillon.
That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I let people get away with things like that, I wouldn't be a good salesman.
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
But you need a man right now. It wouldn't be fair to you to --
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks.  Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
Don't mention it.
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
Why?
Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the weekend.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
And Myra's stuff?
No.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Are you sure?
Mm?
Look at me.
Roy? It this all we have?
Mama!
Because it's comfortable.
Myra, I'm not following this.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
And a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you're on the run.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning hits. I don't want to be around when it hits you.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
You up to it now?
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
That don't match either of the victim's.
I can be real stiff.
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
Okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
Don't think so.  But they sure did a real number on your office. Crap everywhere.
You're so predictable.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Okay, you win.  I'll call you Mom. Now can I move into the dorms?
I know.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
No.
Why didn't you tell me?
That would work.
Okay... thank you.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
The tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
Doesn't make it bad advice.
What?
What are you looking at?
The serial killer?
Shit happens.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Can't you?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
No one's coming to get you.  Not while I'm around.
Kids are what's ruining this country. Everywhere you go, it's the same.  No goddamn respect.
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
It's ... Michael ... Michael Myers!
I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Here.  Let me try.
Kara, no!
It's not working!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
That's what someone wants us to believe, but I tell you Michael is alive.  I feel him.  I sense the evil that lives inside, just as I did all those years as I watched him.  Sitting behind these very same walls.  Staring. Growing stronger.  As my colleague, as my friend, please. I can't go through this again.  Not alone.  I need your help to stop him.
Or what's left of him.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
It was you.
Jamie's baby ...
And I'm its deliverer.  Its calling card, if you will.  I follow it.  Protect it. Act as its guardian.  In a sense, Sam, so do you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
A bitch.
At least!
It's enough that you've brought yourself home!
You don't know my mother-in-law, boy.
Go home!
So long, Colonel.
Go home!
You ever own a motorcycle?
You told me.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
I didn't know we had any women left.
It helped more than you know.  Down deep, people were deeply affected.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
I just want one true adventure before I die.
For Africa.
You invited me.
You're my buddy.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Are you--
Are you--do you--
Do you know who Wanda June is?
It makes life spicy.
Nothing.  He plays a violin in a doctors' quartet.
Dad was never in England?
Hid by day--fought by night.  At sunset one day, your father and I, peering through field glasses, saw a black Mercedes draw up to a village inn.  It was escorted by two motorcyclists and an armored car.  Out of the Mercedes stepped one of the most hateful men in all of history--the Beast of Yugoslavia.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Sir?
She was killed in the park two months ago--in the daytime.
Can I get dressed first?
Yeah.  But it's going to get loud again.
This is crazy.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
I could carve a better man out of a banana!
I'm not about to introduce to you a jungle novelty.  What I have in mind is massage--a perfectly decent massage.  Turn around, turn around.
I have a brain.
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
I will not be scrogged.  I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
Fish can't feel.
The doctor.
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD  Goodbye.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
Did you like it, dear?
Two hundred years old.
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Blue soup?
Ah!  The lady is armed.
I mean it!
Seventeen of them--eleven by accident.  March!  Move!  You, too!
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Gentlemen--that's nice.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
We tried to be.  We tried to be.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
I know malaria.  Malaria isn't caused by the bites of bats.
I've never heard of it.
There's a certain amount of information there.
Lest we forget how cruel you are.
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Correct.
You haven't heard me yet.
You intend to crack my eardrums with your voice?  Will I bleed from my every orifice?  Who will clean up this awful mess?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I hate crowds, and I have no charisma--
No.
It's trash now, like mine.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
What are you going to do?
Leave the rifle here.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
For what it's worth now, Harold Ryan, the clown, gives his sacred word.
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Ja?
You bet I'll worry about it.  I said something wrong?
Don't!
Explain it to them.  I'm bugging out of here.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
I don't really know.
Then who flushed the toilet?
He can hardly talk.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
That's something I suppose.
I'm glad.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
For Harold.  When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up.  It says, "Happy Birthday, Somebody Else."
What was it?
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
The what?
Meaning?
No.  But he's going to be.  If he is in the park and he comes out safely on the other side, I can say to him, "You and I are the only men with balls enough to walk through the park at midnight."  On that we can build.
He'd go to a movie.  I think that's what he'd do.  If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying.  We could have him paged.
I believe in miracles now.
Or get eaten alive.
Chinese maniacs and Russian maniacs and American maniacs and French maniacs and British maniacs have turned this lovely, moist, nourishing blue-green ball into a doomsday device.  Let a radar set and a computer mistake a hawk or a meteor for a missile, and that's the end of mankind.
If he'd just come out for the Little League, the way I asked him, he'd find out we touch all the time--shove each other, slug each other, and just horse around.  I'm going to go get him--
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
We have enough for a shuffleboard team.  In Heaven, shuffleboard is everything.  Hitler plays shuffleboard.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
Big threat. TV would ream you.
What do you mean?
I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
That's cool.
Just one.
Okay.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
You know her?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Ulcers.
No.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
He deals in pain.
It's not quite the same thing.
Where does he live.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
You are.
I suppose. But I'll tell you, Jake, I'm like a little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If your daughter's here, I'll track her down.
Get out.
Does she know anything about this?
Wes, Anne, come here a moment.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
I know. Word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
Um-hm. You got the five hundred?
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Who?
What we got is just these here.  What you see.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
In other words, you want to get laid?
I thought you were a businessman.
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
The guy who bought you that ring.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself, honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait. Could get you in a lotta trouble.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Was he with a girl?
Yes, I am.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Oh, I don't have one.
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
No, no. I just took it.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
How interesting.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
All right.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Yes. Very much.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
Yes.
Thank you.
Superb.
Yes.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
I took them out.
Oh, Harold. 
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
To a girl. Here.
Perhaps it is.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
Ah, yes.
What about the draft?
I don't know.
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
Thank you, Uncle.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Harold!
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Eh, yes, ma'm.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Yes!
What's the matter with her?
What?
The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
The boxes! I TOLD you.
Who?
No, listen this: Sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of Nergal --
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
Got tired of me?
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His what??!!
Noooo! Noooo!!!
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
You call that thing a cigar??
On a scale of one to ten: two. But --  -- she'll take care of you, Myers. She's a tough one.
I've changed my mind. I'll come to Moscow. If you -- are still going --
Red, I --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Strong.
Yes, I --
Two steps back, please.
My fucking hand!
Where's my father?
Sure.
Her mother's dead.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
Oh Christ.
Some things have to be endured...
But you said --
Forget him.
I'm very happy.
Good.
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
Not know.
Let me see.
I was bored. I'd done everything. I'd gone to the limits. There was nothing left to experience. At least nothing I could buy on earth.
I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Hi. I got soaked.
Just an accident. He's all right. Will you drive? He needs stitches.
I was here this afternoon.
Ah!
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
Shit.
Let me see.
Please. I can't bear it...
Drinking alone.
You want something to drink?
I... suppose so, yes.
No.
Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
What did you say?
Do you want me to come over?
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Well come over, will you? See the place?
I don't know. I don't know. It's beyond me.
Sure.
No. You don't understand. Your brother -- Frank -- he's here in the house. And he's --
Finished?
Yes!
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
It's late.
What things?
I won't let anybody take you.
Sure. Why not?
You gotta be kidding me.
But it's my new tape.  My Monday morning tape.  I made it last night just for today.
Great.  That's the fun of working in a record store.  Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to.  I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence.  That I was going to see it?
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Of course I'm not coming.  Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave?  Where is it?  The fucking Bucktown Pub?  Ha!
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
So?  You even said they're good.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
What are you talking about?
Is there a difference?
Nice friend.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Great.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
I understand, Dick.
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Who's that?
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob.  We're talking actionable harassment.  Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
-- Made.  Made.  Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
No.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
I don't know.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Nothing.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
Those aren't mine.
Okay, okay.  I get the picture.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Hi.  What are you doing?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
WHAT?
That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
You called this morning?
Yeah.  I just wanted to thank you for that message last night.  It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
It's a crematorium.
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
It's a great song.
Well call her mother.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Fine.
Sure.  Ten cents.
No, we...
Records are those big round black things, right?
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Nice.
How old is Richard?
Sure.
The boy _died_?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
It's quite rare you know, some- thing so common in its time so well looked after all these years.
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
That bothers you?
You?
You're a fool.
Our cars were seen together in Felton.  They're calling me an accessory to murder.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
I wish I could.
A little dusty.
That would be difficult to explain.
What about that family in '31?
What is it you want?
I'm just curious.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
You're an asshole, Moran.
He's too cool.  Too sharp.  I think he's got something to do with it.
Give it a rest Ned, huh?
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
First food, no?  A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You are the same?
Yes.  Always.
We are brothers.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
Then they were right.  I am evil. This is God's punishment.
But we cannot be killed.
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But I did live.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
Kiss me.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Mulet.
What is your position?
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Equals?
And the Bulgarian?
Sit.
Good times then.  A man could stretch his legs without bring- ing half the world down around his ears.  Not like now.
No, seriously.  We used to shoot pool together in Rangoon.
I've had a few more concerns.
Of sorts.
Did you know the victim?
It was covered with Mr. Fasil's fingerprints, but none of his blood.
Do you?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
What's the idea of locking this?
Hello, Bensinger.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
No. Roy. Roy V.
Sort of a Jack London style?
Exactly!
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Where'd she go?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Gee! Take a look, will you?
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
Do you want to get us scooped?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I notice you still remember it.
Done what?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
You -- you --
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
You said it.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
What do you mean?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes. Where is he?
I know. Where is he, I said.
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Where's Butch?
What tickets?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Walter!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
You're not fooling anybody.
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
You got plenty of money?
Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though.
I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
Good coffee, isn't it?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
I was just going to!
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
My name is Louis Peluso.
Phone for you, Hildy.
Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
First you got to sign a receipt. 
Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here.  One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign.
I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was.
What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did!
That man there!
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
Shut up, you!
What's from the Governor?
How much do you make a week?
I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
No, I don't think so.
No, it doesn't.  Now, remember: you never delivered this.  You got caught in the traffic, or something.  Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
I have to live in Rosehill Avenue as well.
Looking for shrapnel.
Who told you that?
Do you know any swear words?
Say them.
Bloody.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
Well, for the baby, really.
That's it. When you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. When someone else does, you want to find them out. A good batsman will spot a googly. A good bowler will hide it. Always remember that, son.
Please yourself.
Thanks. I hope you can come for the launching.
Why not?
I will if you will!
Don't bother to grow up. It's no fun at all.
You taste it.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
A Polish pilot. It's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Yeah, most people just whiz on by like I was invisible or something... or else they're creeps who wanna jam their slimy hands down my pants and twiddle my naughty-naughty.
Where's that?
You're welcome.
The animals have got nothing to do with it.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Ummmm... two hundred and eighty-five dollars.
A missing girl. I use'ta go to school with her, she just up and disappeared some day... real weird.
How long is a piece of string? Too God damn long, that's how long.
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Shit, we really need to find some gas.
Perfect.
Cat fight, cat fight.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
What!
Fine! I'll go straight!
Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
That kid is one horny retard.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Oh.
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Tickets for what?
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
So what?
No please, let me sit this one out.
Aw, shit...  I gotta pee anyway.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
I know, that was some crazy shit. I never in a million years would have believed it if I hadn't seen it.
You got to be fucking joking.
What? I didn't hear anything.
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Yeah, no mercy here.
Keys.
Open up the trunk.
I'll bet you are... you are a naughty little thing aren't ya.
You didn't see the look she threw me. She's up to something.
You, my dear worm feeder, are about to become immortalized.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before...  ...he looks familiar, is he on TV?
What! God damn, how many?
Well, go get her.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
My Denise is a smart girl, she wouldn't do anything stupid, and her boyfriend, he always seemed like a good kid.
Right.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Excuse me for a second.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
It's going famously, son, famously!
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Not at all.
Of course not.
Oui.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
Hmmmph.
Gabby, what is it?
Please. I look a mess.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes!
No.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Shut up and tell me.
No. I married a midget.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Lila, it's Rosie.
With pleasure.
You look wonderful. I'm on top of the world tonight, Lila. Work is going splendidly and my personal life is ...
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Yes.  Please don't talk with food in your mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty and it only mars your... I'm sorry. I'm being critical.
Why certainly!
Of course.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
Yes, darling.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
So he's doing okay?
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Tomorrow, the acid test.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Got it.
Down from the tree. Both of you. Keep your hands where I can see them. Don't want you pulling any weapons out of your fur.
Let's be reasonable human beings here. We're all reasonable human beings, aren't we?
I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila.
Yes?
Mm hmm.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
And a fact is a fact.
For whom and for what?
That's the way it's done.
What did he say?
I lost twenty bucks.
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Man named Turk Baker?
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How much?
They're fine.
I got time, Bert.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Fast and loose, man.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
Would you like to come out tonight?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Okay, friend.
Shoot.
Since four.
Yours.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
I'm not.
I drink.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Give me a drag.
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, I forgot.
You want to go with me?
You got it all in your head?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
No. You?
What's it so hot in here for?
A loser?
For how long?
Leave now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Twelve. Cross side.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
You lived like this once.
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers.  Now I... remember.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
Why, Dad?
Okay.
You've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
Was there anything over the hill?
You don't have to.  The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
I don't have many friends.  Dad's all the time moving.
Yes.
What would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  I saw them.
No, but it was here.
Let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What happened to your other slipper?
It's really nice of you to help us.
You're being paranoid.
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Then get them out of there.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
Haven't you been watching?
Just do it!
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
Dad, don't start.
Can't this thing go any faster?
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
You think an important person like Constance is going to be listed?
A cold? Of course.
You as well.
I don't hear no fat lady.
I had a feeling you would.
And there are scattered reports of sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth, And Memphis.
Better than we thought.
Then find them.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
Was his father stationed here?
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
That'd be cool!
So far these things have not become hostile. For the moment let's assume they won't.  Connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
There is no museum in Iskenderun.
Do you believe, Marcus?
Dad was onto something here!
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Schneider?
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
An old man's dream.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
What?
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
No. You like the way I do things.
All I have to do is scream.
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
But what are you doing here?
Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
Well, what was left of him.
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Yeah?
Look, can we discuss this later?
Head for the fireplace!
Brody's this way.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
I was the next man.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Dad, we're well out of range.
Penitent. Penitent...
No camels!
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
It's like the voodoo dolls of West Africa. The kryta represents your enemy -- and gives you complete power over him.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
Finally!
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
Well, I don't know... we came here from a small village and the peasants there told us that the Pankot Palace was growing powerful again -- because of some ancient evil.
Maybe... but how do you explain The Thuggee shrine I saw right below the palace?
Nee chin lie how ma?
It's just superstition, Shorty. Like a ghost story.
Why they glow like that?
No. Now there is new Maharajah -- and palace is powerful again.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
What evil?
Who cares? Where's that diamond!
The airport... No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
No... I'm not cut out for the kind of life you lead.  Oh no... I ripped my dress. Where are we anyway?
He said that's whey they were at river -- they were waiting for the plane to fall down.
It's pulling me deeper!
PET IT??!!
It's Sanskrit. It tells the story of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa where he met the Hindu god Shiva.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
Just try and control yourself.
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
I am -- it looks horrible!
What's going on?
Where are we?
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
What for?
Hear voices don't I.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
You gotta help.
I'm not leaving until you do.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
Gone where?
We get on a plane.
What about it?
Why not?
It's attitude...how you carry yourself.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
It's sand.
She doesn't seem to understand.
What?
What?
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Yeah. I did it.
It is my business. It's my name.
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just hold them close and stay still.
I don't know what's going on.
Don't get too cute.
Come on...look at her. Don't you know anything about women?... The data is skewed. We might as well go with instinct...
You can't listen. You can't watch either.
You shut down your sensors.
Is that all?
You found her.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. I don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. I don't even know where I am. What's going to present itse........
Follow her.
On what?
Relax. Let me do this.
I know she's not with them. I know something else. What's bothering you isn't her.
Too late.
Drink lots of water.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
I don't know.
Never mind that, where are we now.
Gimme a minute.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
Now, you're too suspicious.
You've changed your mind.
I want to thank you for what you've done.
I'll get us out of here.
Don't worry about me. You take this time for your own, you two.....
Works like a charm when I use it. You didn't say it right.
The best part. She'll love it.
Newer, more powerful design.
That crazy guy?
Yes. Joe.
When you do...
Do what?
When you remember...
Thanks.
Here?
Home. Your home. The address on your form.
No, it wasn't, It was intentional.
I don't know Who.
Sir?
What did you say?
What?
No. No one to speak of.
Yes, of course.
I just work for the travel firm.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
Hires you for what?
What do you mean?
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
Get your things.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
You think I'm like that?
They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
How?
Get us one.
What?
I was...crazy...desperate. I took it out on you. I didn't mean it. I know what she sees in you. You're kind and you're brave. If I ever get out of you, I'll be glad to call you my friend.
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
If he was able, what would he say.
We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
It will.
No?
So we better get started.
What about Al...
What? Forget it.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Okay.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
I don't know what he was thinking.
The sub-heading is, "Brown & Williamson Has a 500-Page Dossier Attacking Chief Critic." It quotes Richard Scruggs calling it "the worst kind of an organized smear campaign against a whistle-blower."
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
CBS does not do that. And, you're questioning our journalistic integrity?!
I am? You pay me to go get guys like Wigand, to draw him out. To get him to trust us, to get him to go on television. I do. I deliver him. He sits. He talks. He violates his own fucking confidentiality agreement. And he's only the key witness in the biggest public health reform issue, maybe the biggest, most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case in U.S. history. And Jeffrey Wigand, who's out on a limb, does he go on television and tell the truth? Yes. Is it newsworthy? Yes. Are we gonna air it? Of course not. Why? Because he's not telling the truth? No. Because he is telling the truth. That's why we're not going to air it. And the more truth he tells, the worse it gets!
No, you fucked you! Don't invert stuff! Big Tobacco tried to smear Wigand; you bought it. The Wall Street Journal, here, not exactly a bastion of anti-capitalist sentiment, refutes Big Tobacco's smear campaign as the lowest form of character assassination! And now, even now, when every word of what Wigand has said on our show is printed, the entire deposition of his testimony in a court of law in the State of Mississippi, the cat totally out of the bag, you're still standing here debating! Don, what the hell else... do you need?
Yes, I'm afraid I did.
What caliber is my gun?
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
You alright, Mr. Wigand?
How grave?
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Come again?
Call me back in ten.
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
No.  I'm assuming the cave-in begins with the threat of litigation from Big Tobacco. Are we talking... are we talking Brown & Williamson, here?
What do you need at the store?
Why? Who said?
Use the bathroom.
Can we talk about this when I get back?
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
What are you and Mike going to do?
...you fucked me!
I'll call you then.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
What's this?
What do you mean?
Yeah, well, questions will go toward what work you did there, why you were fired. And others will deal...
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
Oh, lots.
Yeah... Thank you.
How did a radical journalist from Ramparts Magazine end up at CBS?
Did work.
If you want to do it.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
They should be.
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
It's okay.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
What?!
She sued you for back payments of child support?
I told the truth... I told the truth.
You fought for me...?!  ...you manipulated me... into where I am now... staring at the Brown & Williamson Building. It's all dark. Except the 10th floor! That's the legal department. That's where they fuck with my life!
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
No, no. Don't call the police!  Just tell him I'm on the phone with you... My name is Lowell Bergman... Just tell him that.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
No, you can.  Tell him to get on the fucking phone!
She's okay.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
...I believe Mr. Sandefur perjured himself because I watched those testimonies very carefully.
You're gonna get your fix...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Chapter and verse.
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
I had no idea until after, but --
-- and we are sure...
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
I don't need it.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
We did not.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
What?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
What?
It's your move, Miles.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
How do you know?
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
Gotcha.
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
No, we're not!
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
Fabric and fringe.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just...  SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
You have to leave the house immediately!
It's okay Joe.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Wow.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
I want to be exposed.
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
She always looked out for me.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
No. He's been trailed twenty-four hours a day since this thing started. He can't even get a phone call we don't know about.
Come in. Sit down.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
Yes!  But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
South America.
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
Oh, hello, Dad.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him. 
Are you going to see him?
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today.
You talk as if
Sock her!
I haven't the slightest idea.
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
The papers! The papers! Whadda you mean throwin' 'em out!
Hey, whadda you tryin' to dokid me?
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Driver!
No. I'd rather you didn't.
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's right. You didn't.
That's none of your business.
Smart aleck!
You've got a name, haven't you?
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Try me.
Hayin my teeth.
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You! Don't make me laugh.
We don't need forty cars.
Come on! come on! 
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
What'd you give him for the car?
Why not?
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Come here, you little fool!
Do you know?
Not interested. 
Left twenty minutes ago.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
Get out!
Yes?
What time is it?
Thanks.
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Great!  But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarnthen something comes alongmesses up the finishand there you are.
Yeah.
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Collect.
Oh!!
Better start gettin' into your clothes.
What's the idea?
Why?
What's on your mind?
Whyno
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Orange, New Jersey.
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley?
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
Does that bother you, Bill?  I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.
The murder of a President, Bill, is a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Well, they offered you the carrot, and you turned it down... you know what's coming next, don't you, boss?
Jesus, they must've been hard pressed to come up with that one.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved?  The President of the United States?
Well, I wanted to make sure she's the same girl I sent.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet you in 20 minutes.
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
I don't have much time.  They don't even need bugs anymore.  They got these fuckin' satellite waves.  They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born, right up his nostrils, subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi rocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother.  You'd never believe half the shit the Agency does.  I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept since that shit article came out. Why'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this?
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
I hadn't been there ice skating in many years, and I had a couple of young friends with me, and we decided we wanted to go ice skating.
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Would you say this "Leon" was actually Lee Harvey Oswald?
No.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.
That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill. We have the man that killed the President.
I want the truth.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians.  He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Goddamn!  They put Oswald together from Day One!  Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board.  Sent him to Russia, in and out, no passport problems.  You got the word "microdots" in his notebook, you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions, the sealed DIZ201 personnel file. For all we know, there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities, countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination.  Does the real Oswald know he's been put together?  Who knows.  It doesn't matter, does it?  He's a low level spy, he doesn't know who he really works for...
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up I'll show you how Saturday night got invented.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop readin' them.
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you.  You've changed.
The Office of Naval Intelligence.
What are you driving at, boss?
I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three more lectures this month.  You're all doing an incredible job, Sue, Al, Numa.  But this is one where if you don't nail the other guy, you're dead.  How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of what?  Cancer, right?  A history of Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30's.  We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis.  Read this. Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located.  Think about it.  Think the unthinkable - question everything.
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Does it matter?  Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You know how I know?  That picture of yours.  The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
I don't know if I should talk about this.
You're so naive, mister.
I just don't want to do it.  What else?
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. Garrison, but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to back up what I say.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
That's all you've had all this time?
Virginia or Elizabeth?
Yes.
I understand.
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I ain't doin' you no way. I just ain't climbin' in that trunk. I got a problem with small places.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Arrest me.
What's her name?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
I am. Have a seat.
It looks nice.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
How'd you find that out?
Has he hinted around?
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that?
It's been a long time coming. I finally made up my mind -- I guess it was Thursday.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Not after they're dead.
I didn't say you did.
We're partners.
Thank you for saying that, but no. My business.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Who's side are you on?
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Not yet.
I'm sure that was the idea.
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Uh-huh.
Yes. All those things are true.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
There was a guy with Melanie?
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
What about you?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him.  I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Damn, Jackie, I was just playin' with you.
I understand woman, damn!
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
Talk to you tomorrow.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
She don't know shit about the money.
Designer clothes.
She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on.
Sure.
Four days ago.
Yeah, I'm just gettin' old. I can't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing.
Detroit.
With Ordell?
We had done time together already.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Are you sweating?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Guess where I am?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
You're outside?
Sure.
Yep.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
Why do you let someone know your business you can't trust?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Not now, pick me up.
That's right.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
Yeah.
I know that.
You think you could do that?
On his prior, he served nine months, and he's working on four years' probation.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
I need your name and address.
Now I need you to count your money.
Yes.
It still sounds high.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Beaumont worked for you.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
Mister Robbie, isn't it? I have the ten thousand you put up. Isn't that why you called.
She wants to give you your money. If she didn't, there'd be cops batter- ramming the door right now.
My office.
You better be, motherfucker.
He's around.
Take me home.
Then what are you doing here?
No! The army did this to me! They've done something to my brain.  Jezzie! I want my boys! Sarah! I'm not dead! I want my family!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
It's hard to explain.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
It was the window.
It's cold.
Don't go?  I'm not going anywhere. I'm right here, Gabe.  Come on, go back to sleep. You can still get a couple of hours.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Her knee acting up?
Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office.
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I've seen it. It's all pain.
You can do it. Come on. Easy. Just give it a try.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
Not tonight, Louis. No more rest.
I haven't seen her in months.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
Yes.
Hell, you think I am?
Carlson? Is he new here?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
Who did?
Where are you?
No. The little one.
They're Biblical. They were prophets.
Why you left.
Gabe.
Why? What for?
How high is that?
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Remember that.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
How?
It's so hard to believe.
Please.
Sit down, Jake.
Sit down.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
TELL ME, DAMN YOU!
Then don't bug me.
A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder, on one test battalion. Yours. Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. And you did, too. But not the way they tnought.
The truth can kill, my friend. Five hundred men died out there. This isn't a story they'd ever want out. When Paul's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing. I knew they meant business.
Hey, I'm not the problem. You've got bigger problems than me.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
Total delirium.
Push 'em back.
For what? For seeking the truth?
We're not going to hurt you.
Push 'em back.
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
I don't know what to do.
You come home with me.
Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
We made it?
Rizzo did.
Faster! Don't we have another gun?
Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Negative.
We have to get off this ship.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
You?
That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe.
Just come on, I've got an idea.
NO!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
That ought'a help the situation.
Would you?
Crutch?
I'm just saying.
Kay-em 14.
Barbie from hell...
Good point.
This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way.
No! He's coming with us!
Then open the doors!
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
I didn't say he was alive.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
And incidental damages, if any...
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
C'mon. Middle appendix --
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
I think they make you look sexy.
Martin, we hired the best man we could find.
Sure he is.
Matt Hooper, the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
How can you tell?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
Why don't we just tow it in?
Be careful, for chrissake.
No...  You think we can get back with those?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
You here for the summer?
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Yeah, Charlie, I got my second wind three nibbles back.
Do I set the goddam hook?
Better than Cousteau, or Compagno with computers, telemetry, Defense Department funding...
Yep.
Transplants?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Aye, Aye SIR. Stand by to repel boarders. Poop the mainsail. Argh, Jim Boy.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
You've mentioned it about fifty times.
My mom uses color-safe bleach.
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What a trip, man.
Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
I'm a junior.
No, I mean in your pregnancy.
Well, then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved, then?
Something happened. Because your eyes? Are very cold? They're very cold, Josh. They're cold, lying eyes.
Sorry. I was just getting something.
You weren't even alive!
I don't know. Something to do with the four-packs...  ...They're not bad.
No, he's the dad.
I know what junk is.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready.
You don't have to do that.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Yeah. Mall madness, huh?
Nope. We're safe.
You do?
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
Really? Fingernails?
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Room with a toilet, got it.
I went to the doctor today.
Wow! It's magical.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Just thinking if this is really the right thing for us.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
How'd you meet Early?
...Anything else?
What?
Early, you are so sweet.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
How many times you gonna tell me that?
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Who?
He almost always killed strangers. Spent years moving on from one place to another. That made it real hard to track him down.
Nah... how much money have you got?
What happened to Adele?
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
A book on the warehouse murders?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.'
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Up yours.
Take your time.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
She wasn't feeling so good.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Now you gotta be careful.
She's probably smash you in the fucking face.
Like. Like. Never love. Love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
What for? That guys a dick.
You think he's got any herb?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Can I do it? I just broke her cherry. I imagine I can make her do anything. Bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
Yep.
I mean I've been with a lot of girls I know.
I know what you mean.
Bet.
Shut up.
Casper, where's Telly.
Yo, we might have killed him. You think?
Come on bitch. Throw your fists up.
I like you too.
Bang up stuff.
No...
I wouldn't believe it?
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
Telly is at Steven's. There's a bunch of people over there. Come on dance.
One.
I'm sorry.
But I only had sex with Telly.
Oh it's OK. That's life. Maybe tomorrow I'll win lotto. Who knows? You don't. No one does.
Yeah, I guess so.
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
You didn't?
Mine?
Whah is dissdee?
Yep.
It's like...
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
Yeah. I've always hated that kid. He used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
I hate 'em.
No. I was just kidding.
That's right.
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
Come on Steven hook me up. Do me this solid.  Come on man. I gotta get Darcy alone. She's gonna let me fuck her man. Please.
Homesearchers.
You think he's dirty?
Sanderson?
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
That's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  Really, Peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
Because she's the type.
Pain?  Pain is just a state of mind. It's something you learn to live with. I have.
What word did you leave last night?
The police haven't told you?
I'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  Remember eventually revenge- -
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
It's me you want.  Not her.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
No problem.  We're in.
He's in his seventies and lives in Holland.
I just can't believe it.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
My cheering section.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
I'm a psychologist, Frank... not a psychic.  What's this all about anyway?
What about the way he arranged the body?
Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I got it from the tournament directory.
That's all he needs.  He's making the moves.  It's an opening.  I just can't remember the name.  Okay, it's a game.  He's starting it, so he moves first.  He's white.  e2-e4.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
He knows you're aware of that.
Then I'll transpose.
About what?
Feel like practicing?
Sara, this is Doctor Sheppard.  I called you earlier about a book.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
How come you don't stay with them?
Do you always open quickly?
In a way.
This isn't a game.
You mean like in the steam room?
That's not fair!
How could you?  Unless you were there.
Why?
Because I think he's wrong.
I'm sure you are.
She died in a car accident.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Then show me who you are.
You.
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
I tried again and got through.
--admit what?  That I was right about you in the steam room?  That you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  Would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No he didn't.
I got lucky.
Do we have a future?
I don't know. It's a maze of tunnels. I can't see out.
Come quickly, Colwyn. I can see the eyes of the Beast.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Does the Queen live?
We were married. Then she was taken by the Slayers. You must help me.
You have rope?
Darkness. Tunnels and corridors.  Wait.
But you suspect.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
I chose the wrong passage.
No! You cannot know that!
I can. Because I choose it.
I road them often in my youth.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
Yes.
I ache with it.
One night is no betrayal. Have pity on me.  Please, I beg you, do not refuse me. You do not know the price.
<u>What</u>? Oh no! Better it was me. There isn't another good tomato within a hundred leagues.
Fame.
Fame?  Thank you, no. Fame is the burial ground of contentment. Eat it and go hungry; count it and go broke; seek it and grow mad. Fame is what fools yearn for and wise men shun.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I'm all right.
Not sleepy, either?
Those are not child's tear. A child cries for himself, a man cries for those he loves.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Can't I come, too?
Surely a sorcerer of the sauce pan can make rabbit taste like venison.
He was aiming a huge spear right at me!
He will not!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
It is important to assure the succession.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
How many did you lose?
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Each to his fate. Wait for me at the inn. If I am not back by dawn, you will know my fate, and you must go on without me.
She bore you many children?
You said nothing. You told me nothing.
Those are reflections.  <u>This</u> is my face!
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
Why do you want to know?
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Take them, you never know... If you want to have some fun. Take, it's a gift.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
Too heavy.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death.  For the moment, I have none of the two!
...Don't you like me?
Nothing, for the moment.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Not at all, Mathilda! I tell you because it's true! You'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, OK? We'll go where you want! I swear, you'll see, Mathilda!!
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
Huh? Are you Alfredo's son, then?
It's a specialty down there.  It's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. Then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
Adelle... Maurice is in the paper.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Maybe later.
How serious is it?
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
That's enough.
I'm going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
You do?
The flowers... they're beautiful.
It's just a regular day.
Well, I'm sure it's not Christmas, because you'd be worried about how much money we don't have to spend on each other... I know it's not New Years, because you'd be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you don't like to dance... and I'm sure it's not our anniversary, because I didn't find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'Pick out something pretty'... Yes -- Maurice -- I'm virtually certain it's not a special day today.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
No.
It'll make it.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
I don't want my wife's soul having any doubts.
I'm Maurice Parker... I'm much older than three.  Are your parents home?
Nine.
... Round The World In Eighty Days. ... Hello Kris.
She knew you loved her.
I do.
Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
Confused.  I'm not sure what to do now.  I'm not sure what he wants for me.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
What do you want?
No.
Hello.
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Of course.
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
What do you mean?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Sera you are crazy.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time.  Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
Be careful.
I don't understand any of that.
They wouldn't know.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
How much, do you think?
All of it. I need to buy many things... all of it!
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
But it's a top three school --
Yes, but your major is Fashion Merchandising. Harvard won't be impressed that you aced "History of Lycra". What are your backups?
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
Where they saw you standing over the body covered in his blood.
You're fired. I have new representation.
That's not what's important.
I got up, went to Starbucks, went to the gym, got a perm, and came home.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
-- uh --
I think so...
That's because men are big, fat retards who don't -- Oh, my God...
Have you ever considered asking him if he'd like a cold beverage? Or perhaps a neck massage?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
I have the highest GPA in Delta Gamma!
Power yoga?
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
But maybe it's not what you think.
Maybe not to your face...
It would be a full-service law firm, by and for blondes, providing positive blonde role models and community outreach in high blonde areas. I mean, think about it -- name one blonde intellectual role model.
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Well, in all likelihood, she's completely guilty as well. She was seen standing over her husband's dead body.
Of course, I do!
And I fully support that.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
You got into Harvard Law?
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
Precisely.  Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Fire moat... why do that?
We go out, smash 'em now?
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
You go to lady now?
To finish last evening's delightful work.
And you... are you not also afraid?
Like some vile toadstool.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
What do you want from me?
Might we watch, too?
And, now?
Or looked so beautiful...
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
No more listening!  Your time is at an end, insignificant whelp!
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
To be sure.
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
He is afraid of enchantment!  Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Don't you know?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Fie on what she thinks!  You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
And who might that be?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Aye!  That too.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
Whatever for?
Sounds like the bird we want.  All right lads, follow yon raven!
Stoutly spoke, lad.  These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
Heading true north.  We continue in that direction.
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
There isn't much time!
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
Fire away!
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Sunlight.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
I was with the Princess.
Gonna make ogre-stew!
Very thrifty.  Even got your arrow back.
They've fired the moat!
Nay, Sire, I'll cling to it as to life itself...
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
A gentleman would offer water.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
Who?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
They tricked you.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
Sunlight?
Lili... I love you!
Ask away, sweet man.
As fair as me?
I'd be honored.
Only that?
And charmed, of course.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Oh, but I have.
Yes, yes... Jimmy Squarefoot good friend to one and all...
You follow.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
Who are you?
What color?
Here, honey!
Has he eaten anything at all?
Who are all these people?
What's that?
You're a good girl.
What did you think it would be?
Where to?
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I might not stay, anyway.
I'm okay.
I don't even...what do you mean?  I don't even know what that means.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Are you afraid of heights?
He's got a standing invitation.
It could have been a squirt gun.
An exhaust system or a window is code.
That's too long.
We were probably in school together.  You went to Berkley?
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
Well, it's the least I can do.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
No I'm not!
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
I'll hate you forever.
I almost saw Catalina.
Why?
I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
You'll have money when you work for it.
Don't.  I don't want it.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
What would you be doing now?
Sun glasses?
Why wouldn't she leave?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
It's okay.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
I'm not talking just physically.  Even your anger is perfect.
What did you do with your dog?
Why would they tow your truck?
I was parked in day parking.
Where will you live?
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
One of you would end up dead.
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I used to live here.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
I think so.
That was the truth.
You bit my finger.
If I weren't married?
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Does Alyssa know?
Sooner than the Fall.
Sam took them to a movie.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Depends on what I'd give up on.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Dad said it first.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Then what's the problem?
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Half the men in this prison swear they're innocent. Don't you think that's kinda funny?
Sure, boss.
I'm not your boss. Not anymore.
He don't sound like he's from 'round here.
I don't need the Baptists on my back, but I suppose I could issue a temporary marriage license for a nominal fee.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Claude Banks.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Well, if you must know, bank teller at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm responsible for keeping track of hundreds, occasionally thousands of dollars.
I didn't start out to be a bank teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer. Even had an offer to play short for the Newark Eagles.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
At some point a man's got to get serious about his future. I'm sure you have no idea what I'm talking about.
Looks like a fake to me. Loan denied!
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
You're soft.
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
Guess we better get going, huh?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
So you made a generous contribution.
What are you talking about?
He's dead.
It ain't here.
He does it all by himself.
Pack of lies. Don't listen to him. We didn't kill nobody. We were railroaded. And we gonna prove that.
You know what I'm saying.
New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
I can't eat it with mustard.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
Him?
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
Don't matter who Camp 12 puts on the mound. All I know is when this season's over Camp 8's gonna have pork chops.
Here's a news flash, Ray. We never were friends. We've just been stuck together for 12 years. It's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you. Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I'd never bumped into Ray Gibson.
That was five years ago.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
Why the hell not?
Gimme that damn thing.
Hell of a day, Ray. Yankees are on fire.
Yeah? You and what army?
Those are for trusties, unless you got thirty cents or two packs of cigs.
No problem. Oh, boy!
New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
I was already here a good many years when they came in in 1932.
Sixty-five years ago. They always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. Looks like you're finally free, boys.
Just like Elvis.
It'll be too late.
I'm sorry, I don't keep any liquor in the house.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
I'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
You shouldn't have come here.
Please, get out of my mind!
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
I am concentrating. Where can we rule?
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
She's so nice.
Yeah, you do...
No.
Oh. Sorry.
Put it in your mouth.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting.  That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Coulda been much worse.
That's what I'm thinkin'...
Should we wake him up?
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
Yes, great movie...
I was DeNiro!
All right...
You smell like coconuts.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
You think I'm a tourist?
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
What are you doing?
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
I have to, Valerie.
No.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
We were sent here and you know it. Others have been sent here. Where are they? Hiding?
Where do you send them?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Not in my time...
Of course not! I'm curious, not sick. 
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
Later.
Curious.
Not about that.
I'm listening.
Thanks... but I have the choice.
It's different now. Help me.
Uh-uh.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
For us.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Don't ever let go.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
It could be...
He had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
To what?
You're both full of secrets like Macavity.  Did you steal this?
What makes you think so?
I'm sorry but I don't have anything to give you.
My father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "Beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
Oh my... I'll try.
No. Jessica goes back now. Take her back.  Now! Go on back. Back outside, Jessica.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little?  Too little. Okay, wait for me.
Texaco... What's wrong with that?
You okay?... What's wrong?
What is?
No. Fred hates them.
Yeah... Laurent.
Yeah, I remember.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know his name. He's a friend of Dick Laurent's, I think.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Yeah? what did they want?
No.
Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
No.
The first night... Not the last two.
My... My head.
The pain is getting worse. I need more aspirin.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
I called, you know.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
What?
It's okay with Arnie... Come on, let's go.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
No... Thank you!... I'll be bringin' the "Caddy" by tomorrow.
It'll be ready.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
Who is this?
Last time I saw you.
It was weird...
Sheila?!
Nothin'... You want to go for a drive?
Come on... get in.
I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
Yeah.
Look Sheila... I'm sorry...
"Leaving today for London with Conway aboard S.S. Manchuria. Conway can tell nothing of his experiences. Is suffering from complete loss of memory. Signed, Gainsford."
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
That's ridiculous.
It certainly is.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Just call me Barney.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
Horns?
Huh?
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Thank you.
Who and what is Shangri-La? You?
Well, it must have taken
That, my dear Conway, is the story of a remarkable man.
Oh, no. Just a little bowled over, that's all.
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Oh, I'm so glad.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
How can we get in touch with them?
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't
Yes.
Come on! We'll burn the hangar. That will make light for them!
Yes.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
I don't know.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Porters?
So you think I'm mad?
So you think it's all nonsense, huh?
I don't need any proof.
I knew there was a reason I hated this place. I'd give half my life to fly over it with a load of bombs just for what they've done to you. How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof? All this talk about the Lamas being hundreds of years old. How do you know? Did you see their birth certificates?  I can't believe it, Bob. A bunch of decrepit old men sit around and dream about reforming the world. And you, Bob Conway - two-feet-on- the-ground Conway - want to join them. It's horrible.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Please, George. I don't want to talk about it anymore.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Maria?
What's she got to do with it?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
Why aren't you registered through our office?
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
You see, it's not a dream.
Why?
Yes.  Barney!
I guess I lost:
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
You do?
Yes, air.  But I'm usually wrong. Sir.
Kay...
You heard me.  You two, especially.
I understand.  Hey, it works for the Hasids, right?  No one recognizes them.
Something seem unusual to you about that?
Gee.  You really think?
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
I think that's what's happening...
We're rising.
Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Since as long as we've been keeping records...
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?
Kay, you're scaring your partner.
Actually, they disgust me.  But that's what I love about them.  Like a car wrack, you know, how you shouldn't look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you're a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
I guess you could say we're entopologists of a sort.
Out of focus?
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
What if I don't?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
Can you see?
Anderton --
I know... I do, too...
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You set your patients on fire!
Just tell me about the intended victim.  This Anne Lively...
Don't worry, Lamar.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Don't apologize, John.
We won't let them.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
All I need, some twink from the Fed poking around right now.  Check again with the paper, they had it forwarded.  See if the neighbors know where they went, check all relations --
I show a cop on horseback.
I've got no address -- last known or otherwise -- no tax returns for the last five years.
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
That's right.
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
I'm your son.  I'm you.
Did I?  I don't recall... I got lots of kids from that place --
Some -- somebody's father?
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
Kill me!
I'm... not... a... killer.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Why?
Insignificant to you maybe, but what about those people I put away with alternate futures?  My God, if the country knew there was a chance they might not --
I believe in that system...
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Then how did he --
Lara, I don't know why this is happening.  I just know they're setting me up.  I can't trust anybody.  I don't know who to talk to or where to go...  Lara?  Are you there?
Sean --
Tell him not now.
How?
I wanna kill my boss.
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Get the hell outta here.  You sick bastard.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
What?!
We can stop him.
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
It's not at all that you don't trust me to be alone with the Chief.  That you think I might, you know, fuck with him, if I had the chance...
Just sugar then.  You and John ever come here?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
It was nobody's fault.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
I can take you down there.
Are you sure?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
No. That's cool. Bring me back eighty.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
He's alright.
I know.
He's not doing it.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Uncle Bobby?
Who's watching the baby?
I feel weird asking him.
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
So, when's the drop.
To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
Where is this happening?
Nah, man. No one is. They got some Puerto Ricans and a new crop of fuckin Irish immigrants.
Ricky's taken care of.
I guess inside. Or he never made it. Either way, I don't give a shit. Let's get this over with.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
I'll work it off.
It's my fault. I send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then I wonder why you seered. It's my fault. The tooth is on me. But no more. I'm 'reassigning' you.
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Take a few days --
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
You're going to the Soho Grand hotel, right?
Yeah, he's getting there on his own.
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
So?
Don't be shitty.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
Cause if you don't know the number, I can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
He didn't say we need guns.
You don't imply about something like that. You lay it out on the table. Besides, I'm not taking the job.
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
Fuck him.
I like it.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
Why not? I grew up in bars. It's fun for a kid.
She really liked the kitchen.
What's the movie?
You sure?
Shhh... Hello, room service?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
How much was it?
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
They asked who it was.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
You fucking nuts?
We're not getting whacked.
We're getting ahead of ourselves. We haven't gotten any sleep. Let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. Now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
I'm tired and I'm scared, and I'm not looking at fucking penguins.
No more, man.
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
You're not getting a gun.
Take us right to Kennedy. Now.
No. I'll wait here.
Fine, fine. And you were...?
The line's over there.
Why? What I say bad?
Like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the Quick and Split.
That shouldn't be a problem.
Couldn't make it. Here's the money.
The Soho Grand?
So you're our own private guy?
Yeah, bring us four fernet.
We're going to New York?
What?
What about my keys?
You want... Why are you picking on me?
And, as for you, Bobby, you just moved up a notch. Your days of fighting for crumbs is through. Take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
He has a cute what...?
So, we're talking money laundering...
Edinburgh.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Heard where?
Man's rep travels.
How 'bout that?
No, my mama. She's from Grenada.
Yes, sir.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I don't want your money.
Let Billie finish.
You putting a hurtin' on my vision.
Put it in a cup of water. It's nutmeg.
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
Cause I don't want to walk around with my head all nappy, looking like --
A Muslim must be strikingly upright. Outstanding. So those in the darkness can see the power of the light.
But the key to Islam is submission. That is why twice daily we turn to Mecca, to the Holy of Holies, to pray. We bend our knees in submission.
I don't know what to say to Allah.
Come, sit with us.
Why not? You've had ample time, you and the sister.
If you want to tell me.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
Let me explain. No. I'll do better than that. I'll show it to you. Scientifically. But it's demonstration purely in the interest of science, you understand?
Delicious.
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh, yes, there is. I know a lot about you. Brother Bembry briefed me.
You have enough worries of your own.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
What have you set your mind to?
I love you.
Just hold me.
What do you think?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
That's enough, Brother Earl.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Preacher, take your tin Jesus and the Virgin Mary, both, and shove 'em.
That's right.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
For the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "Do you hate me!" The white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.
No. You'll be marked for death.
You hear me, girl?
He's bright.
Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
[South America.]
It's a little late.
Let's see how the relationship develops. I'll call you in the AM. Thanks.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
I show, you give me the information?
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[Yeah, I've got to get used to the routes. I -- It won't happen again.]
[Romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
[Ordered by who?]
[Who ordered it?]
[In the next hour, where do I find your partner?]
[Her life for your life.]
[The ransom was ten.]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Don't give me that bullshit.
Fuck, I love Mexico. I live like a king down here.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
And what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
Oh, now you think I can be trusted.
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking?
Oh...
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Where?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Yes.
Did you used to?
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
Could I stop you?
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
Dyslexic?
So are you.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
Last night. Do you know something?
What was her name?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
For an American she understands this country very well.
I'm trying, mom.
This is Mr. Creasy.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
Hmm?
[Is that good or bad?]
[I think he's... magnificent.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
[A beautiful circle.]
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I been looking all over for you!
It's early.
I feel fine.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
Thank you.
I really should get home...
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Marty...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
All right.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
I'm stag.
Where you going now?
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
What girl, what does she know?  Why don't you let her hold the baby once in a while?! Your mother, boy, she wantsa take the kid for a day, that's fine!
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
Put on your blue suit...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
...and they sit down right next to me...
What nurses?
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
They give you copies to burn.
Never this close.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Hospital.
He said it for us all, Walt.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
Finest kind. We'll sit where we can get the best view.
Well, southern boy, I suppose you want the sack that's convenient to the door.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
The chest-cutter.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
We didn't have a chance, little Androscoggin College against the Big Green, but there was this blizzard and we held then nothing nothing till the last twenty seconds. Then this great passer of theirs let one go, snow and all...
What do you think, Trapper?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
Yeah, if I can.
Be right with you.
Plus running the opium concession for the whole Eighth Army.
We think the same way.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
There's nothing to talk about, General. You take the case yourself or join me at three o'clock. Either way you're liable to learn something.
I think I heard about that.
Ho-Jon, give the Father some more martini.
No, no, that one.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Well, he wouldn't score more than once in seven or eight tries, but the important thing was he didn't waste time socializing. Anyway, Trapper John, this is Me Lay.
Radar!
Oh, Jesus.
On account he got caught in the doctor draft. He was a surgical resident playing semi-pro ball weekends when the Eagles signed him.
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
Not necessarily.
All of them?
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
It's my name. Maybe that sounds silly to you but...
I'm thinking about how we can make more money.  Suppose we bet only part of our dough and keep this big animal out of the game the whole first half and let them roll up some points. Then you could bet the rest of our bundle between the halves and get the General and his friends to give us some real odds.
They don't have to be dull. I mean if you and me put our minds together...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Very happily married.
But you've made me feel strong again, Captain. Hawkeye.  You helped me pull together when I needed it.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Why would he do that?
They're supposed to hold short-arm inspection.
Glad to help.
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
You can cut the bow.
I don't think so either.
Nope, we're assigned heah.
You mean who hit who?
I don't know. I must have lost my punch. I didn't think the son-of-a- bitch would get up.
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, dammit, and...
Splendid, sir. No problems.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
They can't do that to me!
Boys, we're home free.
Did you get it, too?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
No.
Oh. Yeah.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
Yes, I did, John. But II had no idea what was going on.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
A third party?
John! I'm so glad to see you. II was terribly worried.
All set, Ann?
Oh.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
There is no letter.
We'll get a handwriting expert to  What!
John Doe.
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Packs everything, including a gun.  Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
That's
He's watching the other door.
Look!
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
What Bert's trying to say iswellwe need you, Mr. Doe. There were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
Sure, you are.
Yeh.
John Doe Club?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
Well?
Yes. Sure.
No.
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Did you write itor didn't you?
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good peoplethey ought to run you out of the countryand I hope they do it!
Thanks.
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
She isn't?
Oh!
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait.  Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket
Hold him.  Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.
Shh!
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
No shit! He's good!
Fuck him. He swings at anything in the dirt. I could strike him out.
Clarence Teal.
I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
I won't get away with it.
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
I'll tell him. Where does he live. We'll get him on the phone right now.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
You got it.
We ran a search on relatives. He has a cousin in town -- Clarence Teal. Smalltime thief. Last known address was on Pine Street. He moved out a month ago. We've got a couple leads on him to check out.
Open the bag, dump everything on the table.
That's not going to look too good on your service record.
Furthest point I could find from New York.
Spent my whole life there. I just wanted to get out for a while.
Is there something wrong with that?
Then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
Yes.
Fine.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Do it!
Yeah.
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
I want to be put on this case.
Yeah, they are but...
I need to take back what's mine.
True.
There you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
-- No.
Then what?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
And down here --
Unfinished business.
It's his nature.
-- He will.
Have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  But remember, it's a capacity problem.  That's all.
Why?
Come on Tanner, think this through.
Times Square.
-- You told me.
Corporation can.
Of course you do.  And the only shot you've got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
What?!
Zordon...  he's gone.
The only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Where did it originate?
What's a Triac?
About twenty seconds in your time.
Listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that.  Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!
Activating Power Scope!
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
But ya got a Boss.
But not you.
Not another word.
That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
What's that divided four ways?
Get word to Maranzano. I want a meet. Alone. On neutral turf.
We got our boys paintin' the house next door. Around the clock. We're gonna keep old man Profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
Tommy Reina's hauntin' his dreams. But he'll do his job.
Ya ignorant Guinea, it's kreplach.
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
It's a mask.
Gives us something in common.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Oh, God. Don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
Married? To Anna?  You ain't got her in trouble?
Good. 'Cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
The fat man's scared. Scared of us, and scared without us. Same with Maranzano. We gotta get their minds back on each other. This fuckin' peace is killin' us.
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
I got a place for you. In my family... or in the cemetery.
Calculated risks. But Boss, this one don't calculate.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Couple hands. No harm in it.
You get fifteen percent.
Your Calabrian friend, I will accept. At least Costello eats pasta like us.
Shuddup.
I think these rich shits -- no offense Bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
Come on. Be polite.
Jesus.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
Switch hands.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Animals? What <u>kind</u> of animals?
Stu Miley.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
<u>Why</u>??
Back? You're sending me back?
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me <u>die</u>.
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Kid, listen: <u>that's all I'm saying</u>. And you didn't hear it from me.
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
I've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I'm good.
You know ...  ... whoops!
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I'd love to.
Mm hmm.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit around and listen.  What's this?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
Swell. Thanks very much.  Good luck, Senator. Keep your left up.
Never.
I'm saying I didn't sign it!
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Let's send out a pigeon!
No!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. *Now* what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
Who?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Well, well--  Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd slip one over on the old man in the press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, about the monopoly investigation--" And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, if you were sitting in my chair, would you answer the question you're about to ask?" He had me.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Waiter!
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
How about getting married?
Okay. You don't mind?
Well, let's get going.
You know, we're getting married.
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
No, no--believe me, pet--this is *most* urgent--  Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?-- Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
That settles it! I will not be attacked and belittled by my own children in my own home! My nerves are strained to the breaking point!
All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate office building--nice, big clean desk--lot of Senator stationery to write his little boys on--and Foley's secretary, Saunders, to make it look like the real thing--
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
Horace Mill--!
I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--
Me! Jim--how--?
This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
Aw--
Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm convinced our State has a great debt of gratitude to you--
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
What? Who?
What makes you think he's got *anything* to do with it?
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Here--where are you running off to?
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Like what, Mr. Taylor?
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
J-Jefferson Smith.
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
I don't believe I've been so thrilled in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking right at you as you come up the steps-- sitting there like he was waiting for someone to come along--
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Committee, huh?
Why?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
Thanks very much.
And something else, too, Miss Saunders-- the spirit of it--the idea--the--
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
Have I?
Go right ahead.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
Well--nobody calls you anything but Saunders.
Abigail.
I've got more. You better tell me.
No! Letters. I've got to write to the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' with news! Why, I've introduced a bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and talked in the Senate! 
Don't mention it--
Saunders--!
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
Oh--Saunders--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
You see--if we could take the poor kids off the streets--out of cities-- a few months in the summer--learn something about Nature and American ideals--
That's--that's splendid.
The Senator will please suspend until order is restored in the chamber.
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
--now he wants to talk to the Congressmen from the Willet Creek districts--he's run their names down--
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
What do you mean?
What are you talking about? What difference--?
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
How much does the Willet Dam mean to you, Jim?
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Just a minute, Joe!
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
He was a seven-months baby.
Next, please.
I haven't.
Yes!
Yes!
Yes, but I
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
Yes.
Why don't you try?
I'd like to read it some time.
No, I don't mind.
I'm crucifying him.
People have been crucified before.
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Hello.
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
With pay!
Have lunch.
Sure.
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Yes.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again!  I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yes! Yes! Let's get on with it.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Where?
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
No, thank you.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
Huh?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
Is Mr. Deeds in?
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Why should you?
No, thanks.
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
What're you talking about?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
It reminds me very much of this one. Nicht wahr?
It takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may I show you? May I use the chart?
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
No, I mean - about my client.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Now wait a minute, buddy
Well, I play the tuba.
Yes?
I write poetry.
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
Fun?  Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
Don't pay any attention to her.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota - north?
Is Mary home?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
Yes, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
What two policemen?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
What, sir?
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
What happened?
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
Uh-huh.
What's that?
Not any more.
Right now?
How do you mean?
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Go to hell.
It's a thought I had.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
You've done well.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Yeah.
Oh, so that's him? The Panda Man.
Doc.  Ainge...
Doc.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You're right, as usual. See you.
Got to.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What?
I think you know what I mean.
Take a hike, Dr. Quack!
Could I see Sofie, please?
Hmm.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
It's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
You like it?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
That's... good?
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you.  Not one who's treating me, of course.  And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
I don't follow you.
But...
I know it! Please believe me, I know that...
Will you wait for me?
Weekly or monthly?
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Where was this?
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Well, there's Lily.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
I wondered what happened to her...
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
Are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
Well, okay then.
You always did have more balls than brains.
Even?
Sounds familiar.
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river!
Do you know where I can steal some?
Do you truly wish to know? Or would you prefer to just shoot us?
Exactly --
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Try me.
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
Water turning to blood.
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for nothin'.
Fifty percent.
What are you doing here?
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?
The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
I know my treasure.
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No, we are not.
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll have you know, that at this moment my career is on a high note.
You lied to me!
Personally, I think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. I don't like him one bit.
No kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
I'm with you, old man. No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it.
I know you did.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
Head hunting.
So who killed him?
The Disco Boys.
He's dead.
Against.
You're dead.
So are you!
Sure -- I guess.
Curiosity.
What?
Every night.
It is?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
Who wouldn't?
Then at least I will have died trying, right?
Monica!
I just know.
The wise snake coils before he strikes.
He's got the fact that he's Superman!
Because that's what it is.
Okay, you win. I'm pissed off. I'm seriously peeved.
With what?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
Not yet.
Ask her out.
Who are they?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
If I may, Your Majesty, I would like to offer a dissenting opinion.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
The point is that I don't think Napoleon will sit in Moscow until the spring!  I don't think he can afford to.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I know absolutely nothing of war -- and I am still totally dependent upon my generals.
I don't even know whether a defense is possible.
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
You could have them here by daybreak.
Would you be prepared to handle this for me?
And where is the army?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Bertrand, sire.
No, sire... I was asleep.
Come in.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
At first, it hardly seemed more than a routine fire.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Yes -- an excellent idea.
I very much doubt that he will.
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
No...
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
You must not act impetuously.
Only as a last resort.  What are the Councils doing now?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
Were they pretty?
She must have been in love with you.
I know what you're doing in there.
Where is Madame Trillaud?
Oh, my darling.  I'm sorry, too.  I won't do that again -- whatever you do.  I won't cause you any more embarrassment, I promise.
I didn't want to hurt you... All I wanted to do was to keep from hurting you.  I swear I didn't want to hurt you.
I couldn't face telling you.
What was there to tell?
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Does she deserve anything better?
Do you think Alexander has any chance to succeed as a mediator?
What I am talking about is moderation.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Thanks, Unc.
Well, let me in.
Cash money.  They wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  That's for suckas.  They got my daddy like that for a Cadillac years ago.  I got the only house on the block that's paid for. That's why I'm the king around here.
Never...  But me and Suga can get real nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Can I look for myself?
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
What?
Because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  And I'm just trying to keep the peace.  We moved out here to get away from that shit.
I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
D'Wana brought Baby'D up here.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Yes I did.  Excuse me.
Why didn't she put'em out?
I'm sorry to hear that.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
Have you seen Day-Day?
Smokin' what?
Nothing.
Negative...they vamped.
Sorry, dude.
You could sell your Beamer.
Thanks for the help.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Yeah, I got a urgent message for a customer named William Jones.  Drop everything, Craig is in trouble.  Come quick.  Don't try to call.
Keep pushing.
Shut yo' ass up.
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
Business.
Huh?
Of course.  I wish everything were that easy.
That's right.
It was because I had this...in my pocket
I don't know. The only thing I know about him is that he works for your husband.
And your husband works for somebody else.
Indeed.
For not believing you.
I'd like to know what...
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
The gun...
Tell me why I miss him.
You fucked up.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
That's right. That gives you...
You know what I'm gonna do.
No, that's,..that's fine
It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
It's a twenty.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
Thank you.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
A surprise?
It better be.
Shut up.
Keep your eyes peeled.
'Daddy has to go now.
Put her on.
You, Preacher?
Yes, Dad.
Not even her?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Don't!
A man of the Cloth?
Twenty-five wives!
John don't like him much.
There's something else.
Thank you, no. Thank you, dear Icey. I'll tend to them. Thank you.
There! What's so hard about that!
John! Don't!
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
Why?
Hush.
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
What's taking you so long about it?
Pearl's junk. Mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Where's the money hid.
I -- no, I --
My flesh and blood!
I been out with men.
John and Pearl!
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Shut up and let me in. You ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off.  You believe it's possible to dream about what's going to happen?
Yeah.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
He's dangerous.
Please. I'm gonna go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. I just need you be right there to arrest him. Okay?
We should get her out of here...
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Of course. What's that?
Bring me forty-five back.
An omelet.
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
That's right.
Right now it's on the balcony.
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
What is it?
That's right... and we might as well face it.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
The Duchess...
Oh, yes, yes.
Good morning, Gaston.
I am, Gaston.
Have you?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
If you want to see us you must come later.
But you can't...
Get out of here!
Razinin.
A day.
A cow?
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Yes, there's no doubt of that...  Just look out of the window and there it is.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
We did our utmost to have it set ahead.
Yes. It is unfortunate.
You want me to go in there?
Confess what?
No visa.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
Gladly.
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it!  Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Bohme... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction!  It will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look....  What do you see?
Is that customary?
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
The bayonet? Did you really?
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
As a representative of Moscow...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
I always eat here.
What are you after?
Just smile.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Then you should go back to your table.
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
All right.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Did you win?
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
No... please...
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
I'm afraid that's what it is.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
We have nothing to discuss.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
Where are they?
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Yes.
The future of the common people.
Where is that?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
Then tell Richardson to fire him.
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
So ... let's go ...
That's Helms.  He's "sang froid," a world-class poker player.
We could get that.
Uh huh ...
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
You do it.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
So you tell Mitchell ...
Jesus!  Through a window?
No!  Magruder!  That sonofabitch tests my Quaker patience to the breaking point.
Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
This is not a joke, John!
No, sir.
It's marked.  Also there's June twenty third.  And this year -- March twenty first.  Those are the ones ...
You've never been a greater example to the country than you are now, sir, but ... but you need to get out more, sir, and talk to the people.  No one I know feels ... close to you.
That's what they're doing.
It's gone.  No one will ever find out what's on it.
Sir?
Evidently to install bugs and photograph documents.
That fruitcake!  What about him?
What's Liddy got?
Apparently he was using some campaign cash that was laundered for us through Mexico.  The FBI's onto it.  We could have a problem with that.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
How is this national security?
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Yeah, but Roselli wasn't just any gangster.  He was the gangster who set up Track 2 in Cuba.
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
Sir?
It's the parents' fault really.
Sir?
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
Why would they?!  Who the hell's Sulzberger anyway?  Their parents are gold traders from Eastern Europe. They buy things.  They come to Jew York City and they buy up things.  One of the things they buy is the New York Times.  And you know what?  Be proud because they'll never trust you, sir, because we speak for the average American.
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm interested in the documents that put your people together with ... the others.  All of them ...
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
So President Kennedy thought.
Edgar, think twice.  He works in the kitchen.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
You should ask Bobby.
I never met the man.
I know you've been very careful not to.  That's why I'm concerned.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Who we working for?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
We'll see about that.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
Here, Tim ... Tim.  I'm as frustrated as you, Henry, but don't you think this one's a Democrat problem.  They started the war; it makes them look bad.
He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children.  He sees a shrink in L.A.  He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead.  He must be stopped at all costs.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Mr. President, this cannot be breathed!  Especially to our secretary of state -- that cretin Rogers ... The Chinese would never trust us again. The only way, I emphasize only way, to pull this off is in secret.
They will understand, sir.  To be undone by a third-rate burglary is a fate of biblical proportions.  History will treat you far more kindly than your contemporaries.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Just ... uh ... you know.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
That was Mr. Kennedy.
That has the added virtue of being true.
Free, if you're the president.
How about Kissinger along with him?
The Jewboy's a Harvard whore with the morals of an eel -- sells himself to the highest bidder.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
My brother Harold was about the same age as those kids, John.  Tuberculosis got him.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
That was a long time ago.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Right, right.  I used to play a little ball myself at Whittier.  Of course, they used me as a tackling dummy.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Sir?
Well, we could delete it.
I sure am.  The goddamned missile crisis united the whole country behind Kennedy.  And he was supporting Brown. People were scared, that's why.
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
No.
Brezhnev's coming in three days.  I don't want to deal with them.  And him.  And you.
Thank you?  Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
To what?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
Some pretty bad people.
You sure?
What calibers you got there, Sheriff?
But you don't believe it.
I don't know. Oh.
Wasn't no bullet.
Yes sir.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Lord no. I'm not retired.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
At the gettin' place.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Yes ma'am?
I shall return.
She'll be all right.
Yes I did.
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
All right...
I don't know.
I don't need to talk to you.
Do you know where I'm going?
It doesn't make any difference where she is.
Nobody. Accounting.
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Well...
Call it?
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Nineteen fifty-eight. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails, and you have to say. Call it.
Sir?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
That's twenty-six dollars.
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms?
I got an overcoat on.
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
Anyway, so what?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
We think we know where Betty is.
Tell him what you told me.
Little place called "Williams," why?
Great. Good. Content...
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
Umm, I don't think that...
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
The LeSabre!
What?
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
Roy! What are you doing here?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
Man, that is love.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Doctor David Ravell.
He is real.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
I have to leave now.
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
If we're for real?
Fine. You got five...
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
Like what?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
Joyce was screwing Del.
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
No.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
You made your point...  I was wrong.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
What the hell's going on?
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
No! Let me try this!
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Would you say she was ambitious?
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Know him? We were gonna get married! He was gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!...
God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell, Ravell... where's he out of?
Loma Vista?  You mean like the guy on "A Reason to Love?"
I swear to God!
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
Huh?
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.  What kind of work do you do, Big Dan?
Waitaminute -
Do not seek the treasure!
Huh?!
Delmar what the hell are you talking about? - We got bigger fish to fry-
Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him.  The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon.  These things-
Not that I'm aware.
He was never turned into a frog!
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Campaign manager? Waldrip.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
Now hold on, Pete, we gotta speak with one voice here - CAREFUL WITH THAT FIRE NOW, BOYS!
Don't I know it.
You didn't know that at the time!
What about you, Delmar? What're you gonna do with your share a that dough?
It just never fails; once again you two hayseeds are showin' how much you want for innalect. There's a perfectly scientific explanation for what just happened -
You got a maiden name, Daddy?
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Why?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Nobody. It just came to me.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
I wrote. Not every week...
Great. You can go in my place.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I know.
No, sir.
No, sir!
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
Zack, don't!
Yes, sir!!
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Do you honestly think you'll find a boy in that... that officer's school who's serious about marriage?
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Vietnam?
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Then, I'll see you around.
How late?
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
What?
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Yeah... Mmmm...
You hope.
What do you mean?
No! That's not true!
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel.  Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
Please...
Two.  Squeeze harder.
Th --
She better.
I know.
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
Different tables.
Shit!
Oh, that phone call...
Master closet.
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
It's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  One really can't be too careful about home invasion.
None, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
What?!
Shaky?
On it!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
Stop it.
They're hurting us, baby. Huey locked up. Bobby Seale running all over the country holding things together. Cy dead. Little Bobby... I don't recognize half the faces at meetings.
I'm okay... listen to me...  Let's go with Judge, check it out.
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
What's up?
No. I've seen Black men handing out bags of food. Having meetings. Patrolling the neighborhood. Having more meetings. They ain't...
Mothafuck... Hey!!! What the hell!!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
You know it. Stay Black...
I don't know. Look around man.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
You joining? My Brother..  My brother.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Yeah, but aligning with white organizations. I'm not sure now's the time.
The white power structure wants us to act like savages.  But we're a different kind of animal altogether. We're Panthers. And The Black Panther Party for Self Defense is very painfully aware that America has historically reserved its most barbaric treatment for non-white people since the beginning of the country. So we need to organize, we  keep our shit correct! And effect revolution. We revolve the power into the hands of the people. Where it belongs.  Power to the people baby...
Yeah... Bobby you gotta...
We're like policing the police.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
I assure you that we as the revolutionary vanguard are as serious about this as you are. We'll be prepared.
So I guess it's safe to say you know about firepower.
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
And who is we?
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
No.
No.
That would be nice, too.
Not many.  Dalton, Scott, they've got their reasons; Rev. Oliver, he believes in the cause; some of the young bucks; a few like me with nothing to lose...  What about you?  You've got a lot to lose.
Pride will do.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
With a lace table cloth?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Sir?
What officers?
Sir.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
Pride is his weakness.
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
He left us.
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Name five hundred.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
That's five, keep going...
I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle.  He spent too many years in the British army.
Who's in command?
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
How many men have we seen die?
No.  It's not over yet.  Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton.  It will end, one way or another.  Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Quiet.
You'll see soon enough, hon.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Of course I will.
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Do you believe that?
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Ain't it just? The man who invented beer, Louis, that man was having a prime day for himself.
What?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
Ayuh.
This time I mean it.
Why, then, things should be fine.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Louis, are you sure?
They'll be anchored on the lee side.  Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island --
We got that part.  Anything else?
I'm supposed to ... trust you?
I'll torture it out of you.
Let's say I tell you the wrong person.  What would you do?
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
Aye, for us there is.
Or you could surrender.
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Thank you, sir.
I'm a bit nervous, myself --
What?
Yes -- yes.
Women in London must have learned to not breathe.
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
No, I'm -- rescuing you.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
Ah, well ... the company is better than last time.  And the scenery has definitely improved.
To the Black Pearl.
One, because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels. Two --
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Now, lad, just because it don't point north don't mean it don't work.  That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta, wherever it may lay.
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
My father.  William Turner?
Well, she had a very taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight.
Dr. Bright has escaped.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
She says it's not.
That remains to be seen.
Consideration?
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
You don't want this.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
I just want to know what goes on in the mind of a litterbug.  What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that tells you, 'It's okay, just chuck it'?
Aaabout...?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
I'm not sure.  That's the funny thing about him.  He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with O'Brien?
Been out for six months now.
Jesus, Daniel.  It wasn't Ryker's Island.  It was work camp for white collar criminals.
Yeah, we'll see.
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
We don't?
The waste.
You're the doctor.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Let's go.
You were looking for us?
An ass-beating.  Would you like yours first, Mr. Sim?
The question is, are you?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
So, it's obvious, huh?
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
How-di-do.
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is?  It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Your house?
Oh, shut up!
Oh, hello Mother!
Yeah, hello. How are you?
Oh yeah?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
Yeah?
Well - it's only April.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Yes, sir.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
I'm not quitting!
No!
Thank you, sir.
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
Not since you broke into society.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Nothing.
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Here you are.
It'll be ready in a minute.
Sorry, boss
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Well, at best you might deny it.
I have. Double-strength!
All right, Grandma
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
The name is Smythe.
You try it.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well sir, I'll show you.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
How about me?  Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
Yes.
Thanks.
Ah.
I'm fine.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
... It's a pretty short trip.
Thanks ... I love you.
No, no ... Come on in.
She's crying.
Yeah. It does.
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
No I'm not.
Um ... It's ...
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Oh you bet.  Will you excuse me for a sec?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
What are you doing?
It's six-thirty ...
With what?
What?
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
That's not going to happen!
"Changes."
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Sure. Everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
Why am I out of order?
Um ... I don't know how to do that, Bob.
What is it?
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
What happened?
Play along?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
It's in your closet.
So what's the point?
Nothing.
You don't understand. You're messing with their UNIVERSE.
Well if I don't who will?
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
No. I baked them for you.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
You don't know?
Yeah.
Sure ...
... Like Prince Charming.
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Ooomph?
What the hell's going on!
Where are you going ...
A deluge doesn't just "happen." Bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  You burned down an ELM tree for Christ's sake ...
... Only if they mean it.
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I understand.
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
Thanks.  But this morning I was thinking about it and I realized that I looked forward to it all year. And then I thought "Gee. That seems awfully silly. That seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
I brought you something ... From the library.
Open it.
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Well, I can't talk though --
I don't think I'm going to the party.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to be your friend.
I'm sorry.
Are you gonna do it?
I just want to know where she's staying.
I'm just laying on my bed.
...just talking to you....
You sound very cute, very nice.
I'm going to work.
Can I ask you a question?
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
....this is your mistake....
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Do you know them.
I think that'll be fine.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Sure.
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Yeah.
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Nothing.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
Yeah.
I'll see you later.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
You can't do that.
For what?
Ok, bye, bye.
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Hello, how are you?
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
337.....I'm sorry....
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
I think you have a call?
....I have seven.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I don't like the way I am sometimes.  Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Wait a minute --
Well....what do you want, then?
Yes I am.
I'll see you there.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
So...did my brother call you?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Then what's he doing here?
At your service, Count.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
By whom? The Marquis?
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
Do I have your word?
That's enough.
Go to hell!
Was it impotence?
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
No one can fault Napoleon for merely bringing a man to his senses.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
I don't believe it!
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
Go on, child.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Carole, you wound me! As if I could hope to pacify you with evasions of--
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Don't
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You needn't use that language with me
You are repellant when you drink.
How so?
I pay you a good deal of money to be my eyes and ears in Hollywood, do I not? If you cannot provide this simple service you are of no use to me.
Please be quiet.
We're not all hopped up on benzedrine, Orson I Some of us humans need sleep!
Orson, hold on. Look into my eyes. Tell me you are not doing Hearst.
Can I talk to Hearst?
Showing life
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Christ, we gotta go! The old man doesn't cotton to lateness.
No, it's perfect! When in doubt, put on a cape! False noses and faux beards and flowing capes have been the life-blood of the actor's craft since the days of lrving and Booth.  Imagine me in a glittering suit of lights on the dusky Andalusian plains--
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
Listen ... I've got it! It came to me like a thief in the night! Pure inspiration! Total magnificence!
This better be good
Please don't say this.
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
I don't have it anymore?!
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
No, you gotta hear this-
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
Yeah, you're probably right.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
That's for me to decide.
You're lying to me.
Get out.
They've all seen a rough cut
When Hedda says "I'm coming" you mix a lot of martinis and you pray.
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
For Christ's sake, shut up--
How dare you talk to me like that! Do you think I'm like all the rest of those pirates?! Like Mayer and Warner? Is that what you think--?!
He's Christ?
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
I'm Ok.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
And where you goin'?
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Nah, not now... I wanna wait. I don't feel right...
Huh?
C'mon, hurry up. We're never gonna get outa here tonight.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
You won and was robbed! You didn't do nothin' wrong.
You want the title shot?
C'mon, Joey.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Well, you're wrong Jack. I'm tellin" you what happened. He got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
Stop it. What're you, crazy?
I just wanted to say hello.
If you let me do it, I'll murder you. Come here.
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What did I do?
You know what I'm talking about. Don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
What was it about?
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
Jake --
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Ok, all right. Telephone's in the hall. Dial his number.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Excuse me for living.
It don't look right.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Name me a better photographer.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
I'll bet it's been done.
Six ayem.
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I can't do it even if he's gone.
Give him evidence.
A detective's nightmare.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
That depends on who "they" were.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
I only have a hundred dollars or so.
Lisa Fremont.
She expects me to marry her.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Is what you want something you can discuss?
That's the hard part.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Yes.
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
To get on home.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That's what the witnesses told him.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
But you're not?
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Chelsea 2-5598.
Who's fighting?  This is the test, man.  It's a crazy game.
Know the Millertown bluff?
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
I think I should go home.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
I'm not hungry.
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
You don't want me to go.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me.  Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
He's just loaded, honey.
I was talking to Jim.
I still think you should go down.
Open it.
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
He has a knife.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
It's me!
There's only one key.
Come on!
I have to talk to someone, Mom.  I have to talk to you both.  And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Good Lord!
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
But you don't think that's a solution.
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Listen--
See?
Where what was.
See, I'm new.
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
A what?
Goodbye!  See you!
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
No.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
What a relief!
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Okay.
Hi.
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  Did you notify the parents?
My mother?
...whoever she is.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Negative five?
Radio said.
Smile.
I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time.
Tell me again.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
I'll see what I can do.
You sold him out.
When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?!
You're in on this.
Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now.
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Nick, what are you talking about?
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
He says he wants it now.
No.
No --
But I never said Rudy.
Put him in the truck.
But you were saying you were...
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Christmas... Eve...
This isn't the Tomahawk.
No way.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Hey! HEY! THERE IS A POWWOW SAFE!
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
Cancer-sucker.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
Hell yeah. You work here long?
I been in Iron Mountain for two years, truck driver. I do one more crime, I'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. You want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? I want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Ain't there yet.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Oh.
Take it, man! You're all right! Hold it in! GUARD!
Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
I'm ninety-two years old --
THEY'LL OPEN ONE!
I'M NOT NICK!
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
No. That your head's been up your ass. I walk through the door and Joe says "Vic, you're back, thank god. Finally somebody who knows what the fuck he's doing. Vic, Vic, Vic, Eddie, my son, is a fuck up." And I say "Well, Joe, I coulda told you that." "I'm ruined! He's ruining me! My son, I love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin' toilet! "  I'm not tellin' tales out of school. You tell 'im Joe. Tell 'im yourself.
Eddie, if I was a pirate, I wouldn't throw you to the crew.
Where was she from, Compton?
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
There is no fuckin' set up!  Look, this is the news. Blondie, you stay here and take care of them two. White and Pink come with me, 'cuz if Joe gets here and sees all those fucking cars parked out front, he's going to be as mad at me as he is at you.
A little.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
Fuckin' A. I tell it real good, too.
What? Snap out of it!
Sure.
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
What do you care?
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.
Who gives a damn?
How many employees?
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
You do?
Your name's Freddy something.
You didn't ask.
No, I'm not!
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard -
Oh this is bad, this is so bad.  Is it bad?
This is so fucked up. Somebody fucked us big time.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
I got the diamonds.
Where? Are they out in the car?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
We can't take him to a hospital.
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
So you wanna git bit, huh?
You said yourself, you thought about takin' him out.
Maybe he did.
Yeah. Keep a closer eye on her --  And him. Shootin' going on, we'll never find Lednov.
You can stay here if you like.
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Go on, there's a good boy.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
We can't stay here!
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
Thanks.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Maybe it's better that way.
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
All right, you didn't know.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
I like it.
What do you know about that. Did you sell your place?
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
I knew something would happen when they started puttin' up fences and passin' laws.
He certainly could. About a month.
Yeah, we sure have.
That won't help the stone bruise. You ain't been around horses much, looks like.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
I feel good anyways.
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Well, actually, we've never met officially, but I bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. I said, "I'm sorry," and you said, "Watch it, white bitch, or I'll put my size eight in your ass." I thought how cool. I wear a size eight, too. Anyway, this is my best friend, Cindy.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
Thanks.
It's Hanson, he's evil. Let's get him!
But he could still be haunting the house. He's angry that he had to leave.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. Stuff like that, you know.
Great!!!
Huh?
Shit!
No. Try a little higher.
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
Let's get a hot dog.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Not in a thousand years.
Both of them?
This can't be happening?
Quick, everyone to the lab.
We have to destroy him.
No, my friends are right here!
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
Okay, I guess. It's so intimidating. You know being away from home, not knowing anyone. I feel like such a geek sometimes. Everyone's so cool and I'm so not.
Let me see the files.
They're on top of the bookshelf. I'll get them.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Yes, but I've seen the tapes. This poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. We all could be in danger. I say we pull the plug.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
Alright, go to the belt store...
It's okay. I understand.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Dog, you look hot.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Fucked me."
Mother? 
Well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Because it's the rules!
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
Oh Mom...
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Chip, the only cereal I know about is Rice Krispies.
That's right.
You mean for TV or print?
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
That's nice.
You bring me such peace...
Ooohhhh!
...People who don't mind their own business.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Who is this?
No, I don't.
Socially... I'll have a beer.
Yes, I was.
I didn't want that Faberge egg - it was chipped!
Yes... but... I didn't...
What's he know?
You can?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Thank you.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
As a man, you distrust me - perhaps you believe me as a physician.
About forty-five dollars.
I can't understand it at all.
"The Dante?"
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
What were you talking about?
And that was all?
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
Drink your milk.
I'd like that.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -
What things? Why?
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
You don't even know Jacqueline Gibson.
I don't know.
And then?
And Gregory -- he loves her.
I understand.
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
I've lost my knack.
Tell me where Jacqueline is - we've got to find her.
I'll do all I can to help. I'll go to my publisher tomorrow.
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
No. She's no longer under my care.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
That's too bad.
It will make you unhappy to find Jacqueline. It would put her in danger --- great danger --
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur  The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Because I have something very important to do.
When?
But he also wrote --
I can quote that too; "Those who shall go out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall die."
I should have known. She had no sincerity - no real belief.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
You mean like "time flies"?
Yes. I was surprised that he accepted when I asked if I could stay here until I found a place.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do.  I'm getting confused.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
What?
Aren't you?
Basically, yes.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
What kind of personal project?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
She said it on her tape.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
That's a good question.
Yes.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
And now you can?
Now I make sure that no one has the opportunity to test me.
I'm babbling.
You should be. He lied to you. So did Cynthia.
But I don't understand --
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Like maybe a big part?
I don't know.
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say "That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems, Ann, it's not that neat, it's not that tidy! It's not a series of little boxes that you can line up and count. Things just don't happen that way.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I'm sorry. It's just... I'm under a lot of pressure with this Kirkland thing, it's my first big case as junior partner, and I work all day, I come home, I look forward to seeing you, and... it hurts that you accuse me like that.
He does.
Yes.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Not really.
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Well, I wonder why.
He doesn't have a phone.
But he won't.
What's wrong with that?
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Then why'd you call me?
Questions about sex.
I feel like I do.
Hold on.
It was busy.
I just want to know why you're here.
Nope.
Nope. I think the man is a liar.
What do you get?
Yes.
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
Describe for me your first sexual experience.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
What did you think? Did it look like you expected?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
Prettier than Ann?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
You know what I mean.
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Nothing wrong with trying.
What's so stupid about it?
That you... you don't even know the guy.
No.
It hurts that you would say that to me.
Graham.
Plus first and last month deposit.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
One moment.
Mr. Kirkland has asked me to inform you that he has obtained legal representation elsewhere, and that if you have a message for him to leave it with me.
All right, jesus.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
No. Dotty's the last.
I won't be at the office except to sign in.  I've got a lot of claims to check out. All over the place. Garages and more garages.  I'll come home right after work.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Well, at least you still talk the same.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
It was women did it to Hobbes. Couldn't handle them. That girl, that Annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
Yes?
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Time to check with Flavors.
As Janet's parents this should be really easy.  Your last clue... Mental Instability.  You have thirty seconds.
I've caught it once or twice.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Home?
Why Janet?
Show yourself.  The real you. The secret you.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Delighted, Betty -- That is if you don't mind being seen with an older man.
Isn't that Brad and Janet Majors sitting down front?  What an ideal couple.
Faith, Betty.  But make sure it's your own.
What are you trying to do?  Make Bert look like a fool?  He's made all the arrangements.
Let's just say that I'm putting sanity back on the national menu.
The question is, does Brad want to see you?  Quite frankly, he hates you.
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
I NEED SOME
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Flavors!
We understand you've been going through a rather trying time.
CRIMINAL
We all love Janet...Who do we love?
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
Huh.
I'm sorry, Miles.  So I don't know where that leaves us. I'm not sure how much more mileage I can get out of continuing to submit it. I think it's one of those unfortunate cases in the business right now -- a fabulous book with no home. The whole industry's gotten gutless. It's not about the quality of the books. It's about the marketing.
Glass or bottle?
If I was, I would sing your praises up and down the street until they put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, why didn't you tell me you were coming and bringing this handsome man? Look how I'm dressed. I've got to run and put my face on.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
Couple of wrong turns.  Thanks to Magellan, here.
You are not.
No, we're paying for the wine.
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
And get your bone smooched.
Let me call Christine.
Now we're talking.
Want some?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I'm a quick learner.
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
Count me out.
With this chick.
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct.  My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nope.
Could be anything.
Shut up.
I don't want to talk about it.
Is what the money thing?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Let's leave it alone.
I know what you need.
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.  I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
Yeah.
Quite a week.
Whatever. Sorry.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Um... yeah but it's more...
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Yeah? Like what?
Like what a fraud he was.
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Victoria.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this morning. She said she had a good time too. You should call her.
Oops. Sorry.
You golf?
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the shed. Make sure the knot's tight.
No dad!
I heard them Morgan.
Who said I was going to die?
...I will.
Are you going to do this or what?
I heard.
Yes, it was.
He's telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
How can you say that?
Can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? Give me some comfort?
I'm close.
It needs batteries.
Who wrote this book?
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Sounds like a virus.
Posse? What the hell you talking about?
What do you mean, the horses?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
...And you had to kill him?
McKendrick.
Sounds good.
Have to.
Right.
Goodbye?
Me, I'm riding along, minding my own business. Four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. I always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... don't make much difference. We get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. I guess they admired my horse. She's a great one, a sweet little bay.
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
It's not going to be easy.
Yeah?
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
What about the law?
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
And a pretty lady.
I've got no reason to run. It was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
We didn't get that far.
That ain't right.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
We'll see about that. I'm Sheriff John Langston. As you may have guessed, I am not from these parts.
Where's the dog?
I've given that up.
Yes, sir. You wouldn't believe it.
Stella, we still got an extra room out back, don't we?
Well, thanks, but forget it.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
That's the good stuff.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
Damn --  Yes -- I --  -- I'm just a little tired. Listen, Elaine, Viktor and I -- it's strictly a working relationship.  We could never be anything else.  We're just so... different.
Okay -- for you.
Excuse us.
Out of the question.  A circus like that?
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
Hair and make-up?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
That's true.
-- I can explain.
No.
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
Well, here I am.  You look pretty today.  Red suits you.
Why?
No, thank God for you, Mr. Taransky.  How many men would go to so much trouble to protect a woman?
Simone?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
You never were together, Hal.
It was more in passing.
You can't.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
Simone!
I did it, Mr. Taransky.  I licked skin.  I licked hair.  I licked every part of her.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
You know, I... don't know.
Is she here tonight?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
It's the car she drove in "Eternity Forever".
No, that was me.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I know what you're up to.
The background is.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
She looks a lot like you.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I will when you're finished writing it.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
Could they have built that hotel since yesterday?
Yes, I'd like that.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
... digitized.
You know what I'm talking about.
Do you know how important this is? This is big time.  I'm going to read it for you, doctor.
He your best buddy?
You hate him?
I don't tell her a thing.
That I'm a freak.
What if she has to pee when she's working? You think she just holds it?
You just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
I forgot myself.
What?
I told you what I want.
You believe now?
Where will you go, where no one has died?
Maybe.
Oh.
Anything bad about me?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
So who moved it?
Someone got hurt.
Standing next to my window.
What?
They used to hang people here.
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
S-ssssstop it!
J. C. Penny's?
Nope.
Nikes? What-the-hail you talkin' about?
Where'd you come from? Groupies R Us?
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
Bitch.
Which street corner?
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
I'm serious. Get this. I had a careful look at that alternator. It's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
Metaphysical question, man.
Who then, Jeremiah?? -- Who?!
Amends...?
Not while you're driving.
Dammit, Karen -- I was just... looking for your pulse.
Nothing to tell.
Still trying to figure it out myself.
This... used to be Jethro's room. The attic.
Getting ready.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
I'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
We're coming your way, man!
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Listen, you got any reports of... I don't know what you call 'em. They look like big slugs, only fast.
Do it.
Shelby! We need people out here at Cosgrove and McCammon right away!
Starla Covington. Don't be ignorant. Everyone knows that. Fucking prom queen.
Oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
Heh. It ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. Dr. Carl was just here. I had a reaction to a bee sting. He gave me a prescription. Said I should be fine, in a couple days.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
Last year, this was a new rig.
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
I never looked at it that way.  You ask a lot of questions.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
A what?
Driving, talking to me...
They're both a challenge.
Would I lie to you?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Hey...
I know.  Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
You sure do.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
No.
Go.
Can a pig whistle?
Clear and rolling.
Not for long, you ain't.
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
Do I have a choice?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
We're outta motion lotion.
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom?  Excuse me.
Then it must be a helluva idea.
Yes, sir.
So there are no guests staying on that floor?
Of course. Yes.
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
Yeah, but the Untouchables took down Capone. Heller got shot and killed. The bad guys beat him. Worse, Sparazza walked.
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
You're sure?
Three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end... if he even lives that long.
But there were more of you?
Yeah, why.
I left him a message.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
...Almost.  What do you mean "who Sparazza actually was..."
...Yeah, fifty-three.
-- We needed cohesion to move forward. Not conjecture.
-- okay, g'head --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
Fuckin' thrilled t'hear it. So the scout, the sitdown, y'musta felt it from 'em then huh?
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
You know I did baby...  And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
No doubt. That's my moms there, taught me them skills.
True?
Who, here, could possibly care what you want?  At best, you're Employee of the Month for the highest bidder in the Solaris auction.  They have no idea what's going on up here. They've never even been in space. And I'm supposed to listen to you?
What?
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
Why, who did you see?
What was it?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
Will she come back?
To who?
What is it?
Not necessarily.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
No.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Jesus...
To calm your anxiety.
To calm my anxiety.
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
All right.  How about I feel better when you take them?
He has a point.
I'm glad.
Sartorius.
When?  When I'm asleep?
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
You said he was dead.
Then you won't make it.
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Gibarian was helpless.  It's very simple: Man created the science that resulted in the discovery of Solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
Looks a little constipated to me.
Hard to find doors in this place.
Open the door, will you?
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
I don't know Tommy.
Your what...?
You got no idea...
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
Oh, some shit.
You don't want to hear about it.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Did you hear what I said?!!
You heard me.
What're you talking about --
I watched TV.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
You talked to his wife?
Discourage it.  But stay with her if you can't.  Call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  She's agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
It wasn't a bad bust.  He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
What about when she identifies him?!
Call a cruiser!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Yeah!  Seniority gets the day shift.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
I'll prove it!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
Be nice.
You stop him?
Cause if you get in a bind--
I know.
They'll never take me alive.
Harry!
I know.  I've got one too.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Well, thanks.  You wouldn't believe what I went through to get those. Right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
Can I get a word in edgewise?
Frmpph-yrr.
Hmf-hrr?
An even five I throw in the jacket.
It's too early to be clever.
Uh is a good start.
Sort of.  I'm returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. Maybe I can get my money back.
That was then.  I'm better since the lobotomy.
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
You were adorable.  The least you could do is use a glass.
He'll be fine. They won't tell me anything, but I'm sure he'll be fine.
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
I left a paper in my desk.
I was hoping you'd call, babe. Look, you got representation?
He'll try to finish his experiment.
Bonkers.
No, no!  Not there!
We did not.
Roger.
Who is it?
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes say they don't get out of the forest.
Forty-five cigarettes. The price has gone up.
There'll be no vigilante stuff. Not while I'm Barrack Chief.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Don't wear it out!
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Sefton!
You won't get off that cheap.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Nine-thirty. General von Pfeffinger should be at his desk by now. Shall we call Berlin and tell him the good news?
Naturally. It would be rather awkward to have three men in one bunk.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
I am not. According to the Geneva Convention --
Isn't it?
Some are not bad at all.
Stop it, Harry!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
Hamburger and onions! Strawberry shortcake! Gefillte fish! Banana split! French fried potatoes! Chicken a la king!
You can say that again!
I'm telling you, Animal -- these Nazis ain't Ko --
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
Yeah? How you going to fix me up with Betty Grable?
If she don't want you, she don't get anything.
You'll fix me up!
That's what I wanna hear.
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
I'll open mine, too.
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Anything else?
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Curtains would do wonders for this barrack.  You will not get them.
What radio?
Go on, Sefton -- butt out!
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
Right.
Okay, Price. You stay.
You starting that again?
He's a Nazi, Price is. For all I know, his name is Preismaier or Preissinger. Sure, he lived in Cleveland, but when the war broke out he came back to the Fatherland like a good little Bundist. He spoke our lingo so they put him through spy school, gave him phony dogtags --
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
Thirty-fifth.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
I do not want those cigarettes.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Oh! Somebody was peeking!
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
It will take a few moments for the computer to compile the information.
But I did not deal with it, sir. I let it prevent me from helping my friend.  Does that make me a coward?
No, but I'd stay out of Sickbay for a while if I were you. I still don't know why you dropped her in the water.
During the Farpoint mission. We were on the Bridge and you told a joke. That was the punchline.
I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
One minute to warp core breach.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
On screen.
What's the "Nexus"?
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Soran?
Wherever he wanted to be.
Why would you want to leave?
Please, please.
I don't need to be lectured by you. I was out saving the galaxy when your grandfather was still in diapers. And frankly, I think the galaxy owes me one  I was like you once- so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
I always do.
What about Guinan? What has she told you about me?
No, I didn't know that.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
Understood. That will be all.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
The timing is very important on my experiment- if it is not completed within the next twelve hours, years of research will be lost.
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Put me on the hailing frequency.
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
What did you see, Chekov?
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
David!... What went wrong?
There's only one thing it could be... Short range scan.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Do you have an explanation?
Your reputation is secure, Scotty.  Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'll be in my quarters.
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Sir...?
Aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
He is not himself -- but he lives. He is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
Much is at stake...
You would have done the same for me.
Why would you do this...?
You saved the ship, Spock. You saved us all. Don't you remember?!
She's to be decommissioned.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.

But, why?
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
Yes, my lord!
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
All true.
This isn't reality. This is fantasy.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
I'm not a drama critic.
'Beware Romulans bearing gifts.' Happy Birthday...
Thank you.
Computer. Request security procedure and access to Project Genesis Summary.
I got beat. We're only alive because I knew something about these ships that he didn't.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Who --
Captain, this is the garden spot of Ceti Alpha VI --
Ssssh!
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
I'm Doctor Marcus!
What?
We encoded four minutes --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
I am truly sorry.
The Admiral's son.
I don't know.
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
Raise the shields...
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
I give you sixty seconds, Admiral.
KHAN!
Chekov, who is this man?
Picture, Mr. Saavik.
I say again. This is Enterprise. Please acknowledge signal. Please --
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Midshipman First Class Peter Preston, engineers mate, SIR.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It's all we've got.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
He won't break off now. If he followed me this far he'll be back. But from where...?
Uhura, if you don't hear from us, there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.  You gentleman can remain here, or...
... No, sir. It has not.
Lieutenant, self-expression does not seem to be one of your problems.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
Erased...
If Stage Two was completed, it was underground -- she said it was going to be underground.
Aye, sir. On course to Ceti Alpha. All is well.
Stop engines.
Phasers locked...
I'll try, Captain.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
We can't all be perfect, Saavik. You must control your prejudices and remember that as a Vulcan as well as a Romulan you are forever a stranger in an alien land. Around you are humans, and as a member of the Starfleet you are unlikely ever to escape their presence or their influence. You must learn to tolerance in addition to all else I have taught you. Tolerance is logical.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Aye, sir.
I exaggerated.
Spock, start your computations for time warp.  Come on, Bones. Let's pay Scotty a visit.
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
Acceleration is no longer a constant.
Fundoscopic examination --
I have the coordinates of the reactor...
I varn you. If you don't lie on the floor, I vill have to stun you.
Shields, aye.
May fortune favor the foolish.  Mr. Sulu, Warp Speed!
The hell you were, buster. Your friend was messing up my tank and messing up my whales...
We don't want to be any trouble.
You've already been that. C'mon.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
Implicitly.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
... Who are you?
Who do you think I am?
So. There we are.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
It's all real. Look.  The storage tanks for the whales.
All I need is the radio frequency to track them.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Jim, Spock, Jim. Remember...?
Whales?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
You've programmed that from memory...?
I see.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
They have a right to be...  Do you think they'll help us?
The tank will be finished by morning...
That's cutting it closer than you know. What about team two?
<u>You?</u>  Spock, that's extraordinary.
Steady as she goes...
Advise reaching 10,000. Steer three-one-zero.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Put them on screen!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Appreciated by all, Mr. Scott.  Prepare for departure.
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
You'll work it out, Scotty. And remember: two of them.
I am well, Admiral.
Well, that's different.
Ah, what else indeed? Let me put it another way: how thick would a piece of your plexiglass need to be at 60 feet by 10 feet to withstand the pressure of 18,000 cubic feet of water?
That's the ticket, laddie.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than perception.  You explore the universe. We've discovered a single moment in time can be a universe in itself... full of powerful forces... most people aren't aware enough of the now... to ever notice them...
I am better.
Really?
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
No... I want to stay with you...
And our people?
Very good, Doctor. Picard out.
They should be quarantined before joining the ship's population.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
In six hours, every living thing in this system will be dead or dying.
Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working on several tactical plans to safely...
In stasis. La Forge is completing the diagnostic.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
It doesn't matter where he is. As soon as he realizes something is happening, he'll override my commands with one word at his com- link...
The shields in that section won't protect them against the thermolytic reaction...
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
Eject the core.
Jean-Luc Picard... my officers Doctor Crusher and Counselor Troi.
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
Why was Data assigned?
No children?
Or you could try lying down.
Let's hope so. Because if Cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
Bag him.
What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Vulcan?
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Doctor Crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
Probably from the nuclear warhead. Cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
There should be some kind of manual release...
They used copper pipes in their plumbing... so I melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  It's not the strongest alloy... but it's better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
Ignore it. We'll be fine.  Prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
Active.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
I'm afraid you've caught me. I am a space-man.
How did you know about that?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
I don't care if you're from France or Venus... just take me with you.
Fire.
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Target...
Vulcans sleep lying down...
That was the general idea I intended to convey.
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
If they're even looking for us...
Come on...
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Stand...?
That's a comfort...
He just tried to save him!
There... were no other ships in the sector.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Uhura, monitor!
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Thank you, Captain.
And your coat.
Of course not. Anyway, somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Only don't try putting words in my mouth.
You hear that?
The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
I am uncertain.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
You couldn't have known she was listening the night I dictated that entry into my log. You were proud of her achievements as a Vulcan.
I SHOULD have been -
... is to trust him.
An error.
Nevertheless.
And if they're still in place?
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Yes, sir.
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes then someone else did.
I want this ship searched from bow to stern. Lieutenant Saavik, you are in charge. Start with the transporter room and work your way outwards...
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
That was another time.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you "sad"?
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
I can see that.
Fire!
How can you be sure?
You do not look like me.
Because the captain has to concentrate on piloting the vehicle.
Like me, it has been designed with modular power sources.
Thank you.
I know how he thinks.
No!
Understood.
Aye, sir.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
New Praetor?
Wont do what, Mister Worf?
Aye, sir.
On my way. Please notify Commander Riker.
And the Romulans invade.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
The honor was mine. Captain Riker.
Praetor, we've come to Romulus on a matter we were -- assured was of great importance. If you have anything to say to us as representatives of the Federation, I suggest you do so now.
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
In time.
You're not Reman.
My life is meaningless as long as you're alive. What am I while you exist? A shadow? An enigma?
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
Why are you here?
I see more than what you are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
But you want to.
Please.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
Two ships decloaking, sir! Romulan!
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
Find her again.
FULL STOP AND FIRE !
None.
But surely...
Now go. I have some personal business.
Thank you.
Fill this out.  Will this be cash or credit card?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
No.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Oh shit!!!
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
No, we don't.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Watch it. They're coming out.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Marc Shermin.
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
What.
Steering wheel.
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
You. Mouth closed.
Okay.
You want to try it?
Three nights... two days.
I need you.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
A baby is a new person?
Why?
I do not speak English.
Yes?
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
Yes.
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
Yes. Sing some more.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
On the radio they say it's good.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
I know how to gamble now.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Goodbye.
My grandmother's rich.
Bullshit!
To the same woman?
You know that's impossible!
Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
I'd love to.  But he keeps showing up.  And you keep talking to him.  I can't have that--
I just want to see what we're like together through your eyes.
Why don't you just split?  You don't love him, anybody can see that.  And to him you're just some kinda possession, like a Ferrari, something to show the other guys.
Can't do it.
We should talk alone.
That's right.
Clips.
It's the one thing that stands between me and the jungle.
Yup.  So darn lucky.  I wake up with a .22-short floating in my brainpan, and a cop pension I can't live off of.  Good thing I wasn't any luckier.  Bobby!  Another shooter right here!
Yeah.  No, not really.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Give him the tape.  See?  It's fucking brilliant!  The tape for Faith.  I know he'll go for it.  I can set it up.
Come on!  If he gives us any shit, we kill 'em all.  Whattya say?  Just get your butt down here.  If I'm not at the shindig downstairs go to the room.  It's 2203.  You writin'?
I intend to.
Only way I could stand your ties.
That's pretty much the way it happened.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
So lay it off to somebody else.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Uh huh.  Look, Nero.  I'll make you an offer.  Take her.  Right now.  If she wants to go, if she's unhappy here, she can go.  I'll let her choose.  Faith always knows what she wants.  Hands off.  See?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Define illegal.
I've had it.  No more wirehead shit in my car.  You understand?  You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
No it doesn't.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
The gas tank's going to go any second!
It's the walk.  Something.  Anyway, they'll run your plates and get your address.  We gotta keep moving.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Yeah.  We did.
See you downtown.
Aw, Mom!
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new-- 
Besides that.
Well, the victim was killed at the turn-around over there, then his car was pushed over here...  ...right across the state line. That makes it Federal. This is Officer Wallace, he's out of Alamogordo.
That's right, Jan.
I know how the Feds like to sit on information. I got something in the car to show you.
What does the Manager say?
You heard?
What?
This is Agent Mackelway.
Just gettin' a jolt of java before headin' on home?  How does your wife feel about it?
Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Just hospital talk. Nothing that connects to Speck.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
How do you send out an APB on a dead man?
I understand.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
None taken.
Doesn't fit.
That's part of the reason I dropped by. I need to learn this stuff.
They're all criminals?
Take it to the next level. What are his fantasies, what turns him on, what kind of pornography does he like? If he could act out his fantasies, what would he do? Imagine yourself one of his victims, realizing your life is in his hands. What is he thinking?
That's because he's a fucking wacko. Never met a self-promotion scheme he didn't like. What's he doing now?
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
He's called a couple times.
You found the body. She was one of Harold Speck's victims. In El Paso.  They're not just talking to each other, Mack, they're trading souvenirs.
Not yet. This time they're waiting for you.
Murman and Imelda had been slipping into a private chat room. Low had poor old Testa drooling on the keyboard. Abduction fantasies, voyeurism, mutilation, teasing him with fetish elements. He is very good. I think it's safe to say Richard Low is Murman.
You did.
That's true.
What's up?
You okay?
Yeah, of course.
How are we going to find him?
Those were just fantasies.
[Not the heart, the watch.]
[You tell me.]
I screwed up twice, sir.
Eight, nine months ago. When I was at Computer Crime. I got into a chat room with someone named MyDick. I'd talked to him before. Everything I saw yesterday, everything in the autopsies, it's identical. The forensics are dead on. MyDick's fantasies involved a hog-tie rig, nylon cord, torture with pliers, rip the nipples -- when the "item" screams, she chokes. He had a thing about eyes, always the eyes -- stab their eyes. It's the same guy. Speck was MyDick.
350 miles.
Deputy Director Koessler doesn't want Zero. All he cares about is Low.
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Brilliant? You think he caught any of them because he was brilliant? Hardboy? MyDick? Imelda? Ripper? Think about it, how did he locate them?  He found them as Murman. And how did Murder Man find them? With sweet talk and brains? No. He did it with souvenirs. He took them into private rooms, swapped goodies: pictures, panties, jewelry, body parts. Snuff downloads. As bait. That's why I never exchanged with him. He killed girls, oh yeah, harvested them. He had the best stuff. Richard Low is Murman and Murman is one of us.
You have to put things in perspective.
You're money, baby.
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. Let me make it up to you.
You ever go to the Kelbo's? On Pico?
Yeah.
Are you sure? Maybe...
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Why? You're not a real man?
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
It does.
What what? What advantages?
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
...and even then...
You haven't told then, huh?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
...Four days..?
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Could you believe it?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
Oh... right.
Who's your booking agent?
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
Why not?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
...well, it suits you...
So I don't call either way.
Right.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
It's a gig.
Sure. Kick me when I'm down.
An eight.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Wait till summer. I swear, you can't leave the house. It hurts. It physically hurts.
Oh, like that song...
Go for it, man.
I'm such an asshole.
Wow.  You wanna grab a bite?
Coffee...  Two coffees. It says "Breakfast Any Time", right?
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
You gotta love the pirates, baby. The pirates are money.
Tee, the beautiful babies don't work Wednesdays midnight to six. This is the skank shift.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Let's go.
That was so demeaning...
She was smiling at what an asshole you are.
I know she's coming back.
I don't know...
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
No! Not the camera guy!
So, what'd you say to him? "Double down."?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.
...Whatever. It's work. You're doing what you love. What's she doing?
I hear he drives a carriage around Central Park or something.
It starts at eight...
Which one?
Minnie Pearl.
You looked right at her, baby.
Tomorrow?
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
...Is he brown?
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
...it's definitely on.
Our little baby's growing up...
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
I'm not hungry yet.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
We gotta move...
No.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
Now you've had your drink.
Maybe I can help.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
And now, what do you choose to do?
I want children, I want a family. But I don't know when.
No, I wanted other things for you.
Then why have I become a man like you?
Corleone.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Beautiful all over, eh?
Mike!
We're all tired...
OK, we sit tight until the old man can give us the lead.  But Tom, I want you to stay inside the Mall. You too, Mike, no chances.  Tessio, you hold your people in reserve, but have them nosing around the city.  The hospital is yours; I want it tight, fool-proof, 24 hours a day.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
Yes.  That's true, you're getting a hell of a reputation.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man.  What could be more important than that.
Mike, why am I out?
They're talking to themselves.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Sure.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Michael...
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Theresa.
One of them fingered the old man.
How can you be sure?
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Cut it out.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
Sollozzo and McCluskey are going to pick you up in an hour and a half on Times Square, under the big Camels sign.
Maybe.
And all his works?
I can arrange security.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
Hell, he was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  Players couldn't get a drink.
Find out anything you can...you got a Grand coming. 
Is that good?
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
Oh, it was.
Yes please!
I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive.
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Say again?
No, still here.
Sure.
Your parents met her.
Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
I can't. I can't keep spending your father's money.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Ripley's plans.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
What evening?
Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it. I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life.
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
He's gone to dinner! Search the place. I can't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Bird. That's jazz.
My fiance.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
That's a terrific idea.
And you, sir? Any better?
Why? When?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
My father wants me in New York. He builds boats. I'd rather sail them. I travel under my mother's name.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered --
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
Tell him I have a fiance, Dickie has a fiance and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them.
He's already angry, I don't think --
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
You try. You try talking to her.
Tom. Tom! Tell me, what's going on?
Hardly kissing. Kissing off.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
I can't be absolutely sure -- 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks -- but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car.
I really don't want to see anybody.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
How much to get a permit to carry?
Is there a firing range around?
Huh?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Yes?
I can believe that.
Where do you live?
That's really something.
I know. I could have picked you up.
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
The DMZ?
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
Oh. Who was that again?
Kris Kristofferson.
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
My God!
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
Just what?
With who?
This I gotta see.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
What is it? I'm busy.
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
For a fee.
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
But you're the one that wanted to get away. You're the one that came into my cab.
Do they drug you?
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
But that one night?
That fella "Sport" looks like a killer to me.
Do I look like a narc?
You just gonna leave 'em?
Well, Iris, I look at it this way. A lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. And I figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. And they hate it. So I figure the best I can do for them is not bother them at all. So I don't say a thing. I pretend I'm not even there. I figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.
You don't have to.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
Education?
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why?
You would, huh?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
What's going on?
I'm here to see Iris.
Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
The taxi life, you mean.
Like do anything, you know.
You want to talk about it?
That record company.in Nashville wants to hear my demo tape.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
MY girlfriend's pregnant.
For cottonmouth. Goodspeed and the S.E.A.L.s exchange looks.
Wrong.
What's that?  Mason?
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Damn...
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you.  This is me, Delly.  Pete Appleton. And I love you!
What did... what did I want to be?
I'm  fine.  Really.  
Oh...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
Well, there's got to be a way...
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Well, then, as what did you go?
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
I... I need a drink of water.
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
Good to meet you.  Again.
Can't wait.
Ah.
Why?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
A few.
Vultures...
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Zackly.
I guess I did.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
Thirty a month.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
I... I don't believe this.
Who the hell is this "they?"
Leo, you're my agent.  Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes!
"Ashes To Ashes?"
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
When was that?
I taught you that.
Cat.
Yeah... me too.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Yes.
If you have some, I'd...
All right. 
Then what was it?
Then why did she object to you?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
And the second?
Are you coming to my party?
Morning.
Where does he live?
It's a surprise, you see.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I need her exact name, you see.
Thank you.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
And if you don't?
I don't mind, really.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
No, you got quite a mess here, I'll admit that.  Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney  Seems a little pointless, though. Freak accident like this wouldn't happen again in a million years.  You want some help cleaning up?
Goodnight, Lydia.
I'd hold the birds for him, but I'm going away myself. Someone's got to feed them, I suppose.
What?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
When?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
What kind of law?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Oh, no you don't!
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
What did it say?
Certainly, but...
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
Without any clothes on?
Yes.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
I do different things on different days.
Like what?
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Are you staying?
Of birds?
Hear!
Hear, hear!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
After the gulls attacked.
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
I'm frightened, Mitch.
What time is it?
Wait here. Don't move.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
I have no idea.
These weren't a few birds.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much.
Which gulls, Mr. Sholes? There are several varieties.
Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I want you to help my little girl.
It is a pity.
I'm cold as ice.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
MacFarlane
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
Yes, I suppose so.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
But she must want to stand.  She must want to walk.
Well, then, Doctor MacFarlane -- although I've known a time, Toddy, when you liked the name.  Aye, and many are dead now who called you by it; rough and wild ones they were, too.  But come Toddy, sit down here with your young friend.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
You will not have it?
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
I'll not do it, Gray.
That has nothing to do with it. We've decided to do more lecturing and less dissection -- it's better for the students -- that's all there is to it.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
No, I'm not afraid. Tell! Shout it from the housetops!  And remember this -- they hanged Burke -- they mobbed Hare -- but Dr. Knox is living like a gentleman in London.
This is a gift you'll not return.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Another little drop'll never do you any harm.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
Or what? You'll bleed all over my carpet?
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
You sent them. I had no choice.
Keep that thing away from me.
I don't know you, man.
What happened to your leg there Officer? Hunting accident?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I was talking about you.
You killed Lauren! You killed her!
When Lauren was missing the police came to our house. They said they were looking for her, right?  But I know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
My father.
I used to be so proud of him. My big deal daddy. And now, he's just a crook. Worse even. And the weird thing is...
I know.
Good for you. You do know something.
Just hold on to me.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
He'll be there at 8:30.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
No -- not at all.
What about your personal safety in the meantime? What about the Army -- and the police?
I followed Mr. Carpenter -- right after you left -- and, gee, Mom, where do you think he went? Right into the space ship!
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
Well -- there are several ways to reduce landing speed. You see, the velocity--
No -- I'm afraid not.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
How does he explain that?
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
You know about the United Nations?
Well, we could--
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
Is it real?
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
How do you know?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Did you believe what he told you?  I have a reason for asking this -- a very important reason.
There's no limit to what he could do. He could destroy the Earth.  If anything should happen to me, you must go to Gort. You must give him this message: "Klaatu barada nikto." Please repeat that.
In this case the secret wouldn't be worth much. He doesn't know the answer himself.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
Maximum body-count.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Good idea.  Marko.  We're hungry.
Where's Star, David?!
I can't do that!
Hit the lights again.
Chill out Edgar.
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
'Again'?  Dad... you haven't had company in this house since Mom died eight years ago.
Good!
Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
You better not like him too much.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Gotta go, Mom.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Can we go now, huh? LUCY Maybe later.  Grandpa's expecting us.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
So what can I help you find tonight, Lucy?  We've got it all.  Best selection in Santa Carla.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I know, I've felt it...
Okay.  I'll flip you for it.
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
Don't bother.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
I don't know.
I... I don't feel any differently.  Do you?
Just listen.
Screw it, I'm going up anyway.
What was he doing in the rec room?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
Watch him close.  Ask him why he didn't kennel the dog.
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
What's it going to do, being a plant?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
He's gone already!  Do it!
We got morphine, don't we.
You're a dead man, MacReady -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
Well, get to it.
Well, stick to it.
No.
You're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
What for?
You know damn well what we both make of it.
Who else could have used that key?
What?!
What else can they do?
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
No...
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Send him away.
This is the way in?
This way.
End...?
This has to end.
I don't understand.
I will...
Well, Alexander, as a fellow scientist I know you have a thousand questions --
No, we created the Morlocks.
As our bodies atrophied our minds... compensated.
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
It's always the tiger for you, Alexander, haven't you learned that by now?...
I know.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
Well, much obliged -- I'm always forgetting the confounded brake -- say, if you wait until I get her up and running I'll give you a perambulation.  Tell you all about her.
Next time then.  We perambulate here most every night.
You know I can't.
What?  Yes -- Orion -- good fortune -- sailors.
Holding you... again.
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
What?
Oh?
What is it?
I would.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Your husband is dead?
That machine --
I will...
Don't then have stars where you come from?
Good night.
Yes!
We share everything.
I don't understand.
How do you decide?
Oh, very much...  ... I used to work somewhere in that direction, I think.  A huge university where we taught everything from botany to history to literature.
Only to keep warm.  For illumination we had gaslights on most of the streets and a new invention called electrical lighting that made it seem like daylight all through the night.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Looking back... I suppose it was. I didn't quite realize it at the time but...
You lost someone.
Someone you loved very much.
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
If you only knew...
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
What's the matter with -- ?  -- What would I do without you, Mrs. Watchit?
Exactly correct, sir.
No, sir --
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
For our sake, I hope not.
No, sir.
What about Starks?
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
[Pointedly] Of course you're not.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
I don't give a shit about your patient!
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
I don't understand...
I thought you said you never knew your father.
I never touched your father! I swear!
They should just be looking harder.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
I can't take you out of here in your condition...
No, it hasn't.
What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
[Beat] What's your name?
Yeah, I'll hitch a ride or something. [Beat] Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel.
How?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
I might not be able to.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
Then why isn't there anyone around?
How?
[Beat] We will.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
NO! They're not my delusions! Look, just leave my business with Becker to me!
You have nothing to fear, William.
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
So what am I supposed to do?
You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
Is it true?
I'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border.
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
No, it's fine. [Beat, swallow] Thanks.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. [Beat] She died young.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon?
Go fuck yourself.
Umm, yes.  She was driving.
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Yes, sir.  I know.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Alright.
Right.  Where are they?
What's wrong?
Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
No, for that much money I have to tell them exactly which office.  I know, I've had to have money wired to me on the road.  And there has to be a code word or they won't give it to you.  I'll have to tell you the code.
Friend of mine, owns a club.  Dickie Randall.  You'd know him if you saw him.  His brother was in your class. Terry.
Who is it?
Okay, okay, just tell me what's the trouble.
You didn't see that one comin', did ya?
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
Yeah!
West.  Left.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
Yes, now that you mention it.  You seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.
But it wasn't!  We got away!  We were walkin' away!
You're right.
Yeah.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Like a Chihuahua?
Please, God, please don't let us get caught.  Please, please, please...
About how fast was I going?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Just asking.
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
You're drivin'.
What?!
Way up ahead!
Fuck you.
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
Yeah... sure did.
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
Nah.
Never?
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Whatever happened to Mary?
Yeah, right.
You're kidding? What did they say?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Flew.  Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Because you're a loser, and in some warped way this gives you a momentary sense of worth.
Healy, what I just tell you?
Dumbshit.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
What's that?
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
-- Love story of our time.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
What?
Nah, really, it was moronic.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
Uh-huh.
Any idea where I might start looking?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she's married?
Nope. Never been.
Oh, uh, I resigned.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
You were following us?
Huh. That sounds great.  Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Oh, are you on the team?
Huh?
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
We've got a lot in common.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Yeah, sure.
What do you mean?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Admiral, I asked you a question.
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretary. The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones.
Tomorrow...
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
He better. Because nobody thinks he's up to this. Nobody.
Smoke.
Cuba.
No it isn't. They don't trust the people that feel this way. But these people are right. And the Kennedys are wrong.  We need you to tell 'em, Kenny. They'll listen to you.
You know I don't mean they're weak.
This is from the Highest Authority?
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
I'll be evacuated with the President.
Back to work.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Then we need to do a few things right away. No Pierre. He knows, the press knows. You're going to have to keep up your schedule -- your movements are followed too closely. And we need to get these guys out of the White House. George Ball's got a conference room at State.  Reconvene over there this afternoon, come back here tonight.
I don't know. I don't know.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
And we can't purge the Chiefs. Our invasion talk will look like a bluff. Or even that there's been an attempted coup.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Tell him, Ray.
-- did you understand me when I said that --
Jesus...
Beats the hell outta me.
I already did.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
A long way from home. You be careful out there.
Ray. I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.
She's that subtle?
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
No way, Cooch.
Watch out!
Bullshit.
To us Indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I've got seven mothers on this reservation. Sisters. Brothers. You ain't one of them.
And...
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
He's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth. He's not gonna come out without a fight.
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Ray.
I'm from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know about the other world, Ray.
I desecrated it?
What the fuck you talkin' about?
They sent me here, Richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth.
I blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how I know! Now you're gonna say I didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
I could be, too.
I'm with someone.
Two meters.
Too aggressive?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
You're horrible
What?
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
. Yeah!
Yesterday.
What kind of games?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Well what?
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
Don't tell me okay. Do it!
I know!
Swell! Passing ten thousand!
What do you want?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
I want him!
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
IT'S MY SHOT.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
Helping him in.
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
Yes sir!
A good man. Good flyer.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
I called your house.
I know.
Over there man.
And you get a kickback.
Identification?
Thank you.
Fuck you.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Who gives a shit what you believe? In thirty seconds, you'll be dead. Then I'll blow this place up...
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Because I've got the greatest job in the solar system.  As long as the turbinium keeps flowing, I can do anything I want.  Anything.  If fact, the only thing I ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
But I thought...
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
Looks like another schizoid embolism.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Not since you lost him.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
I don't know.
Oh, Rekall.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Come on!
Anywhere!  Go!..Just go -- OH SHIT!! SHIT!!
Lori, move.
Some men just tried to kill me!
No!  Spies or something.  And Harry from work...Get down!
Let me finish!
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
The hell you're not.
You sure you don't wanna...?  For old time's sake.  If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
It's time you found out.
Bullshit.
Okay, you're the boss -- Mars it is.
How real does it seem?
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
Melina, Hauser sent me to do something.
Like what?
People are dying, Quaid!!  Stop!!  We've got to get air!!
Burt, can you hear me now?
You know, Val went to that college, too.  For a whole year.  Couldn't quite sit still for it, though. Had too much vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he'll be one in a million.
VAL, STOP!  THEY'RE COMING!  DON'T MOVE!
Nope, there!  That's one.
I keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Do not talk to the driver.
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Val!  Val!
Relax.  A snake thing like that couldn't move too quick.
Me, too.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
Not going to pole vault anywhere. That's for sure.
<u>People</u>?  Hell, <u>National</u> <u>Geographic</u>.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
You okay?
Where's the nearest hospital?
Sustained.
Your Honor: I imagine that, no matter how careful my questioning, Mr. Ortega would, in his well-intentioned way, dig my client's hole even deeper.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
Yeah, well I had reasonable cause to believe the judge might've heard of the Fourth Amendment.
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
"Cecil Stipe"? Have we seen any affadavit with that name?
What, the lunatic who --
George is a fucking burnout case. I didn't want him on the stand anyway. Get more names from Billy.
I'm not that desperate.
Let's get a cab.
Least we'd already be at the Morgue.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
Neither.
It hasn't been that long.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
I lied.
I don't have time to read every word in every report, I'm too busy getting killed in court... Meantime my crackerjack investigator can't find the goddam art supplies store where Chuckie-fucking-Roeder works!
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I don't need sleep!
Want to tell me what went down here?
Exactly what happened then?
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
Hey, Chinese people have this energy field that vibrates at a particular frequency.
Shu Kai Kim.
The great personal sacrifices endured by Mr. Reynard have no bearing on the legal issues, your Honor -- !
And who were the detectives who assisted you, Mr. Reynard?
The same three detectives on the Jimmy Chin case.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
No? Then what did he say?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
That's right.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
"Materiel"? What do you mean by that?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
No shit...  We killed a guy for baby laxative.
Bobby...
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
Someone else has it now.
Any friends?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Thanks.
That's what I heard.
Cole said she was 17.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
Of course...
No, I want to smoke.
No, you're the muffin.
How did the car get back here?
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
You know what that Big "E" stands for? Big Ed's Gas Farm.
What'll it be?
You got it.
Send me a kiss.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
No.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Dad...
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Oh, Leland.
This is serious. Mr. Benjamin Horne's got a delegation of Norwegians coming in next week and I want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. Sarah, you first.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
What did he find?
How good's your intelligence?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
...tell me about this case.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Yes. It would be.
...a Mrs. Doneghy called... I told you that.
Yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
How is that?
How old are you?
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
That's right.
Tell us.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...I made a detailed physical examination of the patient, Sir, yesterday evening, I...
Yes.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
I'm sorry...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
What are they going to do? Not invite me to their Birthday party...?  Look, I gotta go. I have to be in Cambridge...
...the case with anyone. And I'll meet you Tuesday, and we'll go over your testimony...
How old is he?
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
And did you write the numeral 'one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Thank you for seeing me.
Listen to me, fella...
Really. How wonderful for you.
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
I think I will.
Do you want me to go...?
I... do you want me to leave?
Well, maybe you better do that, then.  You know you guys are all the same. You don't care who gets hurt. You're a bunch of whores. You'd do anything for a dollar. You got no loyalty... no nothing... you're a bunch of whores.
Yes. Yes, I have.
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
Where is he?
Uh...
...hey, I don't need your charity...
I have to try this case. I have to do it, Mick. I've got to stand up for that girl. I need your help.  Mick, will you help me...?  Will you help me...?
No.
Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight?
They still have to take it to a jury.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
The Doctors.
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
We, we were rather busy...
Me, too.
Wait a minute - wait a minute!.... Bombs don't unscrew.
Darnedest thing I ever saw - the way that's unscrewing!
We'd be in all the papers!
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Like...ah...
I might have recognized you without the beard.  And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
It's gone now.
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
Can I read it?
No biggie, really.
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
These look quite fresh.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
What?
The mean old man with the claws.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
A story?
Call it a guess...
Really?  Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams?  Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere.  Even at Mass.
You got it.  What's happening?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
What are you talking about?
I'm afraid there was an accident.  It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma'am.
I want to see for myself.
Captured?  How?
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is one person.  A gatekeeper, so to speak.  Someone Freddy's got to get by before he can enter our world.  It's you, Heather.
Now that you have a child, is it possible you've decided horror is bad for children?
Do you let your child watch your movies?
My child?  No...but...
They've become what you wanted. They're a crew.  That's why he came.
I haven't forgotten.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes sir.
How old are you, son?
Thank you.
Yeah, sure.
No, I can't.
Rick March.  Who the hell are you?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
It's not a vacation, it's private school.
Why then.
I guess.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
How do you know?  They might.
Kennet Square, PA.  'Mushroom capital of the world'.
I can't make it out?
Yes sir.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
No.
Oh, on the contrary, the Albatross is considered a very good omen.  It is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  It's very bad luck if you kill one.  And dolphins too.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Happily, it all worked out... This time.  Bill, take Philip below and help him find a bunk.
No.  Look, it's me okay?  Can't it just be about me?  For once?
We're short one long boat too.  Come on.
They'll know about it in the morning.
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
What is it... the secret?
But, they don't speak English.
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
No way Phil.  Not like this.
Sorry won't cut it.
I don't know...
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
For killing a dolphin.
The Coast Guard 'Eagle'.  She never lost a race while you were Skipper.
The papers are going to eat you alive.  Even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  They want someone to be accountable.
How old are you?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
You heard from Reggie?
You hitched yet?
No sir...
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
You ain't actin', mama.
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
Didn't he say somethin'?
And you never told nobody about it?
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
What'd you say to her?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
We'll find out in a hurry.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Told you not to call your mama.
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
I'm afraid she is, baby.
You sick?
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
What could I be up to, Lula?
Lead the way.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
SAILOR!!!!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Take care of him?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Yes.
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Yeah... But I did... And I told you all about it...
He was trying to steal my car!
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
Yeah. Like in Against All Flags. Only they use a couple big hams.
You're stoned.
Sara and Walter declined. Guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
No. Not yet he isn't.
Huh uh. A jockey. His name's, um, Curtis... Curtis Hardapple.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
James? My James? What's happened?
Maybe... I don't know.
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
It seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
Don't touch it.
Such as.
Uh huh. So. We find Vernon, we find the car. We find the car...
That was MacCaulay.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
It's mine.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Relax, Vernon...
Stop calling me Vernon.
Heaven?
The one she wore on her wedding day?
I guess. Walter never tells Sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
What are we going to do with...
You're welcome.
What'd he say?
Yes.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Hm.
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Amazing.
Kinship.
You can see the outline of a butt.
Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
You're mad at me, aren't you?
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Jealous? Of me?
I never said that.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
When?
Near Carvel?
I'm sorry about all that. I just -- I don't like to talk about my family. They treat me like a freak.  She makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. It's mine. My parents left it to me.
I think so... What about you?
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
James'll know about George Sanders.
I thank you.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Grady!
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Crabtree? He doesn't even know James.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
It's -- it's a souvenir. Of Baltimore.
I love you, Grady.
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
No. I mean. Well, actually, yes. Sort of. I don't remember. Listen, Sara, I have to tell you something.
What's he doing out there?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
GRADY Tripp. English Department.
I... I...
I don't know. It might be...
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
And?
I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
I might have his number on campus.
That's all right. We'll find him.
No, I'm going ho --
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
You'd recognize it if you tasted it.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
When can I see her?
Only if it's no closer than a hundred feet.
It was a beautiful present.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Then what? What?!
I made that table for you and Annette, for your wedding. I put a lot of love into it.
What's that?
Early July.
Did you ever... Do you have feelings for Anna?
It's hard to describe.
It's a bright sound.
That was terrific.
You should hear the bird.
Doesn't everybody?
Do you believe in them?
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
Woodsman?
You're a cop. Figure it out.
It's a free country, isn't it?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
I'm twelve.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Robin?
Yes?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
What?
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
That's right.
No fucking way.
Good. That's an honest answer. And why don't you like coming here?
I don't feel anything.
Have to talk about something.
I'm not afraid. I'm just saying that Carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he isn't careful he's going to suffer.
Is that what you are angry about?
That is a marvelous image, Walter. Because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
I couldn't say.
You couldn't say.
What is your idea of being normal?
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
What did you think would happen?
What did you want to happen?
That's my answer.
I'm relaxed.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Nothing. Can I open my eyes?
I don't see --
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
What else?
I feel... okay.
What?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
What?
Since you've had sex?
Because I like you.
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I know.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
Prove it.
Do what?
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Kirkhill?  That guy doesn't know his butt from a rathole.  Hey, Perry!
No!  I'm okay now.  I just don't... I can't go any further in.
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
What about O-2?
The storm's gonna last longer than 12 hours.
Yeah?  Well I'm not.
I'm telling you what is there.  You're just not hearing.  The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan.  There's something down there.  Something not... us.
No.
It's trying to communicate.
You noticed.
Yeah, but it's gonna take them a while to find us.  We better get this flooding stopped.
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
WHAT KIND OF PLAN IS THAT!??
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
I've been better.  Next time it's your turn, okay?
Yuh?
Just checking is out, huh?  How come?
Just hold your water, okay?  So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Wait for what?
I'm thirsty.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
I understand very well. Only I don't want any rash assumptions to be made.
And you say that came from Lisca Bianca?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them...
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
You must know your third grade geography book inside out.
Who's moving?
What has everybody got against me this morning?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
And what did they say about me?
Ah, no... For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
And do you remember where she got off?
Early? Is four in the morning early for you?
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Through someone else?
Who?
Because...
Oh my dear child.
I burnt them.
Yes, Mother.
What do you mean?
Let's talk about something else.
Right now?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Why should they?
And what did you do?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Somebody told her.
Who?
You'll laugh.
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
I'm not sick.
I breathed!
I can't.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
And why am I here?
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
No.
Because I wasn't worthy.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Yes.
I hate him...
Who?
I put her to sleep.
Larry there's got to be something missing.
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
I'll have it.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Marie brings me icecream too you know. Chocolate... my favourite.
Not any more... now I like chocolate.
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
What business is it of yours..?
You can call me Sister.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
She stopped eating completely...
About two years before.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
The Catholic Church...
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
Oh, some time in January.
The sheets...
Don't deny it!
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
What have we done to hurt you?  And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do?  Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh?  You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Mary Magdelen?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Become?  One is born a saint.
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
My God, but you're determined.
Yes.
And the baby.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Eh?
Hoop, this isn't a hoop, it's a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?
Oh, it's all right.
I'm a deserter, too.
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
They'll be here.
That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?
Sorry? 
Oh, my God, he's a natural.
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
Get him out of here!!
You crawler.
Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
What's that mean?
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
And what do you do about it?
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Parading?
So you <U>are</U> a man after all.
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Nothing good.
What's he on about?
Hello.
Oh, well that's all right.  What?
A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
Well, it may be a joke, but it's his nose. He can't help having a horrible great nose, it's the only one he's got. And his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
Here, Pauly.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
That's right, but he's only asking us to pay attention to him, aren't you?
Please, can I have one to surge with?
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
Oh do I? You're the first one who ever said that.
Is it?
Aye, but you know him well.
No I don't, he's only a casual acquaintance.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Do I have to raise me voice?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Who?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
That's too easy for Lennon.
Yeah, It's all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. He's probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Hell, no!  We don't know what's down there on that piece of rock!  It might be dangerous!  What we should do is get on the radio to the exploration authorities... and let them deal with it.
What's the terrain down there?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
Has the hull been breached?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
I didn't say it was bad for you, it's just kind of sickening, that's all.
Is it alive?
Damn it!  How long to fix?
What?
No, we can't afford to lose that much oxygen.  We're going to have to flush it out.
Right.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
<u>How</u>?
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
We sure need this flamethrower.
Thanks for the thought. 
Well... this rock rotates every two hours.  The sun should be coming up in about 20 minutes.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Can you see anything?
We're just plain lucky.  That could have gone right through the hull -- taken <u>weeks</u> to patch it.
We'll have to trap it somehow.  If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.
Are they close?
Let's get moving with this net.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Computer, you have signalled a priority three message.  What is the message?
Found what?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Is that its mouth?
Okay.  First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
Now.  If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
Kablooey.
The head's okay, but I could sink a six-pack.
Yeah...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Okay, give me the numbers.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
Quick!  Run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
Keep trying!
What?
I'm picking up another signal.
Where does that lead to?
Sounds great.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Done it already.  Nothing matches.
Right.  When you've done that, don't waste any time getting out of there.  Once that crane starts moving...well, it's bound to provoke some kind of response.
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
I... I can't!
Yeah, 'Good Evening' to you, too.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
Eddie...
You take charge.
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
Frankly - yes.
You know me better than that.
What else?
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
It is possible - even conceivable - that you've confused me with that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on - that you have the same contempt for me that you have for them?
Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm nobody's fool. Least of all - yours.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
That's not true!
No, it's not.  It's for this.
This answer satisfies me a hundred percent.
Margo.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
We have that in common.
I refer to your new and unpregnant understudy. Eve Harrington.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Is it sabotage, does my career mean nothing to you? Have you no human consideration?
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
I'll try.
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Many happy returns of the day...
Okay.
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
For instance what?
I mix what I like.
What a body, what a voice.
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
Paranoiac!
Margo, let's make peace.
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
Hear, hear...
A cowboy.
Just wondered what?
Why you have to go out there.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
Every day.
You didn't have to tell me.
Of course not.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
Now you want an argument.
Like an agent with one client.
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I might.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
You rest. I'll get it...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
I'd like that.
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
I won't forget.
I wish I could believe that.
Every performance? Then - am I safe in assuming you like it?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
They're your fans, your audience-
Three or four miles...
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Eve.
Now just a minute!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
Such as?
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
She was a revelation...
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
The audience will want its money refunded, believe me.
That's right, but I don't understand-
I placed...?
I just played it.
"Liebestraum."
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
Are you breaking the contract?
Answer my question!
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
--read 'em both and you'll see--
I was sure trying.
Well, Barker tried to get blueprints of the Miami Convention Center and the air-conditioning system.
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
It makes sense; Hunt worked for the C.I.A. and the White House was paranoid about Teddy Kennedy.
--almost every source we've used has been Republican, this guy's a card- carrying Democrat.
--Haldeman I know, who else?
Dwight Chapin, Nixon's appointments chief--he knew Segretti in school. Maybe I'm crazy, but this is the first time any of this starts to make sense. What were the three theories?
Now the reason no one believed the Republicans is because there wasn't any reason, they were so far ahead. But Segretti was talking to these other lawyers a year before the break- in.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
--jeeeeeeesus--
11:30.
Listen, I've got a dinner--can't we do this tomorrow?
The telephone calls... we know about that.
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
--Teddy Kennedy?
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
I told you, he had to go out on a case.
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
--Deep Throat?--
If they ever start calling us goddamn liars--  --it's time to start circling the wagons.
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
Lot of pressure at the Star.  Carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. That may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.  How much did the damn bike cost?
There's always a later plane.
This girlfriend of mine at the Committee, the other day she went back to the D.A. to tell the things the FBI didn't ask her. That night, her boss, he knew what she'd done. They control everything; that's how they know it all.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
The ones who could disburse the money.
Gordon Liddy, you mean?
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
--you double-checked both sources?--
I don't know titles.
--I'm not here.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
You're a lawyer and you're here--
Where?  What do you mean, where?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Ratfucking.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
Howard Hunt here.
--absolutely--and that's all they do, sit sit sit--every once in a while, they call up a Senator, some reporting--
That's everything Bachinski had, I think it's worth following up.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
As a rough rule of thumb, as far as I can throw Bronco Nagurski, that's how much I trust John Mitchell...
That was awhile ago.
--political, personal, sexual, anything at all against Mitchell?--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
I won't talk about the other two.
The what to what?
Well then keep it coming.  Alright, people, good work!  Keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Finch!  Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Whatever you hear about me, you agree.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
What?  No I'm not.
So you're going to Michigan?
You want onions?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
You called me Oz.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
That's not why we're going out.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
You mean...and orgasm?
Of course.
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Yeah, enormous.
I don't get it.  How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
It's not what it looks like!
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Yes.
I know.  Hey Nadia.
I told you.
Okay, I get it.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
You've got something going?
Okay.
Move with the music.
Can't what?  Do you not want to be with me?  I wish to be entertained, James.
God dammit, Stifler!
Kevin, this is serious!
Not for you.
Okay.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah, right here.
I want to hear you say it.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
Whoop, you're fading out.  Good luck at that party.
That's the spirit.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Stifler!!
Would you shut up?
But you better hurry.
What a coincidence, I am someone!  Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Yeah. Apparently.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
No it isn't! You're dead!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
Where?
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Before the coma!
What about me?
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
What?
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
Uncle Terrence.
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
I can't! At midnight tonight, he will kill again. It's crazy!
But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
I'm sorry. . .  I'm. . .
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
That's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
Why?
It's the best fork of all
The dessert fork!
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Don't be
I'm glad you	did too.
I'll never let go!
Don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
And this is my future. This is who I am!
No, I really like my tongue... we're very attached.  Oyyyy... Okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
That was your dinner!  I do hope there is no cabbage in Paris!
Look!
What a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'Your Highness".
What do you mean?
Dmitri ... You must understand that once you take her to Tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. She's a princess and you're a commoner.
Remove him at once.
Alvy Singer over here!
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Oh, you do?
Huh?
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Oh, I see, I see.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Yeah?
Oh, all right.
Oh.
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
Here, you want some?
I tried to take my pants off over my head...  ...my ear.
Yeah?
M'hm.
You don't want me to live with you?
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
No, I'm fine.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
Yeah.
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Will it change my life?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
How can you say that? I mean,  who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
I'm nauseous.  Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
This is the first book that I got you.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
This is my room.
Step up here!
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Don't get upset!
Oh, you got a headache!
Are you?
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
Who said that?
Key word here is "indulgent."
Tell him.
May I see your license, please?
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
What difference does that make?
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
His wife has diabetes!
They're persecuted enough!
Oh, God, you should've seen what I looked like then.
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Well, yeah, you always look pretty, but that guy with you...
You think so? Do you really?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Hey-
I was very charming.
It has your ring.
She's got great tits.
With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them.
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors.
October-ish.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Didn't I say?
Oh.
Whatever you like.  I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  Are you alright, Clair?
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Oh, very jealous.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
Monica.
Excuse me?
You have?
Well it's fucking time.
Are you my big hard hero?
Hm.  We should do it again.
They didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
It was fifteen seconds.
We've only been over this how many times?
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
There's still time to undo this.
Did he promise?
Scout's honor.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Beats a lawsuit.
Accept a compliment.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I'll say as little as possible.
Panes is not on your team anymore.
Okay, knock it off.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
And how hard it hit?
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Yes.
Ah...
Will you make love with me?
I'll do it.
Lovely.
Don't I find what?
He's the best dog in the world.  They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea.
Oh.  You're serious.
Sally did all this herself?
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
And Ryan works at home.
I'll be your best friend.
Let's go for a walk.
I'm sorry.
Nine...nine, yes?  Nine years, just about.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual...
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
God willing.
Excuse me?
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
What?
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
Do Peter Sellers again.
Would you, like, marry him?
Are you asking me to marry you?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I'm worried about your Galiano.
Yes.  Fine.
Um.  Happy for you.
So tell me, how's it going?
We're going to have to go back out there.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  You don't trust anyone.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
Very well.  Carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
You're right!
Aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
How dare you speak to me like that? I'm the Princess!
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
That's not a name!  That's just a letter!
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  The night we danced.
Well, "trouble" is my middle name. Actually, my  middle name is .985, but I don't tell people.  Hey, Bala, I...I actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
And do Princesses do improper things?
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Duty calls!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
Royal victory party?  Will...will Princess Bala be there?
Oh, of course --
ARREST HIM!
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
I'll take your suggestion under advisement, Princess.  In the meanwhile --
I'm not in the mood.  Even when they're off work, they follow orders.
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
One napkin, coming up.  I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Fine.  Wait.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
No. Like a man.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
Three.
Why?
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
Let me help you.
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Sure.
I'm not very good at it.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Gin.
Who'd care?
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Are you supposed to?
In this house, you're supposed to.
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
You ought to see my backhand.  And wait till I serve the meatballs. 
Fine.
I never thought he'd do it.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
In there.
Seven --  -- queen.
Mr. Dobisch said that?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You do?
What kind of joint are you running?
Are you going to deny it?
I'm not through with you yet.
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
I am?
Not that I have anything to hide.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Yes, sir -- I understand.  She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you?  Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
You're going to take her off my hands?
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
What does he mean, accident?
You?
Who else?
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Oh, I'm very grateful.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
You threatening me?
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
No.
Not particularly.
No.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
You know I liked it better long.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
I never said goodbye, Fran.
That's enough, Fran.
You're not being funny.
I wasn't trying.
Handle what?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I promise.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Stop that, Fran.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It's a thought.
Yeah --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We need all our fuel.
What !
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Esprit de corps --
No.
I go up on missions. Listen Captain, buy me all the beer you want, but you better tell that asshole over there you're not going to find out anymore about me.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens.
Why they call you that?
That we're dumber than we look.
Shot himself. What for ?
Clear on starboard -- Where's Lance an' the Captain?
Terminate ?
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
No, it'd be spooky without the war -- give 'em back.
Charlie?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I don't know. He was a lame, that's all.
Entirely unnecessary, Captain.
Looks like a two thousand pound to me. Yeah, a two thousand pound bomb.
We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Your daughter.
Sure -- fine --
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
No. They put out two or three for every one I needed. When you get to the one you'll use, you just stake it out. If something feels wrong, you just pass it up. On one mission, I had to pass up three and ended up living on rats and chocolate bars.
What about this point here?
You came up my river -- in that small boat. So simple. I always thought the final justice would come from the sky, like we did.  You are the final justice, aren't you?
What Truth?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
And you admired him?
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
You think he'd of shot us?
No -- leave it --
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind.
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
No. Not really.
What's a big question?
But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.
C'mon --
134  CONTINUED:  
So they can patch me up and put me in a cage?  Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur.  Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land.  Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
Oh.
Wasn't my intention to hurt Wilder.  I'm telling you the truth.  I liked the man.  I only meant to get loose... to survive. Your cheechako boyfriend better understand that.  Listen, I've got some money put away --
I bet you haven't had lunch.
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
I'll wear it for you.  And I can wear it when we go home.  We won't be here forever.
I'll tell you everything later.
My home is here.  With you.
Relax.  I just want to ask them how the hunting is.
New to the country, kid?
A daughter in Oregon.
With light clothing and no supplies, this is nobody's territory.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
I'm still figuring: You're either real brave or real dumb.
Yeah?
Where's my ELT?
You got one?
Shut up!

Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
What are you talking about?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
This isn't your concern.  It's over, here and now.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm a waitress.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Will you please take it?
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
What are you doing here?
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
Carol the waitress?
Yes.
Note. Put it in the note.
Why did yo do this for me?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
What you did changed my life.
Lovely.
My son.
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Never.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
The two might go together.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
No!!!
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
You changed the room around...
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Last word freak.
Terrify me?
Absolutely.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
What's he look like?
Well, that's a load off.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
Okay, then.
Thank you for walking him.
Get out.
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Oh, my gosh.
Got any easier questions?
You consider your life easy.
I give you that one...  Nice packing.
I'm going back with you.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
You can't --
How long have you been freelance?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Oh, yeah.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Freelancer.  A woman.  Surveillance specialist.
Fuck you, fuck Cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
It cost us.
He stole another contract.
Who the fuck are you?  Who do you work for?
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
You didn't know anything about me.
An assassin?
Until a minute ago.
Why?
And you want to use me to get him?
Forget it!
He will know everything about you. Everything.  I know, because I've done it.  Once you've been inside a mark's home, you're in their head. If you're any good, you'll find the mark in a week, and Bain is good because I was the best and I couldn't take him.
Electra.
This is crazy.  I can't trust you. You can't trust me.  How can we possibly help each other?
The C.I.A.?
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Why not?
No.  Just the first one.
You said you didn't trust it.
About?
Nothing.
You were there?
Yes.
Here?
Really?
They saw you coming a mile away.  If I had known we'd be using --
Then, we wait.
He won't be able to.  He'll have to go inside.  He'll have to see with his own eyes, whether or not I am there.  If the bank closes, he won't know for sure.  He'll come.  I'm sure.  And when he does you'll go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
What did he want?
He wanted what I want now; to get out of the business.  To disappear to some empty Greek island.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
They're worth less points.
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Are you attracted to me?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
She was taken.
I know.  That's why I'm attracted to you.  I mean, you make me nervous. You're intimidating.  Maybe it's my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all I can really think about right now is kissing you.
I waited another four minutes.
What?
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
Are you asking me if I believe in another life?
Taken.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
No.
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
He was an electrician?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
You're nuts man, Katka's right!
I've been saying that since we met.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Can you do the lock on it?
Don't we have enough already?
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Yeah, I'll take some.
No, for the Asylum.
So why didn't we?
Who put a bee up your butt?
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
No, We aren't going to do it.
I fell in love.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
What happened?
WE gotta think of something.
So?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
That one?
Follow that Budjovice sign.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I've been around.
Ooh, well excuse me.
You're everything a guy could want.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
Let's have a look anyway.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Yo, dobree!
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
Well she sure isn't normal.
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
That's not what you said last night. And, I didn't bring that "prick" Josh.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
How do I know this isn't a trap?
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
A drill, what are you up to?
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Subtitles) You have made many mistakes Pavel, let there be no more, for your sake.
Why not?
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Thanks.
No. I won't be long.
That'd be something.
Later.
Were?
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Do you think I'm strange?
Looking for something -- someone.
I don't want to be just your friend --
You.
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
Hoped for it.
What are you going to -- ?
Where? Why?
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
Yes.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Like what, sir?
Getting by.
Yes.
I'd do that --
When do I get time for me?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Yeah.
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
Yes, sir!
Third time they've been out there this week.
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Fine.
But he didn't ask me.
Marty, you haven't been listening. Nobody's asked me to the dance...yet.
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
Uh, yeah, well, believe me, I sure feel like I know you!
You mean like how you're supposed to act with someone on a first date?
What drill?
Not now....
Okay, then!
And where am I gonna be?
Why what?
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Local calls cost five cents. What number do you want?
What's this all about?
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Sure, he agreed quickly.
A mall?
What if you lost your keys?
I don't know, but I don't want to take any chances! Now you stay here and don't do anything. Don't answer the door, don't answer the phone, don't go outside. Understand?
You did what?!?
Jesus!
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
It could happen at the moment you arrive back in the future, theoretically, it could happen at the moment of your birth...or conception. Actually, it could happen at any time. It's a question to which I hope we'll never learn the answer.
A car.
Gone?... Where?
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
What's going on?
Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
For coming onto my property... With a gun.
What for?
Nothing.
Quit my job.
Great.
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Okay.
What?
But it would hurt.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
Just looking.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
I'm serious.
No.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
Who're you?
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Planet 10?
Same one you had yesterday?
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!
Now, Buckaroo Banzai?
To get my guns.
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
He offered you money?
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
No, I don't.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
You don't wanna know.
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.
No!  Ditto the professor-
Please, Barton.
Really?...
Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such a... Thank you.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 'EM! DROWN 
...Who?
Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Are you all right?
Ever act?
Who?
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well I...
Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a souse!
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man  from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and  and  and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and  well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Defense against what? Insurance? Something they need? Something they should be thanking me for offering? A little peace of mind?...
Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
I guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
What do you think happened?
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help 
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let YOU run the the studio. It doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run THIS particular asylum. So let's put a stop to THAT rumor right now.
Yeah.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Ya see how he's not writing it down?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Excellent picture.
Mr. Lipnik, please 
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
Why didn't you tell me?
Who?
Sometimes I really hate you.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
Yes.
It won't last.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No, thanks.
Do you?
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Make love to me.
Try me.
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
No.
Why?
Somebody always does.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Do you remember his name?
I hope I helped you out.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
No, sir.  They never even got a statement from her.
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it.  I always use a rubber.
Which one you talkin' about now, son?  We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
I'm going with you.
Is he dead?
You're looking for Catherine, not me.
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
No.
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
He was shot.
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Not sure. How was yours?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
Ten bucks apiece.
I don't like beer.
We can do better. It needed more white.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
No.
I can get ten.
You haven't heard? Andy's dead.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock.
Hmmm. And 'Parasites.'  You seem to be a Primal Expressionist.
You're not?
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Oh  you mean black people!
Good.
I think I could do that alone.
I do.  I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
I hadn't thought about it.
Pretty much the same.
They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.
Hi.
You like your dad's paintings?
Stand still.
I'd like to squeeze your titties.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Have a Mac.
You're a fast mover.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
So shut up and keep painting..
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
That's ignorant.
'Fraid I can't.  There's been a kidnapping ... Tell Selina ... Ms. Kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... No, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that I ... not in a dumb "Be my girlfriend way," but --
I think I'll take the stairs.
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
I just can't sleep at night. Exploding department stores keep me up.  One ...
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
You mean mistook <u>me</u>?
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Good time, too.  Everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after New Years'.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
I don't.  So, no.
I'm no cat.  I'm just an assistant. A <u>secretary</u> --
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
No apology necessary.  That's the first time in thirty years.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Not all heroes wear masks.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
Right here, sir.
What seems to be the problem?
Pheromones?
You are going back to school.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
Be ready for anything.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
Well...um...her.
Somehow he survived.  But the cryoslution mutated his body.
<		Maybe it's something in the water.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
Dick, don't push me right now.
Or what?  No one can capture Ivy but the big bad Bat.  Crap!  You just want her for yourself.  Don't you?  Answer me, damn it!
She's infected us with some kind of pheromone extract-
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
I'd love to stand here all day and exchange fashion tips but I'm kind of pressed for time.  So hand over the diamond, Garden Gal, or I turn you into mulch.
I always go a size smaller.  Makes me look slimmer.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Just what I had in mind.  Everything dead on Earth except us.  A chance for mother nature to start again.  Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man.  Sorry hon, this is for science.  Behold the dawn of a new age.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
What do you mean?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Hello, Jason.  I think I've had a change of heart.
Hardly a worry, sir.
...The night Batman was born.  What was I doing in the fields that night, Alfred? What sent me running out into that storm? I keep dreaming about it but I just can't remember.
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
We could give it a try. I'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
Actually, I like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
He sure did.
What?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
I'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
Touchy, touchy.
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
What I do isn't about revenge.
Yesssssss. I know!
What the hell is going on here?
Addictive isn't it? Just Say No. Until I say yes. A little fringe benefit of working with me. Now here's the concept, counselor. Crime. My I.Q., your AK-47. You help me gather production capital so I can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse Bruce Wayne's forever. And, in return I will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. Who is Batman?
About what?
Everything.
Batman! Don't you even recognize your old pal Jack? After all...  ... You made me what I am today.
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
Great.  Give me a grant.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
... We could try that.
I wish you'd...
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
I suggest a nice big bomb.
WHAT??
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
Oh, Jack.  -- Don't forget your lucky deck.
Jack?  Thank God.  I can't believe it's you.  I heard you'd been --
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Oh, it's too good.  We got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
Well, he must like the way he looks.  He's got a mirror in every room.
Yeah.  Peanuts.  Which is how he goes through women.
Why?  Aw, come on, Vicki, I'm a reporter. I'm curious.  I do this for a living.  There's a phone.  You can call him up and cancel.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a sensational idea."
Tom Jones?
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
She's ... well, she's good.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.
Ahm....
And a car.
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
It is urgent, sir.
Okay.....
You.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
Uh,...Oh yeah.
What's your problem Beavis?
Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing everything!
Uh... Uh...
Yeah, really.
Uh...
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh...
Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my life is like, flashing in front of my eyes!
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
Could you, like, tell her we're ready to score?
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
You'll have to speak up son. I have this ringing in my ears. My doctor says it could be related to my heart palpitations. I've had two operations on my heart.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Uh, Butt-Head.
Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll pay ya twenty if you go back there and do mah husband.
We're rich in what really matters.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
Two hours.
What?
But I'm not hungry, are you?
Death didn't improve your sense of humor.
Not really...  what's this?
But she <u>saw</u> us.  I could feel it.
Look, she's right.  We'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. I feel... confident.  C'mon.
I am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
<u>Night of the Living Dead</u>?  It's this gross movie.
We were trying to scare your mother.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
You Maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  So what's my cut?
No.  What's wrong?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
What do you expect?  You're dead.
Our cemetery?
About what?
I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
Step... mother.
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
And live in what, our station wagon?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
He's your cousin.
Otho'll know what to do.
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Let's see.  We could turn that into a media room.
Oh, they're still here.  They're Just not showing up.
Remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
It's okay.  How's the dirt business?
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
Just to take the proper precautions, Mr. Gardiner, I'd recommend we take you downstairs and X-ray your leg.  ... By the way, Mr. Gardiner, I would like to ask you something straight out.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Shame on you, Chauncey - you should let me be the judge of that.  Please, sit in the chair.
Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Yes, Robert - I am.  I'll go tell Eve about Ben now, Robert.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Stay here? Is that necessary?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
... But he's...?
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
I have no idea...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Very well... Can we rule out inefficiency...?
No sir, I don't believe I do.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Oh? Certainly...
My name is Chance.
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Yes, Eve. You'll be all right.
Hello, Eve.
I know you do - you and your television...  ... Good luck, Chauncey.
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
Then, I'll be brief. I covered the President's speech at the Financial Institute today, and since the Post would like to be as exact as possible, we would appreciate your comments on the meeting that took place between Mr. Rand, the President and yourself.
... Are you sure you like it?
I don't want Robert.
Ben is very ill.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
I'm glad he came, Ben. It was nice talking to the President.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
Oh. Thank you.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
It's very sore.
No - but Mr. Rand does have one with an electric motor, that way he can get around by himself.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
No. I don't object.
Yes. We need a very good gardener.
Louise?... The maid?...  But she should have left earlier today...
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
How were you paid?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
But you won't sign, correct?
No headaches?
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Oh, I've been just dying to meet you, Mr. Gardiner!
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
... Would you take me on a tour?
No problem, Chief.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
I'm sorry, too. Well, Nancy wanted me to send along her best to the two of you - and, Ben, I want to thank you for your time and thoughts.
Now, Ben, I won't have any of that. Why don't you listen to your good friend Chauncey this is a time to think of life!
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Yeah.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
I was worried.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
Right.
Now?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What?
Me and John.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
You fell in love with her first.
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I need a shower.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I love you so much.
I'm sorry for everything.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Dont let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
No.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Long term psychic or physiological repercussions?
Two hundred dollars, please.
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Says who?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
What's the play?
Great then.
Whatever you're having.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
You mean with Malkovich?
Then what? When you get through with blue and yellow, then what?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
Baby, don't be like that.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
She gone like they say?
I will.
What you want'em for?
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
That was fun.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
The church!
Why? Why he have to ask? Can't nobody offer? What's going on? Since when a black man come to town have to sleep in the cellar like a dog?!
NO! Shouldn't be no days! You know all about it and don't give him a hand? That don't sound like you, Ella. Me and you been pulling colored folk out the water more'n twenty years! Now you tell me you can't offer a man a bed?! A working man who can pay his own way?
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Till she showed herself.
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
You pick any house, any house where colored live. Pick any one and you welcome to stay there. I'm apologizing 'cause they didn't offer to tell you. But you welcome anywhere you want to be. My house. John and Ella. Miss Lady Jones..anybody. You choose. You ain't got to sleep in no cellar and I apologize for each and every night.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
Uh-huh.
Oh, man, don't say that..
Shit.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
Uh-huh.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
The?  Who the fff--
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
I'm going home, Donny.
Your phone's ringing, Dude.
Oh for Christ--will you shut the fuck up, Donny.
They were Nazis, Dude?
No, they--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
In the briefcase?
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser fella than m'self once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, wal, he eats you.
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know that you will.
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!
Huh?
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Excuse me?
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate souls cannot love in the true sense of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance Bunny is one of these.
Well--sure, I could do that--
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
From who?
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
But he's--
Yeah, but--
This is a league game.  This determines who enters the next round- robin, am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin said, look for the person who will benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying to say--
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
We throw the money out of the moving car!
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of rest.  Means I don't work, I don't drive a car, I don't fucking ride in a car, I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven, and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars parked in the trunk of our car out here?
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
What about the toe?
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.
Look, man, did you--
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
Hey, cool it Walter.
AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!
No Dude.
Then what's...
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping blood.  Might pass out.
JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE SAPS!
Dude, I'm sorry--
What the fuck does Vietnam have to do with anything!  What the fuck were you talking about?!
Right, Dude.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Fuckin' A.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Walter!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry. That's a foul.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
He's half yours, partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
I haven't forgotten.
Like cancer with a purpose.
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
I don't know about this, man --
Human?
Nomak?
From his father, of course.
It depends.  We came up with some unusual results on your blood test.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Going on twenty years now.
Who is LaMagra?
The vampire God. This speaks of His return.
But, he could've --
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
And that's a good thing?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
Blade --
You don't look so good.
No --
These are my people now. I'm one of them.
Sometimes --
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Perhaps.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
Habit, mostly, just like this.
Join the club.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
Try, please, Anna--
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Mrs. Leavitt--
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
I haven't killed any--
What?
That's not whatzername--it's Mary Brown.
--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
Oh, <u>c'mon</u>--even you have to admit this is weird.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
Why?
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
I want amphetamines.
I'm the ebay Boy, remember? I can't exactly afford that kind of equipment.
It's not about witches, goddamnit!
I do.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
What?
Yeah?
No fucking.
Su casa y shit-o hole-o.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
No idea--goddamitt!
--I don't know.
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
Goes right along with these two.
--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
--who?
The wheel.
--Graduate Thesis--
This isn't about us.
They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be <u>just</u> the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
--still go see the OB in the morning--
Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
I think it's time to get out of here.
I thought all your equipment got stolen.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
No. Elly Kedward's not the problem here, I don't think. She was just a good old-fashioned white witch--
I'm sorry.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
Anna--
I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
It won't?
Abby...
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
You can sleep on the bed if you want.
Yeah? What happened?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Ray?... What time is it?
Marty.
All right...
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
Right. Friday night is Yankee night. Where're you from?
Uh-huh.
It's not strictly legal.
It's, uh... it's in reference to that gentleman and my wife. The more I think about it the more irritated I get.
Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
...What?
Got something to show me first?
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
Right.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. let Tits see her kid.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
I was the same way when I was you age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey.
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
No way.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
No. please. I won't.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
There you go again. stop saying that. You can make it.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Yes. Frank-
I sure don't hate you.
Whatiya mean?
Frank would open you.
What if Frank came over here and found us?
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
Just get outta my bed.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I'm glad you do.
Don?. Where is he?
Hold me. I'M FALLING!
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
Let's take our neighbor out. Let him fuckin' walk back. 
Good, let's drink up.
That's too bad.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I don't know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. my father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Okay. yeah, call.
Yeah?
Who, me? Why should it?
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
You better not, Jeffrey.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
Jeffrey!!
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
Frank!!
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Where do you guys want to count?
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's for you.  I don't think there will be a problem.
We'll take it.
Lawyer says he can plead it down to five years.  I'll serve two.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Yes, I am.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's your grass.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Not really, no.
What kind of project?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
I would if I could get some sleep.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
But to the victor belong the spoils.
It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
I'm very angry with you, George.  Very angry.  You don't take me to California, but you take your bitch wife?  A woman? I understand you love her, but it was you and me who started this.  You and me.
What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's for peace of mind.  It's for the principle.
What?
Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat mouth.  You don't buy it all at once. It's called layaway.
You, you big old tightwad.  He still has his communion money.  Tell him, George. Tell your father about layaway.
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
People tell me that I am crazy.  That my business will never work in your country.  What do you think, George?
Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You are right.  But money.
I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo. You know the DEA knows about Norman's Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's fucked up!
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
Not mad.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Dad.
No.
Money.  You and your mother.  All the time chasing it.  I never understood it.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That's where you belong...
Figured what out?
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
I know.  Well, that's all I really wanted to say.  So, okay, then.
Yeah.
Well, here I am.  See?
How are you doing?
Yeah, sure, whatever.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I love you.  I love you so much.  You've got to know that.  You've got to know.
They're over at the booth.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
What if I brought you, let's say, fifty thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate some of your concerns?
And you believe the NLF?
Second district ... Explain better ...
The NLF has condemned you to death.
What ... What must I decide?
I don't even know your name yet ...
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Here?
Go away.
It's a question of habit ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Good evening, sir.
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
It could've happened to anyone.
Thanks, Mister D.
An inquiry into what?
For starters I'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?
Was the heart attack the result of natural causes?
What induced it?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Thank you, Doctor McCurdy.  Your witness.
Yes.
What did they argue about?
Your witness.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
Hey -- the bell's sounded.  It's between rounds.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
No.
Why did you come by?
I assume his girlfriend.
Rebecca Lawson.
Yes.
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
What kind of condition are you referring to?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control.  She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
What did she say?
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
What happened after that?
Did you change your will while you were with Miss Lawson?
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
What did she say?
We had dinner at a restaurant.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No further questions.
Yes.
I tell them to pour an amount the size of a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
We dated for about a month last year.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
While I was seeing Dr. Paley I mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the third floor dispensary.   Three days after I spoke to him in his office he went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing drugs.
What changed?
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
You still haven't answered my question.
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Yes.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
It's not my taste.
Tastes can change.
What would?
It's only the beginning.
No -- you're not.
You're a monster.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
I know.  What can I do?  He is the boss.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
Please -- not now.
It's more involved than that.
We have a witness who saw you go into the house at four thirty.
SO!
Why are there two deeds here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
No.
After the divorce.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
I don't mind waiting.
Oh! You caught me.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
Is the dizziness gone?
Francesca?
Yes.
You must get lonely at times.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
What made you ask such a question?
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I would love to come for dinner.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
How about if I set the table?
Sure.
No. I can't. Not yet.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Trouble. Why?
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Well, what is this?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
How do you know what I experience?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
TO HELL WITH YOU!
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Where you going?
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
Hell no!
Yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
What the hell you talking about?
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Pat's right.  It'll be fun.
Whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
Damned if I know.
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
What?
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
You know I can't.
If he was trying to kill you, you'd be dead.
Sure, if it was really him.  But it isn't that simple.  Jimmy's body died a long time ago.  And his soul is long gone, and all that's left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, I suppose.
Okay, okay.  Listen:
I can't find you.
I can't!
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
I been watching you.  You done good. Invested wisely.  Respectable businessman now.  Just like you always wanted.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
No time for eightball.  I got your tip.
Shit, that was fast.
But --
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
Gonna be le hot shit.  Pardon my Francais.  Dance club.  The Resurrection Brothers play there.  Heard of them?
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up and I can prove it.  Violet!
What?  It ain't no big fuckin' deal. I know who Don hires.  Did you know he did time himself?
Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Who are you going to call?
Just hurry.
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Sure, Gino, sure.
You know he would have done you, too.
Sure.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Why?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
You're doing everything yourself?
Yeah, come on in.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
No.
Maybe.
Why?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I wanted to apologize.
Tell me about it.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The |Business."
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm already in your bed.
So am I.
Nothing.
I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different.
I don't.
What was it then?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
I think so, too.
Yes.
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
You think I'm lying?
Then what?  Exactly.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I think everything is okay.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
I want a second opinion.
I'm not asking.
<u>No you're not</u>.  You're not going anywhere.  I'm shutting this down.
What do you mean?
Who are you?  Rome?  Paris?  Treadstone...both of us...I was warned but...
Am I Treadstone?  Me?  What the hell're you talking about?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
So now you know.
I don't know.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Look, maybe I should just...
You are a friend of his?
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. When they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
Do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
Really.
I hadn't heard.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
For twenty thousand dollars.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Yeah, well, welcome to the club.

Nothing.  It's just not there.
Anytime.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
I trusted you.
He had my picture!  He knew I was here!  He came here to kill us!
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
xxxxxx
I can't protect you anymore.
What about you?
This your store?
I'm sorry.
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
Hang on... 
How did I get here?
You we're lost at sea.  They pulled you out.  Who are you?  You were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  You understand me?  Who are you?
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
...sod you, stupid twit.
... new washer.
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
We know that too. You've come to the right place.
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
This is all a mistake! Don't you understand?!
Long time no see!
You sound worried.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Yes, I know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to Alison - and the - er - twins.
What?
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
Layton! Oh shit!
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Trust me. You do trust me, don't you?
And you're mine.
Say it was a mistake.
Yes we have, Jack!
Shut up!
Information Adjustments.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Ah.
It's you ... it's you ...
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Why?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?
Actual. terrorists? Well ... it's only my first day.
They'll be there waiting.
I thought you arrested me.
Oh God! What have we done?
We? Don't blame me!
Go away.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
Tuttle?
I've tried that! Population Census have got him down as dormanted, the Central Collective Storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the Information Retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... Security has him down as excised., Admin have him down as completed
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
How long will she he away?
There are some who go to Dr. Jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
Mother!
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Actually, I've decided ...
Thank you for calling Central Services. I am sorry, due -
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
Ha!!
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
Pregnant.
She say she in great pain.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
In that time, you ever have sex?
Mary ...
I can't hold up my head anymore.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Oh man, do you mean that?  Thank you man, thank you. How?
What?
His heart's beating.
Did you see my father?
I'll be right down.
How is she?
Mostly. It must be my face. My mother always said I looked like a priest.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
He'll be all right.
No problem. Thanks for letting me crash. It was the best sleep I've had in months. I used some of your soap.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
I quit! I'm through!
I hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  Better, huh? They're fixed and dilated. He's plant food.
The family know?
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
Better bring it all.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Why?
You learn that in the army?
No shit.
Sure, I'm taking the captain's exam next year. After the kids are in school, Louise can go back to the post office and, I thought, what the hell, I'll start my own medic service. Out on the Island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. It's just a matter of time and who you know. Someday it's going to be Chief Larry calling the shots.
You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
Why don't you lead?  I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You have the job you have...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
No?
No.  Don't worry about it.
Why?  What did they do to you?
London.  That's a promotion!
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Okay.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
Which would you prefer?
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [<i>sic</i>].
Good night.
Eleven and a half.
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not  tell you? -- it's a happy thing.  In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further.  Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
Did it really go well?
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No.  You know that I'm not.
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
I'm gonna go look at it again.
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I'll never tell.
I spent a fortune on this.
One's enough.
Okay.  And look, in the future I can call you when I have news for you. Don't feel you have to spend time with me just to get the information.  Well, that wasn't as hard to say as you thought, was it, Buddy?
Okay.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
Look, I can start up with him again if you really...
Well, who knows.  Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
I like "godsend."
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
How are you at back rubs?
I don't write.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Great.
This is hysterical.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
What?
We disagree on how God-awful it was.  Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
Okay...It's so good to see you.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
Not anymore!
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Yeah.
N-no...
When's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
Anything new?
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Let's see it.
Me too.
Oh yeah?
Sorry...
Bye!
Hm...
That means you like me!
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Listen, I'm going over to Walter's after the place closes.  I want to get a look at Murdered Man.  Do you want to come along?
Don't ask.
You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
I do the research.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Well...
I-I already got a new one!
You want me to open a window or something?
Just wait till you see this!
Huh?!!!
Telling you what?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Uh, I don't know.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Oh no, I couldn't do that.  Mrs. Swicker would start asking questions. She's my landlady.
I was just straightening up the place.
No... Not a boy...  Find out if they're dead.  And do something about that arm.  Honestly, I don't know how you made it through the Crusades.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Wrong answer!  No prize.
Amazing!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
The sun!  It burns!  It burns!
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
What's playing there?
Yeah?
What's Bobby gonna say?
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Come on, what was it?
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
So I noticed.
Jeffrey.  Projectile vomit.
Oh, come on, Buffy.  You know what's going on.  It's not working out at all.  I've got to move on.  I mean, I've got needs, too.  I told you about all this.
You guys are thrashed.
Not exactly.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Besides, Oxnard sucks.
For the dance.
What for?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
Listen, I know you're bummed about your friend, and I'm really sorry...
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I know.  I like your little outfit.
Not at all.  My name is Merrick.  I was sent to find you some time ago. I should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. You should have been taught, prepared.
Why?
You're one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. Forget you.  My, um, my boyfriend is gonna be here in about thirty seconds, and he's way testy.
I don't have time for your prattling. I have proof.  You bear the mark.
In the past.  A girl.  Maybe... A Magyar peasant.  An Indian princess. A slave.
China.
I have to show you.
She --
I have cheerleading squad.
It's true.
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
Sporting events, yeah.
Who we gonna beat?
Oh.  Good.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
They were vampires?
Try to pay attention.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Vampires of the world, beware.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Nobody is even gonna look at the game.
Later for it.
My parents have money...
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
Got that.
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
He is so bald.
Like we don't have rights too?
Run.
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Catch?
A little better.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
No.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
Yeah, Skip, it's me.  Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
Don't worry.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
What do you believe in?
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Let me.
I doubt that.
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
I thought I was--
But he ain't seen my heat--
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Learn your cliches.  Study them. Know them.  They're your friends.
Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Let go of me!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it.  Beats hell outta working at Sears.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
It's a league record.
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Eight and sixteen?!  How'd we ever win eight?  Jose, what's this sign?
Jim looking for somebody.
...he did what he was told.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
You were in the m- You were in the building.
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
But what happens when they do find out?
I mean, Frank Marino was there to meet him, but so were the cops. This time they wanted to pinch him for some diamond burglary in Antwerp.
Hold on a second.
He was a moocher, a card cheat, a country-club golf hustler. A scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.
702 472 1862.
Mommy.
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
Yeah.
Ginger.
Four aces, Doc.
Why, somebody's complaining?
Yeah, I believe it. You got banned.
Listen, Nick, you gotta understand my situation. I'm responsible for thousands of people. I got a hundred million a year goin' through the place.  It's all over, I'm gonna tell you, it's all over, if I don't get that license.  And believe me, if it goes bad for me, it's gonna go bad for a lot of people, you understand?
I don't wanna come along with you.
I lost control?
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
Ju-just stay away from her. It's none of your business, okay? There are certain things you don't do, and you know that.
That's right, yeah.
I see you, you motherfuckers.
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
And what'd she want?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
You have got me there. Old Don is as useless as tits on a boar.  But, he is my brother-in-law, and I would look on it as a personal favor if you'd think some more on hirin' him back.
I'll come by.
Half of everything is mine.
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
It's always been our policy -
We can't get rid of him?
He's juiced in. He's the County Commissioner's cousin.
...pit bosses, floor managers.
We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
No.
You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you?  Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you?
Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.'
I didn't take your pills.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
It's under...
With the money.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You'll come back tomorrow and get the rest. Just get out of here.
And where'd you go?
To the Riviera.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Fine.  Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
You listen carefully! You ever fuckin' touch her again, you ever do anything like that again, I'll fuckin' kill you.  Pure and simple. Do you hear me? Pure and fuckin' simple, I'll fuckin' kill you, you bitch.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You get down here!
Will you stop it? You're drunk, you're on drugs. You're gonna -
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Don't you threaten me!
Good evening, everyone, I'm Paige Novodor.  What should have been a routine licensing hearing turned into bedlam yesterday when the flamboyant Tangiers Casino executive, Sam
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Well...
I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.
This is not the way to treat people.
A record of the arrests...
No.
All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want?
Is this yours? Your pen?
Well, thank you. Why don't you take that fuckin' pen and shove it up you ass, you fuckin' jag-off?
Thank you.
Yeah?
No, you - You want me to come over there? I'll smack your face.
Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records.
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
I've been trying to reach you. You're tougher to get than the President.
You can't talk to me like...
Yeah?
Here we go!
I did - I didn't -
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
No, I won't calm down! He's my husband!
No problem.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Yeah, no shit.
Sure.
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality.  Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake.  I mean it.
Look, I'll try to find out what the hell's goin' on. When I see him I'll talk to him.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Come on, now, I don't want to see you unhappy.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
You just relax, and call me back here in exactly an hour, on this phone, and I'll see what I can do.
I'll be there.
Yeah.
Let me think about that.
Sure did.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Come on. Don't be scared.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
Nicky, please...
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
Well, you know...
Thank you. Very nice.
Get lost?
I'm always here for you.
No, Lester.
Do you know that?
Okay, then.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
He was just on the phone.
They check in alone?
All right.
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
What's takin' so long over there?
Yeah?
Hey, Shelly. 
Remo.
They're havin' a good time too.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot.
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
Fuck you!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Since when do you talk like that?
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
Crowd always buys it. What do we got?
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
In women?
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
It would be honor, Brock. Now let's go get this guy...
It may be time to get the police involved...
Pass!
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
I still have one left...
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Ask me another one--
Oh now this one is mine...
What?
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Oh Mommy, you're embarrassing me.
It's funny, I've heard of giving up finding a man and raising a family to pursue a career. And I've heard of foregoing a career to start a family-- but I think you're onto something new, Selina. "Absolutely nothing"-- Has a ring to it. I think it could catch on...How's that for sarcasm?
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
It's because I didn't come in. I live in the Hut, now. I meant to tell you..See ya.
You going to talk all day?
Where do you think you're going?
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
I'll see that he stays calm.  Pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
Wait!  I hear her breathing now. There, she just picked it up again.
Will you relax?  This in no way affects our business.  Go on.
Make a "U" and go back.
<u>You're</u> doing all the talk.
It's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
What am I supposed to do?
Any minute.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
They gave me pills to make me sleep.  They didn't realize how much Seconal I'm used to -- that I'd have so much tolerance --
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
My name is --
They tortured my husband.  Made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  Once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
I'm in traffic.  There's no place to turn.
Shit!
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
What do they need her for?
They know Jack will give them what they want once they have her.
What about the others?
Why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
Hey drop it, okay?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
They say my work is somewhat derivative.
I didn't mean to.  It's just the way I am.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
That makes two of us.
I've got to ask somebody.
When Jack sees they've got Rachel HE'LL tell them what they want to know.
The City National on San Vincente.
I heard someone pulling in behind the house.  I heard Rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  I don't know what they did to her.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
Not a chance.
Oh my God.  I heard her scream again.  What are they doing to her?  Why can't I do anything to stop them?
To hide it from the I.R.S.
Downstairs.  There must be an extension.  Oh my God --
Now you're going to do just what I tell you to.  No discussion.  No hesitation.
Why didn't you just shoot them?
The guy with the transplant.
There was <u>no</u> cop involved.  Oh shit!  Fuck!
L.A.P.D.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
Oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some Croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. She showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
Think you could do a picture of me?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Only one way to find out.
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
Pass.
Some loyalty.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
We don't see you.
You'll see her.
You should've done all this before.
Negative.
I won't let 'em.
Tailgate me.  I'll jam on the brakes.  You go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
You've got a <u>phone</u>?
I'm sorry.
She's not a girl, Col --
She wants to know, sir, do you like your hair.
Hi, Jimmy.
You fucking did.
Take your fucking goldfish, too!
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Who?
Don't know. Who is she?
Not me.
You know.
No, I didn't --
Where?
You want one?
Jesus.
I'm not on my own, am I?
Yes, please.
No, depends on nothing.
You mean that?
Absolutely.
Okay.
And you're not going to tell me more?
No.
Told you to stay in the hotel!
Stayed all day in that room thinking every noise was you. There's something you're not telling me, Jimmy.
I was trying to get out of something.
My pills...
Prescription. For my condition.
Only in times of extreme stress.
I suppose I tried.
You do?
Fergus.
What happened to Jimmy?
Thirty-five.
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Aha.
Did you give him it?
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
He's all right.
Someone's got to do it.
He's hot.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
You're never out, Fergus.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Was I?
You may be right.
Yes?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Thanks.
Yes.
Definitely unusual.
Aye, I do, Peter.
You being cynical, Hennessy?
Kind of suicide, isn't it?
My pleasure.
I can smell her perfume.
No fucking way.
Only joking.
What is it now?
Kill me.
You want to bet?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
Shut the fuck up, would you?
No?
And you play cricket?.
The fastest.
Means what it says. The scorpion does what is in his nature. Take off the hood, man.
Jody's always right.
Doesn't matter where.
Like what?
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
If they kill me --
A story.
Stop that talk now --
So if I ran now, there's no way I'd beat you, is there?
Tell me, Jody
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
What are you talking about?
What?
It's lovely.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
Well -- come on.
Adam --
The letter --
With whom? Where?
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Don't be an idiot!
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
You mean spies and things like that?
Only we call them agents.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
So that was it.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Thanks very much.
Yes, where?  -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
Who?
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
But no one actually saw him die.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Very good.
We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Bartholomew?
Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
No.
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
Okay -- up there.
Me?
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
Reggie?
Why you lied to me.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Scobie?
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
You did.
That sounds like their problem.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Alex --
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I don't think I know that one.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Fiction or non-fiction?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
What's its value today?
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
It is all right.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
No, Jean-Louis.
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
How's that?
I'm Regina Lampert.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Well, you're honest, anyway.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How did you find out?
Doing what?
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Starting tonight?
You mean you and me?
Having a nervous breakdown.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
What was what?
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
What?
I think I sprained my pride.  Where'd he go?
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
Yeah? What's that?
Why?
Don't flatter yourself. You'll be lucky to last ten seconds with me Ben.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
Calm down Brent.
Daddy you scared me!
Well yeah. Of course. Everyone kisses.
No honey.
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No.
Jesus. Any word from Brent?
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
Why?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
No!
FINE. Are you?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
Twenty eight years ago.
What?
Yeah. I think it's really sick.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Yes!
My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Deputy Webber's at the party. It's only three blocks away.
Mom?
Yeah. Who is she?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The word is Mob.
Two men left town right after it happened.
NO!
His mother's an only child.
I'm worried about someone.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Hide your laptop here.
Okay, okay.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

...two things Andy is not.  Uh, but I tell you what.
Why don't I--?
Hang on.  Hang on.
...and a shitload of ice.
I need your help.
And if that Elvis shit...
Peace.
...doing?!
No, no, no.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
Doesn't work.
...-ed.

Okay.
...reconsider that statement there, Night Shift.  You're psy-...
Back up!  Back...
Oh, shit.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  Everybody  dies!
Oh, shit.
That's right.  Now,  move!
 Okay.
Okay. 
Left, left, left!
...wanna give it a try!
I made it!
You okay?
 Gee, you think so?
...ho!


Gimme that, gimme that, gimme that.
Hey, put it back!  We're takin' off.


...-tion?
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  And what about me, huh?  What about Arlo, huh?  What about my needs? You know, I got a-I got student loans...

...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...


No. 

They're movin'.
Oh.

 I'm sorry.  I'm a little 

...-ful?!
Okay.  Okay.
...they come!
He's comin' up fast!
I'm gonna kill him.
What?
It's melting, man.
 
It's working.

What'd you come back for?!

Stop limpin' around like that.
Who put the big hurt on...
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
Thank you.

...here.   Mason... 

...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
Sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
Hold it!
Us.  Owe us. 
Exactly.
...including the permanently extreme.
Any of them Richard Long?
...-lar.
Now listen to me.
No!
No, go--
I know where the  blame belongs.  But I didn't put you in prison, Andrew.  The government did...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
I can't say it's a surprise.
I'll do it.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY.
EXT. DAM - DAY.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Prep the launcher now.
Move!
What about these two?
...in Missoula.  All we need to do is get to Mason before anyone else does.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
They'll get a break tomorrow.
I assume you want that to go.
...deer.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...Long.

And I can't guarantee the end will be quick.
...the river.
Where's Arlo?
It won't be long, gentlemen.



...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
I can handle it.
 ...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  I got it...
Ah.
INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
Go.

Uh-huh.
...try this one out some-...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...and that power...

Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
And what if it does?
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
Let me have those.
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Where are you now...
Forty-seven.
You find yourself wearing a...
 Talk to me.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
'Course you do, Jake.
Row twenty-three, section C.
That's right.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir, this is not a lending library, it's the Hall of Records.
I said horseshit.  Horseshit.
Thanks.
Who's the investigating officer?
Was he right?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Yes... I think I can manage...
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Not for your wife. That's the unwritten law.
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Yeah, yeah. If she'd come in here saying she was Shirley Temple you'd say okay to that, too.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
I'm not.
But what?
No.
And why's that?
Shut up.  Go on.
Where?
What for?
Yeah.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
What are you having?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Look at it this way. Now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. Whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. They were out to get your husband. Now if I see him, I can help him.  Did you talk this morning?
Look, I do matrimonial work, It's my metiay.  When a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
I mean I can't tell you.
No reason.
I don't believe you.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
So you married your father's business partner?
Oh, yeah?
Know him?
I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
And I want to know where.
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Then let's go talk to her.
Sure.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine.
She's my daughter.
I'll take care of it.
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Oh no.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Do you accept anyone of the Jewish persuasion?
Well, tell him I'll be back.
Only when I breathe.
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
I'm afraid so.
Of course not.
Never heard of 'em... new owners?
Yeah, I'll do that.
Since lunch.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
Yes.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
What about?
Jake, it's Chinatown. They're all over the place. You oughta know better.
No, you have a press agent do it.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
Yes. 
Elena. My name's Elena.
We'll talk about that later.
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Somebody stole it.
Well, it's hard to call an important person by his first name. But if it really matters to you, I'11 call you...  Toto!...
Get me a typewriter.  I'll finish the notice.
I'll write it myself.
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
Enthusiastic?
Not some girl he knew casually and then remembered after fifty years, on his death bed -
He made an awful lot of money.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Sure.  They're like anybody else. They got work to do.  They do it.  Only they happen to be the best men in the business.
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Charles.
It may not be about anything at all.
Toothache.
If you want to come in and wash your face -  I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
A rooster?
And I know too many people.  Obviously, we're both lonely.  Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
I see! 
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
But, it is impossible.  I will be the laughingstock of the musical world!  People will say -
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher.  I just try everything I can think of.
Marie has been packing since morning, Mr. Kane.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Why not?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
Look out that window.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
Sure I am.  She wants full custody of the child no matter what happens. If you won't agree to that, she'll apply for a divorce regardless of the President's wishes.  I can't tell her she's wrong, because she isn't wrong -
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
Rawlston is my boss.
Yes.
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
There's a part of a Scotch castle over there, but we haven't bothered to unwrap it.
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Nothing is ever better than finding out what makes people tick.  Go after the people that knew Kane well.  That manager of his - the little guy, Bernstein, those two wives, all the people who knew him, had worked for him, who loved him, who hated his guts -  I don't mean go through the City Directory, of course -
Yes and no.
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
Are you sure?
You think I'm shitting you...
You're the disturbance, pal! And here...  I'm buying some... what's this?... Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm no longer loitering. I'm a customer, a customer engaged in a discussion with other customers.
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
I take it she likes the guy.
Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore?
You can hold me down.
Can I join in?
So where is he?
I feel nauseous.
I can't believe you're here.
It's not what you think.
And you said yes?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
I'm giving him his ring back.
I just told you.
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before.
Sang.
You're such an asshole.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Um... okay.
It wasn't me.
This isn't fucking funny, Dante!
Call the police.
Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
This is the last time I ever come here.  And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open!
Are you open?
Annoying Customer.
So I'm no more responsible for my own decisions while I'm here at work than, say, the Death Squad soldiers in Bosnia?
So?
Bunch of savages in this town.
That's what I said.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
You win.
I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.
I'm talking to myself here.
What about Veronica?
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
So they build another Death Star, right?
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
I guess not.
What kind of show?
Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
There aren't.
Let's hear it.
Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin...
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
What?
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
See? There you go again.
Can we not talk about this?
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in.
You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes!
It's going to have to do for now, considering that it's my car that's up for request.  Can I help you?
Living proof.
You're happy?
No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me.
I'm not. She just left.
In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns.
I'm stuck in this pit, earning less than slave wages, working on my day off, dealing with every backward fuck on the planet, the goddamn steel shutters are locked all day, I smell like shoe polish, I've got an ex- girlfriend who's catatonic after fucking a dead guy, and my present girlfriend has sucked thirty-six dicks.
As if it's that easy.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Who're you kidding? You can so.
I thought I was doing you a favor.
Thanks.
How do you figure?
You need a ride?
Same time. What about you?
Hell yes, whatever that means. Now I'm gonna head over to Atlantic, drink some beers, get ripped, and- please God-get laid.  E-Z Wider, one-and-a-halfs.
Pay the good man.  Don't you close soon?
Wanna come to this party tonight? There's gonna be some pussy there, man!
I don't know. She was senile and shit. Used to piss herself all the time. C'mon Silent Bob.
Uh... sure. Go ahead. It's back through the cooler.
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold.
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?
Oh, you think so?
Something wrong?
It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
Three including you.
I'm not the pig you are.
Who?
No; who were the three, besides me?
All right. Name it.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Thirty-seven?!  My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven dicks!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
What did he say?
Good.  I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne.
A couple...?
A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go.
Can I have your name please?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My man is deaf.  I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY!  Neh.
You're not?
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
Bye  That was Snowball.
C'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
Who's shooting?
They're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, Gabe.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Hal will have my head for this.
Suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. Travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  Step into my office.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
I love you, too.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Sure you can.
Six...
Patience my love, patience.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Enough.
Don't believe it...  You know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. Everything you think just pours right out.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I don't expect you to understand.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
What if he can't?
Call me sentimental.
A simple yes or no would have done.
Cute.
Jess, c'mon...
Don't let me fall!
What the hell's going on?
No, he's gone.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
It looks like a winding route.
Climb, Gabe, climb!
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
What the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  Don't you see what he's doing!  He's hijacking the shipment!
The monitor! I never ask twice.
Kill him when he gets down.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
Matheson has been transferred from the Denver office to Frisco. As a professional courtesy between offices, I was asked if he could hitch a ride.
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?
You bastards... bastards.
I've been cured.
Won't you join me, sir?
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl. Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
How do you do, sir?
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your case. We want to help you.
What would you like to know, sir?
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a lot more school.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
What crime did you commit.
What job and how much?
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Fine, fine.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that... He stamps on Alex's foot.
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick it. Go on... Lick it. Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.
Right. Take the cuffs off him, Mister. The cuffs are removed.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
No, sir.
No, sir.
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes?
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. Alright?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Carry on, Chief.
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the Governor. Chief Guard closes door.
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!
Yeah... Pete the English.
Four in this block, sir.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
You got a deal.
No.  You were right, I was wrong...  ...Max.
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
It's no big deal.
...Bottega.  Guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, I think he's a ballplayer.  You?  Definitely Clarence Darrow.
Big case?
Max, the cab driver!
You're kidding me.
Was it great?  Better than great, it had to be...
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Twenty five?
So?
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
Vincent...
Of course!
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
It got crashed!  I didn't...
I see your point.
Yeah.  I share it with the dayshift guy.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
None taken.  There are talkers and doers.  I like doers.
No-no, I-I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.
I don't think I can do this.
You don't understand.  I mean it. Really.  I'm not up for this...
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
I never learned jazz.
I'm not catching a melody.
Leave me alone.
What difference does it make?
You'd do her a favor.
What, no insurance?
Doesn't cover everything.
Why?
That's jazz, my friend.  You said it yourself.  So don't tell me you don't know how to play between the notes.
Why?
You get benefits?
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
The F.B.I., the C.I.A.  You name the initials and they're down there.
Love?  Love's just a pretty way of saying, 'I want to sleep with you'.  Love is bullshit.
I gotta go, Flip.  Thanks.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
Shut the hell up.
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
This would be it?
Absolutely not.  A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
I've never read it.  I just -- Every time I see one I buy it.  I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Has this happened to you before?
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
That was him.
You watch me, don't you?
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Is that what they told you?
At a horse show.
No...!  But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA.  EX-CATCHER.  America works.  Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
Could you be a little more specific?
<u>Liza</u>!
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
That's your option.  Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time.  In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
And what did I say?
I don't understand.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Jonas builds assassins for a living.  Several of whom may be in place already.  We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Don't go home.  And don't go to work.  Either one could be bad.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
It's a hoax.  I knew it!
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
You're --
No doubt.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
What would you have me say, David?
A transport.  So are they coming or are we going?
Analyzing signal polarization shifts.
A third layer.
How can that be?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Ellie.  Pulsar?
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Mmm, that's a good one.  Maybe his echo...  Okay, no more stalling.
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
So.  What happens now?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
You sound like Joseph.  You think the world ends with the millennium?
Mmm.  Look closer.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
'The work,' Jesus, Ellie, can't there just once be more to life than the work?  Okay, maybe that's the only way to get the recognition, win the prizes --
And you think I don't want those things?  You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?  Let's get married.
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
That you, Valerian?
Like it.  Almost there.
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I don't think so.
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
-- I don't know --
Do you really think your life is meaningless, Eleanor?  Is that why you're so quick to risk it -- because if your life means nothing then you have nothing to lose?
It's designed purely as a defensive device.  Call it a reasonable precaution.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
But --
That's it, Mike.  Last time I checked, I was still running the country.  Although it seems that for the moment, Dr. Arroway is running the planet.
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
Have your department make a full report.
Git movin', I said.
It wasn't his fault. Nobody said anything about seats. We --
Like to oblige you, Arletta, but right off I don't know where to put my hands on 'em.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Sure he's got kings but you still gotta call him.
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
So then you just call him.
It'd go to your coconut head. You'd start getting ideas. Maybe even pass right out.
Well --- okay. It's a deal. One cold drink, if'n you please. In advance. One chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... That goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
Nuthin' can be a pretty cool hand.
That's it. That's the end.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Take it easy, Drag.
You ever eat fifty eggs?
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
He was lying.
'Lying.  He was lying.'  I asked you what you thought, not what he did.
I never hurt nobody...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
She's supposed to have it.
What book?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
In jail.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
Work with me.
<u>He</u> won't.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Because I'm his damned pin-up girl! His, all of them!  They know me. They're in prisons with libraries, they collect clippings, I'm their worthy opponent.  You keep my name out of this.
They get fan letters...
Ruben's dead.   So stupid, a cop thing, a crazy kid and a buncha dumb mistakes... I'm sorry... because you and he...
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Bundy.  That's the last one in your speech...
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
MaryJane.  You think that logic and police procedure, order and science and method will hold back the horrors of a world gone mad and the sickness of the night.  I did once. But you know how he'll get caught? He'll have an accident, or some cop will get lucky.  You can't catch him by being intelligent and working hard.  Or the worst:  there are dozens of women slaughtered in the most horrible way, month after month.  The news stories grow more grotesque and bizarre and in the city people lock their doors and windows, and hurry home before dark.  And then, one day, there are no more.  What happened?  Did he just stop?  Get tired and disgusted and decide not to kill any more? Did he kill himself?  Did he die in an auto accident?  Or a fight.  Or get sick and die?  It's like the murderer walked off the edge of the earth.  And you never know.  But you keep asking yourself -- when you read about a new murder -- is he back?
Will you stay?  Please?  I'm afraid to sleep... I don't want...<u>him</u>...in my head...
I know, baby.  I know.
No.  I didn't.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Maybe it's something you did in this life, Nikko...
God, you're cute when you're mad.
You're in terrible trouble, Nikko.
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Needle marks, fresh, here.  look at this...
Yeah, everything's different.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Shut up.
Would you step outside, Sergeant?
Give me Ruben back...
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
What's going down with the sting in Chinatown?  That gonna be off your plate in a week or what?
Have you seen it?
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
Maybe I am a little.  James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
So - why the airport?
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
You could get your wish at any moment.
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
Mom won't miss your wedding. She'll come around. I promise she will.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
Oh, no, of course not.
Wow.   Congratulations.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Everyone says it's the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
We all agree with the doctor, Dear. He thinks it's safer for you to stay here for a while.
I know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
What about patterns? Do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? Or washing your hands over and over again?
It's magic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
No.
No rounds for another three hours.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
What are the delusions like?
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
So there were no problems?
You like it?
You're so wrong.
Are you OK?
Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
I got worried. Are you OK?
You don't have to know all this by Saturday. It took me years.
Silly, silly, silly.
Well then why'd it happen?
I don't know. I don't fucking know.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Sure. Of course.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
I'm going to the store.
Are you all right?
Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I've met someone else.
He's a patient here.
I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Oh.
I start on Monday.
I heard about your friend.
I heard your friend was back in the hospital.
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
I'm glad you're doing well.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from you.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These tapes are gold. Do you have any idea what Zammito would pay to get them back?
It's me...
Good.   I have a job for you in America.
He sticks his toes in the water again, we'll cut 'em off.
Good word.
Uh, no --
Half the tapes.
And the other half?
How about if I call you?
You have something for me?
No one? Then why is Zero here?
You didn't buy batteries?
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
Even if we get out of town and go to another airport I'm sure the FBI and Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.
Get out of the room! You've got company coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Can I trust you, Sami?
I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.
Man, I can get anything.
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
I'll tell you when it's time.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Go look.
Oh yeah.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I've still got a few legal problems back in the States.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Hey, you know you can't this in France.
No.
He's over at St. James. They had to put two pins in his arm.
I know where she went.
Cool.
Watch this.
He's right. Do you have any idea what Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers" is worth?
Did she break your heart?
You ask a lot of questions.
Stick around and find out.
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
I'll get you the papers tomorrow.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Yes.
I do as I please.
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
On guard!
Don't bother.
Really?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
What do I care?  You were never a real friend anyway.  But I wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison.  It goes straight to the heart.
Spare your energy.  I'll be back!
Let's end this here.
Only the sword will settle this.
Jen!
Give me back my comb.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Let them look.
You were enlightened?
What was it?
I don't know it was stolen until I got here.
Well, we had talked...
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
She needs direction... and training.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
Not everything is an illusion.  My hand... wasn't that real?
I'll look around and catch up later.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Father!
What does it say?
Father!  Let me avenge my mother's death.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
Then someone's trying to set him up. We should inform Li Mu Bai.
This is a delicate matter.
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
You buying?
Double homicide.  A year ago. Las Halloween.
I saw it, too.
I'm sorry as hell, man.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
You're welcome.
He was a present.  Besides, we're moving anyway.  You said.
You gotta go now, I bet.
I went to see a friend of mine.
I took yours from you.  Your little girlfriend?  I took hers, too.  Your meaningless, petty life?  I took it so that tonight your existence might gain a purpose.  You're no avenger. You're mine.
Shelly?
Yes.
You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all.
Very well, it's your ass.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
Who got himself what?
You might say that.
I'll be fine.
You what?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
I know.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
What do you mean?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
The Fountainhead.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Thank you.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Who?
Doing what?
What?
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Oh please.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I can't win with you.
I have feelings for you.
That's not fair.
Sure.
But you knew this was important to me.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
- none taken -
The football stud?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
Cool.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
You promised to let me kiss you.
But -
Some other time, Cecile.
Need any company?
I know.
I know.
Baby?  Right on time.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Yes.
And you think she bought it?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'll be in touch.
Ronald?
I'll be right there.
Racist piece of shit.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Outstanding.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Care to make a wager on that?
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
So what went wrong?
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Where'd she go?
Oh come on. For her first time?
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Come again?
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Don't know what I'm talking about? I know that you fucked Cecile.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year  St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
The Farren house
I got my wish anyway.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
No.  It's not that.  It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Well, you know where it is.
That's the Farren house.
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
Why didn't you run after them?
And who did the voice belong to?
It was just a voice.
Voices from an old dark house!
Yes, Amy?
Because she is my friend.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
I'm your friend.
I've wanted a friend.
Whenever you want.
That's right!
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It stands so still.
I want to touch it.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
It's a pretty ring.
That's the clever way to do it.
Let me take another look at that ring.
Soon as I finish.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But what happened to the little deer?
Who is she?
Don't you hear it?
Look at me.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Go on -- out with you.
And Amy mailed them?
She pleaded so to do it
So do I, Mr. Reed.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Good heavens! What could you be giving me. Little Miss?
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Perhaps she's wanted for understanding.
Jennifer gave her a make-over.
I've changed a lot lately.
Yeah but they looked cool...
Come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
George bit you?
Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
Rule one: always wear make-up.
Frida, you're not making sense. I can't come over right now.
Yeah, I guess. Mark?
What? Why'd you do that?
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
What choice do we have?
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I wish I only had your problems.
Frida? You okay?
Sure. See ya.
So you're Grant's secretary?
I do development for TV movies.
I really gotta pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
No.
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
Did you change your hair?
Okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
No... no... this is embarrassing. I was returning your pillowcase... and I saw you cross the street... and I sort of started following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don't know why.
I'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
Mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
No, but thanks for the warning.
Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what happened to Mark. I want to help. I'm coming over.
You can't believe this bullshit.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
I told you she was innocent.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Yes, of course.  Everything's fine...
Loose ends?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's surprising.  He was leaving your office at the time...
I see.  One things for sure, hes ambitious. Youll be a busy man from now on.
I don't know who they are.
No...  No doctor...
A few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again...  Now, please leave me alone.
No.  I mean...  that isnt necessary.
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
I'm nothing then.
You can't go yet.  We've got so much to talk about...
No, it's the truth.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Share...
I'm... not... nobody...
I know.
TilT we figure something out.
Mild stroke?
Is that everybody?
Fine.
Clean.
Nobody's got clean kids.
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
I'm telling you, Bob,  it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
I don't think so.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
I'm not sure.
Well -- take care.
We're not upset with you, Dave.  We think you did a terrific job.  Don't we?
Dave...
Absolutely.  Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
She knows.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
The Fidelity nonsense...
What do you mean?
Oh... Kinda the same way.
You're not?
But it's ten-thirty at night.
The Vice-President...
Oh... Yeah.
Anybody would have done it.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
Thanks.
It's just so strange...
I'm starving.   There's got to be something open around here.
Yeah.  Is that funny?
I can't.
I know. I'm sorry...
There are no...headquarters. There are no...rebels. Only the walking dead. Don't you see. They have won.
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
Hmmmmmm? Oh, yes. Go on.
There's hundreds of 'em. Right where we landed our boat.
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
What?
Come on. Let's go.
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve as much...food...as possible. The purpose for feeding is to keep the beasts on our side. The fact that they can be taught to clean up our garbage or to fire a gun is a convenient side benefit, not the primary goal. The primary goal is to keep ourselves from becoming their supper. Keep them fed and they behave. Keep them hungry and they revert back to being the animals that they have always been. You saw them in there.
You are dying, too.
...but most of all because...they offend Thee, my God...Who art all good...and deserving...deserving of all my love...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
They're townies?!
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
And English, and trig
I told you, that's a secret.
I'm not?
This is better than sex any day.  This is romance!
No one, sir.  It was just me.  I did the proofing so I inserted my article in place of Rob Crane's.
Oh yeah.  Sure.  Valedictorian, National Merit Scholar
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
Hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  If they catch me, I'll tell them I made it up.  All your asses are safe.  Look, Gloria and Tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. Are we gonna have a meeting or what?
What good will that do?
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Sort of.
Knox.  Oh yes, Knox.  I'm glad you called.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
Are you going with Chet?
My Word
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
AHHHHHH!
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A sweaty-toothed madman
From the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  It will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Actually, I'd like to talk to you alone.
Not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
It's not too bad.  It's a tragedy! Why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
I can't just forget her, Pitts.  And I certainly can't think about math!
Listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
God, I want to do everything!  I'm going to explode.
Todd Anderson.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
I don't want to read.
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
I will be with thee straight.
That's where my boat's moored.
Just trying to get to my boat...
Jesus Christ lady...
Quite a few.
Right... You have a boat.
Yeah...
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
Someone's back there.
What is it man?
Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.
Nick's going?
Nick, Vince, Albert and John.
Who's full of shit?
Vince thinks... you know...
I do!!!
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
Here. Hit it here.
Married?
You talk to him?
Sal's alive???
Here.
Biederman, yes.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Oh. Nothing... Sitting.
Playing.
Right here.
So do I.
I don't think about the shot that much.
Fucking A. See that ribbon in the left. That's Quan Son. That fucking guy was at Quan Son!
What are you, God?
What do you mean?
We what?
I'll pick the moment, Nick. The game goes on until I move. When I start shooting, go for the nearest guard and get his gun.
YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY CRAZY!!!
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
No.
You know what I think? There's times I think you're a goddamn faggot!... I fixed you up a million times, Merle!  I fixed him up a million times! I don't know how many times I fixed him up... and nothin' ever happens... Zilch! Zero!... The trouble with you, Merle, no one knows what you're talking about! "This is this"? What does that mean, "this is this"? I mean is that some faggot bullshit, or is that some faggot bullshit!!! And if it isn't, what the hell is it???
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Six or eight.  And they go wild?
Up.
Up ribbon!
Mom, I hate to break this to you, but there's a whole other species out there you're neglecting.  If you've forgotten, they're called 'men'.  Sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
Jury found you guilty, not me.  I just called it as I saw it.  Fuck that.  You were brought here for a reason.  Doucet's escaped.  Re-animated for his parole hearing.  Killed a lot of people.  Most of them cops.
I want to see my wife and kid.
I remember what he looks like.  I can't forget.
<u>You</u> were the dirty cop... and I was on to you.  You panicked.  Afraid I was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
I was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  My partner's dead because of this guy.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
I've also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  They'll need your signature.
I got it.  I got it.
Well, that's good enough for me.
Commissioner Gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
Technothugs.
We don't know that for sure.  We'll have to wait until they move.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
That cost me two weeks' pay.
You're just afraid to use this.  You have technophobia, Wade.  That's what you got.
No, sir.
What else did he get?
...What are you talking about...?
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
Yeah.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
He lied to me again.
Guess there will, if it says so.
Well, I thought he'd come in the middle.
Why? It don't hurt.
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
I don't want to be up there all alone, Mama.... I want to be with you.
Howdy, Hank.
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
Belle --
You are afraid!
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
1840. Well, that'll take us to the seventh day of April in 1847.
Small? Oh, I see what you mean. Why, they vary.  Now a man like Daniel Webster, if I ever get hold of him, I'd have to build a special box for him and even at that, I imagine, the wing spread would be astonishing.  In your case --
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
I see. And this is where he'd like to collect, too.
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
Oh yes -- yes. Won't take a minute. Can you keep a secret?
Yes -- and that's the reason I wanted to talk with you. You got my invitation?
Why not -- ?
Shake!
Yep.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Not all of it?
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Mary -- how do you feel?
Mary -- look! Hessian gold. I found it in the barn.
Mary -- you just wait and see -- It's all -- just the beginning -- just the beginning -- of everything. I'll be the biggest man in New Hampshire and you'll be the wife of the biggest man.
You're not supposed to punish my son, Mary.
Isn't that your own fault?
I don't know, Jabez.
Mary! Come back ...
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Wouldn't profit him none.
Sure, Ma.
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
What mountain?
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
Gee, would you, Mr. Webster? Honest?
I've heard some odd things about Jabez lately -- he seems to make the wrong kind of name for himself.
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Talk has never proved that question, Mr. Webster!  Cup for cup -- what do you say?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Married.
But meant her moving here.
If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation.
John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing?
What are you going to do?
That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts --  -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me --
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Who said we were terrorists?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Put it down now.
Sure.  Follow me.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
Well, how'll I get home?
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
What are you talking about?
I know I am.  I know!
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
Sonny, would you please just tell them... please...
Yeah... yeah.
He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him ... they're gonna shoot the people.
If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to?
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
I'm afraid.
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
Okay, give us the women.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Well, what were you doin' back there?
What else?
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
Okay ...
Come on, lemme load you up...
Give me the keys...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
If you take anybody, please take me.
Sure - we like you.
We like you, too.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
No.  I had some legal training, but...
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out.
It was on the TV.
Pure?
You shouldn't start now.
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
Get 'em in the vault!
What?
... The bodies out the door.
Alive.

Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
We'd kill ourselves.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go ... but you gotta walk in backwards.
What can he do, he's clean...
I am.
He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person.
Sonny - Here's your document.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
I said you were never a faggot.
We can't stay here.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
Maybe!  Aw Christ, what dreams you live on!  Maybe what?
Doing what?
Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right?  You got me and Sal on TV ... we're entertainment you sell, right?
<i>Promise me... you won't tell her... that I never fucked Pat Benatar.</i>
Yes.
Yes. <b> INT. KEG HOUSE -- CHAPTER ROOM -- NEXT </b>
What!!?
Yep.
<i>The combination code is tattooed on his right arm. You'll never get inside Edna Fender's safe without the code-breaker on that arm.</i> <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Domino rides shotgun with her CELL PHONE to her ear.

Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Cunt.
Stop it.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Send her through to the conference room. <b> INT. FOX TELEVISION STUDIOS -- LOBBY -- NEXT

That's what I'm talkin' 'bout. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout.
My brother.
My brother.
Who told you to step on my sneakers? Who told you to walk on my side of the block?  Who told you to be in my neighborhood?
So?
So, in other words, you are not down.
No, are you?  We want some Black people up on the Wall of Fame.
It's about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
Ask Sal.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
Come back in a week, it will be squashed.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
No!
I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick Willie?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Slavery days are over.  My name ain't Kunta Kinte.  Sis, I don't want to argue, stop pressing me.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
I'm getting paid...
I'm not studying no Mayor.  Besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  My tenants and my ex- husband--Goddamn-bless his soul.
Talk to your son.
Big deal?  If that's not LOVE, I don't know what is.
No, just checking.
Sal, I want my money.
Do we now?
OK.  OK.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
When?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
I can't be staying long anyway.
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
You're still late.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
How do you know this?
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
Tell Vito.
Whaddup?
Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, I think.
... to the tune of "Only the Lonely" by Roy Orbison.
Excuse me.
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Just down the hall.
Very good. Back in a jiff.
What?
Your mom is the tooth fairy? That is so cool!
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Cool.
Oh, is this your special place?
Peg leg?
Yeah, go-cart accident.
Who knows? Maybe someday I'll be your new daddy.
The pilgrim who used penicillin to kill Godzilla.
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
Yeah, but we still haven't found any treasure.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
Oh. Sorry. You're right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
Some what?
Just wanted to see how your doing.
You're always your harshest critic.
Good - thanks Lloyd! I'll meet you downstairs, I gotta find some clothes.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
HARRY!
You're right. Hey, thanks for the jet pack. Your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. Bye Mom.
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
No. What happened?
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
I lugged it all over town!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
How could she miss this? This whole salute to Collins was her idea.
He's so modest. Probably embarrassed by all the attention.
I don't think that'll happen. We've learned a valuable lesson we won't ever forget.
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
You mean the lunch room?
I don't know what you're talking about.
TURK, leave him alone.  You're coming too.
Uh, thanks. God I'm so excited! So, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? He whips out the key, she takes it.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Can you believe it?
What are you talking about?
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
I don't think he'll smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I've been through this a hundred times.
Maybe someday. Aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
And you are great in bed.
Who's there?
The documents. The photos! The tapes! The evidence.
The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. -- The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE...
Oh yes? -- NAVIGATOR Better than those on Richesse.. You are transparent... I see many things... I see plans within plans.
Yes.
LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Don't you trust your own eyes.
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
That's it! The Missionaria Protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham.  I know the Dark things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.
Excellent!
 ...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
I can't... I can't.
No.
That it is.  He shall know your ways as if born to them.
You feel the flesh crisping?
They tried and died....  Jessica!
Those sounds could be imitated.
I'd know the difference.
It is my home.
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Don't you bave a car?
I refuse to drive in this country. Too many madmen.
I have no next picture.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Who do I play?
Of course!
Dracula?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
Don't worry.  I'll do something.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
I'm not getting near that goddamn thing.  One of those burned me on "The Return Of Chandu."
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
It was a very impressive offer. Fancy offices, a big home... I'd be treated like a king.
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Perfect.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
Rolling.
Don't you want a second take, for protection?
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Yeah!  I met a movie star!  Somebody <u>really big</u>!
Boris Karloff!?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Hey, <u>the movie's getting made</u>. That's the main thing.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  Now that it's done, so am I.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Mr. Wood, this is Mr. Reynolds, your landlord.  Could you please open up?
<u>I'm</u> interested in the picture business.  My associates and I wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the Apostles. But unfortunately, we don't have enough money.
Tor.  Have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
No.  With hair, yah.  But I must shave head for wrestlink.  It scare da crowds.  Dey like that.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
But Greta say --
Forget her!  Move on.  A good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
I did.  I established some tits and ass.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- <u>you're not</u>!
Who's Dr. Tom?
You don't know me, but my name is Ed Wood.  I'm a film producer.  I'm currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with Bela Lugosi and Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson.  And I saw you here, and I thought: Kismet!
Exactly.  Hey, how 'bout this -- what if I don't have any lines?  I'll do the part mute!
Here's to Ed.  For making us into something.
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
What if--you're vomiting?
At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
Is Mom here? I gotta talk to her.
Yeah, so... ?
It's your father. Hank. Your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
Hank was always good with the ladies. Always good-looking. Hell, he's been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
You're nuts.
You know what would be great?
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
That means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
Yes?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
We're falling behind.
Tell me.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No. Maybe he's watching.  Tell him you're sorry. Tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
Holy sh--
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Oh my god! On TV!
Well, when will she be back?
What are you talking about?
It means they hate his freaking guts. It means if he were on fire they wouldn't put him out.
Okay ...
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
No. Who?
Really? 
What?
It's nice.
Where were you?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Ray --
Oh, Jesus.
What's the dif --
Great.
It's me, Ed.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Hi, Shari.
No. Am I supposed to?
No. Two times.
Check forging.
Hi.
Good?
Ed?
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
Tu
El/ella -
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
He likes it.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
You're kidding, right?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Should be easy.  So far no competition.
Sure
Good luck, Tracy.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
My house.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
I hope so
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
I did it.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
points at the motel.
No, I... uh, didn't know that
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Right now?
Yeah.  I'm here.
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
But you've got a big choice right now. You can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. Or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  I personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and I don't mean the fleeting glory of sports.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
Okay, let's say
People can see this.
These are private -- these are for us.
I know.
But other people can see them too.
I mean at you.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
What do you mean?
Well, see, I was talking to Mr. McAllister about my leg and everything... and how I still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Sure, Tracy.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Tell me about Patchett.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
I'm not sure.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
In the morning.
Captain, what do you want?
You've got it, Wendell.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Which one are you and which one am I?
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
Patchett's dead.  He sent you after me.  I'd say Dudley's tying up his loose ends.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Wait.  Our deal still holds?
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
More.
I don't know.  I swear it!
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Oh?  you feel that way about people, too?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
And what?
Yes, Dudley.  I am.
I think you'll be surprised what Edmund's capable of.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
What about you?
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Rollo's the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it.  It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo.  But somewhere along the way I forgot all that... How about you, Jack? Why'd you become a cop?
What?
Decorated?
Bud White grilled me on it this morning.  You know, he's not as dumb as I thought.
Bud White's been here?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
No.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
You, me and White, huh?
I know how he feels.
Bisbee, Arizona.  The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I just called it.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
What'd he say to you?
Nothing. Two nights later I was robbed. I'm pretty sure they were pros.
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
Do it!
Clear as day.
I have a professional relationship with Rachel Banks. She's the go- between for a private investigator I use.
One of many people who would live a word with you.
It's a SAT-tracker.
Like a LowJack, but two generations ahead of what the police use. It pulses at 230 Giga-Hertz.
No shit.
What if--
We said a hundred.
I called my wife!
I was a traffic analyst.
They come after you?
They're here.
Them.
You sure?
Tell me about it.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Listen--
If they couldn't do that, they'd shut down the whole system, all the relays.
How?
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
It's Pat Cary. I work for Senator Sam Albert and I was given Jerry's name.
Ah, sir, you know, it's not for me to say.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Anytime.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
I'll say.
What size?
Hey, did you guys find my stuff?
About the accident.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
So you tap everyone's phone? You use computers to probe financial records? New Search and Seizure laws?
Right.
No.
It's not true.
I have lunch with Rachel once a month. She's my connection to an investigator.
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Maybe it's not connected yet.
Sir?
I've got photographs of you at the Trenton Ramada looking very--
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
Eat your fish.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
You have to.
What makes you think it's you?
It's not me?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
--otherwise we may have to--
This is <u>bullshit</u>. Someone's mixing up a bunch of half-truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.
Fuck off.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Sure, go ahead.
Really?
Dad!
Do I know you?
Who won the fight?
No.
The blender?
They didn't take the silverware?
What?
I don't know!
You gotta--
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
Yeah?
I need help.
The police?
Yes sir.
What?
Sir--
I just meant--
Lyle?!
So they know everything.
We don't know.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
You have any idea what kind of position this--
What kind of fossils?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Which stall?
That insults them.
Excuse me.
As the wife of one of our party.
Look over there.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Don't.
What?  No!
It's a folk song.
Don't do this.
It hurts too much.
What?
I promise I'll come back.  I promise I'll never leave you.  And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
There you have me.
You too.  Good luck!
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Are you mad?  Katharine loves it here. She told me yesterday.
Very well.
I desperately need a jeep.  There's been an accident.
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
What did you do?
I was talking about the girl.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Which we've overflown twice.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
May God make safety your companion.
There is no God.  But I hope someone looks after you.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
Okay.
You were in Africa?
I can get in the back.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Moose.
Is there a song you don't know?
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
No, now I can't kill you.
Oh.
Candaulesyou're laughing at me.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Your friend?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I don't think it's indifference.
You'd better be.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
Yes.  Later.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
I had a hotel room.
How awful.  What will you do?
Then you were married?
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
Which you have in mind.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Who am I?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
I'll call an ambulance.
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
That's good. Terrific.
So what?
Got it.
We're only going one way.
Good morning.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
No one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
A dozen times.
Charged. Receiver?
It's---beautiful.
Thank you.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Duh.
Get the hell in.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
The eight billion. From them to us.
And the money goes--
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
In the van.
And you do it so well.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
This is big enough.
Because I never assume anything.
You better not be taking on a new partner.
Check out my ball.
To yourself, that's where.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
Yeah. Probably not.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
He's a low-life.  Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
Erin --
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
I would now.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Is that what you want?
So what are you thinking?
Maybe.  but maybe not.  We still don't have anything linking this to PG&E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem.  Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
It's PG&E saying to the judge that we don't have a case.  Their lawyers go --
Gee, I wonder why.
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Five years, maybe, for a trial.  Double that for the appeal.
I did.  Both.
How do you know that?
You see your office?
The extortion, the threats ...
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
You come to the right place.
Nope.  Maiden.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Have you been to the water board?
I'm gonna hate it.
It happens all the time.
Well I hate it.
We'll see.
When?
Yeah, we had them couriered over.  And listen, good work.  They're a great start. We're just going to have to spend a little time filling in the holes in your research.
Thanks for reminding me.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
I'm just saying --
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
No, I wanna say hi.
About what?
Mm-hm.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Have you been logging on?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
Well, this old neighbor of mine, Bob Linwood -- he ran the dairy on Community -- seemed like someone in his family always had a rash somewhere or other.  I just figured it was something in the genes.  And you know how it is -- you don't like to ask about things like that ...
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
The Emperor?
Move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
Strong is Vader.  Clouded is your fate.  Mind what you have learned ... Notice everything, everything!  It can save you.
No ... there is another.
You must go to the Dagobah System ... There you will learn from one who taught me:  Yoda, the Jedi Master.
You don't know that.  Even I cannot see their fate.
And that is why I must go.
Growls a reserved greeting.
That was a long time ago.  I'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
Why don't we just turn him over to Lando to fix?
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
I respect you.  You're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... HAN No, your worship.. That's not what I'm talking about.
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
I take it back.
We've got to get out of this shower.
That should do nicely.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Where have I heard that before?
Where?
No lightspeed?
Oh, so sorry!  Didn't mean to offend your droid.  You think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
A mining colony.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
Thanks to you.
Vader agreed to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.  They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
He doesn't want you at all.  He's after someone named Skywalker.
Not really.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
And when do you betray us again?
You've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
I thought you knew this person.
Let's go.
That's just great.  Why doesn't everyone just take off?
First Han, now you.  When am I going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
I've never seen it fail.
I thought I was in good shape.
Anger, fear, aggression!  The dark side of The Force are they.  Easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  Beware, beware, beware of them.  A heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
Control, control you must learn of what you see.  Not easy, not fast.
Difficult to see.  Always in motion is the future ... Back away, little machine!
And I too.
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
My name is Cornelius.  And this is Zira -- my wife.
But we saw Earth destroyed.
Yes, but don't take any chances.
With particular emphasis on the cranial and oral areas.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
Having second thoughts?
You don't understand. It's already in you.
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Good.
Locked.
Hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. Launch.
The name's Plissken.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
I said pull over.
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Oh no, it's the Doctor.
You need help.
The what?
How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
Give me the prototype.
Yeah.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
Move aside!
But your life and lands are far from here.
And a great heart it is. Sir Lancelot, you will be my champion.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Yes. He spoke to me. He said I would fight bravely tomorrow. I have never dreamed of Merlin before.
That's not why you came.
There are maidens as fair, and fairer than Guenevere. If I put my mind to it, I could see them now, many of them, weeping for love of you, watching the hills for you coming from the high towers of their castles. Offering you their every favor. Rich, clever--but if it is to be Guenevere, so be it.
Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Your mother told you that?
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
He has given up.
We are to blame.
You're a man?!  ...with metal skin!
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
One land, one king! That is my peace!
Well what's wrong?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Ten maybe twelve years ago, in Africa. The exorcism supposedly lasted for months. I heard it damn near killed him.
Yes.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
You're telling me that, I should take my daughter to a witch doctor? Is that it?
Yeah, well I guess you should've.
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Groceries maybe? A package?
Want to ask him?
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Depression?
And those lies she's been telling?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
I'm Father Karras.
It's the other way around. The society sent me through med school.
About my daughter?
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
Did you know my mother died recently?
It's not important good night.
In Europe.
No.
You like it?
Oh yeah, well let's both play.
Captain who?
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
Okay.
Honey it's to help you.
Hi Father.
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
I stole it.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
I get passes. In fact I got a pass for The Crest tomorrow night. Would you like to go?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
Show me Regan and I'll loosen one of the straps.
You and Regan?
Bon Jour.
No.
I think it would be helpful if I gave you some background on the different personalities Regan has manifested. So far, there seems to be three. She's convinced-
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
Save your servant
And also with you.
Amen
I once did a paper on it
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Incidentally I mention only in passing that I could tell the judge that it was a matter of confession.
Who's in it? Debbie Reynolds, Desdemona, and Othello, Groucho Marx. You're happy?
Come on!
Be silent!
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
...Be gone!!
Is there someone inside you?
Yeah, come on in.
Twelve years.
We have some lotion.
You bring trunks, Jack?
Uh-oh.  That's not good.  Let's get him up here.
No bones.
My brother and I. One each.
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
Recognize these two characters?
Wait.  Watch.  Here comes Dad.
When they coming in?
Two nights.
Frank.  I'm here.  I always get here.  Don't sweat it.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Like an angel.
Fuck him.
Fuck him.  Great.  Terrific.  Fuck him.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Try the black Knable.
You look awful.
You gotta go.
What're you talking about?
Terrific.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
That's what we agreed.
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Let's get it over with.
Ma? Ma?  Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador?  Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
How about these?
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
You recognized me.
First night?
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
Unless you want the right.
Good idea.
Doesn't it matter to you?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
She's a big girl.
Dedications.  I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room.  The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it.  Daniels went crazy for the idea.  And that's not all.  Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability.  Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
How come I didn't hear anything?
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper.  Unlike me.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
February?
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I told you.  It's a useless talent.
You could've come.
The tenth's out.
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Just until we find another girl.
What disease?
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
Thrilling.  Both of you.
So she's got a few sniffles.
It's one of Jack's favorites.
Really?  Isn't that a coincidence.
Yes, it is.
Well ... thanks.  Bye.
My watch is broken, too.
You're an hour and a half late.
Miss --
What's that mean?  Thirty-eight.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
Where's your dress?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
Nine!
Don't worry.  We'll take it out of your share.
Piece of cake.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Hey.
Well then ... shall we?
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Born and bred.
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
I mean, I'd hate to think I'd pick up someone who wore that shit.
Save it.  What's he look like?
And you don't?
He leads, I follow.
Pretty much.
Not for money. With my mother.
Huh?
Nothing personal --
Like a baby. You?
In and out.
Better than that.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
What's that supposed to mean?
Friend.
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Huh?
You sending me home?
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Oh.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
So ... ?
Huh?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
He's got blood in his eye.
Married.
My days are not the old days, genius.
The recent past.
Looks old.
Not so good.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
You mean if I get sick?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
Sorry, Admiral.  It wasn't mentioned in the job description.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
It's important.
How come?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Our Pacific Rim stations. These numbers must be bounties. Castor's not wasting any time.
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Eve ...
That's what they always say.
Would it?
Damn right.
You missed the last three, including her birthday.  Your wife's gripe sheet.
Not anymore.
What's that?
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law.  Remember what my brother called you?
Gone?
I'm not going anywhere.
Yes, Jon.  That Karl.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
Adelle?
I can see that, Alan.
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Whats going on here?
Sure.
Dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Ah. A classic...
Trouble at work?
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  Youre doing well...
Ive got all the time in the world...
I've got everything I need.
You?  What about me?  Im working hard for you here, Jack.  On Christmas too!  Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  I was moved...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this!
Get out!
Thanks.  To you too...
Maybe youre not hearing me.  I am Jack Campbell...  Right here.  Jack Campbell, President...
You mean dont go at all? What about my internship?
But its twenty degrees outside...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Really.
I cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I couldve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
Good, Jack.  Maybe well keep her.
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
You cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Thats why I work for Big Ed?
Its good, right?
Now...I dont...
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
A perk for what?
Are you okay, Jack?
Its good to see you...
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
Kate? No, theres no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Of course I did.
Maybe its by the wardrobe boxes...
Congratulations. The La Guardia flights canceled but I got you out of Kennedy on United at nine. Am I good or what?
I wouldn't know anything about that.
You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Five times.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
This isn't permanent, Johnny.  We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
What is this?  Where's Reed?
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
What are you trying to say?  Just because I dress well and like to dance --
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
You were at 4000 Kelvin.  Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
And if he's not...?
Showtime.
History, Leonard.  <u>History</u>. Everything else is conversation...  How's the other matter?
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
The number's <u>seventy-five</u>.  And it's applications <u>and</u> patents.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Ben's still out there --
What I <u>should</u> have done a long time ago.  Applications and patents, Reed. This all belongs to me.
Which was?
If it happened to him, then it could...
Excuse me?
I think it was a little more complicated than --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
Skeptical...?
Medical's ready.
That can't be -- there's no direct connection between the two --
They'll make up some time, once they get through that and reach the Pleural Cavity.  Respiration Post...
I'd hold that off awhile.
I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
Difficult? He's impossible!
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
But big enough for us...
But I did. I'm positive!
I have no idea.
Not anything built into the chassis.  If it hadn't come loose --
What gives you that idea?
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
That's not the purpose of this mission.  Captain -- keep a straight course -- until you're in the clear.
Captain -- head in the d1rection of the flow and drift with it.
Nothing -- against all that force.
All I'm asking is you test it beforehand!
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Oxygenation...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
We could follow the Optic Nerve to the corner of the Eye.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
You have no right to blame Duval --
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Looks simple to operate.
Not to the valve. But we've lost too much air to make it the rest of the way.
It's less than one ten-thousandth of an inch thick. And porous.
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
"No." First thing you've said in the last four hours. That's a, that's a fountain of conversation, man. That's a geyser. I mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. Shit, I'm sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from Brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can't say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
Huh?  Grimsurd looks at his thumb.
Huh?
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Okay, Jerry. You're tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you won't - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that Ciera.
What the heck d'ya mean?
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Ya got that right.
Yah.
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Oh, man!
It's okay, Scotty. They're not gonna want to hurt her any.  These men, they just want money, see.
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
...Brainerd?
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
Yah, so we're all set.
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
All right, Jerry, you got this phone to yourself?
Yah!
Mr. Lundegaard, that very well may be. I must inform you, however, that absent the receipt of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon, I will have to refer this matter to our legal department.
Yah.
I'm sure sorry. I - Shep told me 8:30. It was a mix-up, I guess.
Yah, well, it's a chunk, but -
We might be innarested.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah.
What kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
Yah, but I - okay, I would, I'd guarantee ya your money back.
Now come on here, no way, Wade!  No way!
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Yah?
Oh...
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Gotta go?
No, that's okay.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah, ya know it's the Radisson, so it's pretty good.
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
No.
Linda Cooksey?
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
The day of our homicides.
Yah.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Don't go in! Wait for back-up!
Yah, ya think?
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Your mallard?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
Well... Why don't we...
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Bob.  I'm okay.  How are you?
Really, what's that?
The first rule is... you aren't supposed to talk about it...
Yeah, both of us.
Hmm?
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I am Jack's Cold Sweat.
What does that mean?
Red-and-blue Tuinal, lipstick-red Seconals.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
You can't have both parasites.  You can take blood parasites --
You can't have the whole brain!
Marla?
You haven't been going to yours.
I found a new one.
Like testicular cancer?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
Why would you ask if it's a guy or a girl?!
Let go of me...  Leave me alone.
What?
Is this a trick?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
What?
Who's this?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Yes... it's a test.
Look what we've accomplised.  Thirty seconds.
Pardon me?
Tyler Durden.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
Well, I have to file a claim...
A hotel?
Yeah.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
What?
It's called a "changeover."  The movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
The fight.
Hemingway.  You?
Good.  This chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. The things that she said... I've never heard a woman talk like that...
I'm fine.
Work.  Going to work.
Nothing.  Do what you like.
Hey.
No.
Look...
Why did you do that?
Why do people think anything?
I don't know!  Tell me!
What are you talking about... ?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
She's... you... you're fucking her.
The buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  Everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
I'm serious.  That's the wrong one.
Appreciate something.
Very good, Sir.
You told me you'd say that.
Well, sir, you said you might.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
How can you say that?  What kind of monster are you?
And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way?
I was dead.  And came back to life. An EEG machine.  Where's Eugene?
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Take my van!
I did.  And right now, I don't think she cares.
How do you know?
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
What feeling?
I think. But why'd they make him up like... Michael Jackson?
Thirty-nine.
Right. April 25th.
Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
All I owe is these people.  To live my life to the fullest.
Why do you think I was hiding?
Design?
Insertion.  Call in to base camp by TRANSAT.  Proceed to point Tango November for rendezvous with our ground contact.  Indigenous agent. Co Phuong Bao.  We've been over this three times.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point Echo Delta. Doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that's the last time, Rambo!  I swear to Christ.
That's what I'm here for.
We're leaving tonight, not in a week.
Read you.
No.
Damn!  Leeches.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Yeah...
Nothing we can do, man.
It's a Soviet MIL MI-24.  Probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
Why's that?
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Let's go.
I do?
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Let's get that tent down!
What's the plan?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
He... took it.
Have fun.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
What that?
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
Keep it clean, Rambo, or I'll nail your hide to the shed.
Yeah.
No, thank you.
Do I look like I have someone special?
Yeah!
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
I was attacked.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
He's not a moron.
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
But..How could that happen?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
She <u>likes</u> me.  She said for me to call!
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
I'm... just looking for Parry...
He's not here.
No, I have to work.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Lydia.  Lydia what?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry!
You really want to help me?
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
Who?
What are the other reasons?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
I don't like horror movies!
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Divorced.
Shhh...
No, dammit, I would easy.
I know you're not.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
No, let's go...
You got any change?
I didn't get it, did I?
Five'll do it.
Okay, I'll make it as easy for you as I can. Give me an omelette, plain, and a chicken salad sandwich on wheat toast -- no butter, no mayonnaise, no lettuce -- and a cup of coffee.
Well, you seem very professional...
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Tita, I've got to go...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
Sometimes.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
What about Carl and Catherine? Is he just coaching her, or what?
Yeah, well, he's...
Where's Catherine?!
I don't know where she is!
Bye, Robert.
Well, I wouldn't want to get too invigorated myself.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Then after that?
Yeah, I'll probably be free.
Then I must have been supplying it.
Shut up...
I don't believe vou.
Yes.
Yeah, I think I could.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
I have to talk to you.
Oh. You have to tell me that.
Catherine...
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you...  I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
Yes.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
I hope I didn't hear that.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
You better hold onto your tongue!
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Just get the fuck outta here.
Alright.
I, umm, came to see you.
A play-ya.
Me? No. Don't want none either. Such bastards, man.
I think she lives down by Pitt.
I think he's 18 or 17.
Um, yeah I think so.
Okay, then dance. Show.
Who?
My friend told me she lived around here.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Hey!
You live around here?
Yeah.
We'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
You mean her.
I wasn't asking.
Creasy, how old are you?
They didn't do anything.
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in Rio.
We play tennis at the club.
Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
Your aunt?
I can't discuss another patient. You know that.  Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Fletch...
You don't know me.
What, the heat here?
Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive.
Can I get you something?
I guess not.
He'll be so relieved.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
It stinks. I thought woman were independent now.
She was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV guy. You can't get lower than that...
Dropped two big ones. Real fighter. You're in the insurance line, Harry?
Well, I'm fully covered.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
Gee, I must have been shit-faced at your wedding, I don't --
No problem.
What?
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
Shoot.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
I'm sorry?
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
Oh, mine! Thank God.  Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's?
Say, the reason I asked about Alan is that I bumped into him this morning and you know what I can't figure out?
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
I mean put clothes on.
You were in the war?
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
Long story.
Have you ever heard the name Jim Swarthout?
But I've seen the deed.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
I'll take you to a game.
What are you talking about?
Don't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
Very good sir.
I commend him on his choice.
She moved out.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
I will, Frank, I will. Something came up, okay?
I never read the paper.
...never reads the paper...
Why not? Oh shit... really?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
How gray?
You're onto something. That's good. What?
Utah?
Get out of here.
You were going to can me, right?
Who's Frieda?
My secretary.
Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here... I'm a new member.
But I ain't got you...
Uh, let's go sit down.
I'm sorry, that's gotta be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
Listen, Queen Collie, I have a code. I never, ever, drop a case.  Besides, I, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so I kinda owe you.
Question one:  Can I have some money?  Kidding.  Why didn't you tell me about you and Johnny?  You two were into something even more dangerous than sex, weren't you? Who?  What?  Where?  How?  Now.
Tell me about it. Name's Kyle Troy.  Can't we bring up the bass.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
You don't want to know, believe me. But don't worry, I washed my hands...
Yeah, let's bury her.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Ye-ah.  Sure.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Smooth.  I know this is dangerous and everything but it's kind of fun. Ever see "Batman," you know when Batman and Robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... I forget what they said but it's pretty funny.
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Run to the nearest phone and call the police.
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
'Booty Time.'
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
The case!
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Doyle.
Cause if I do.
B.O.C.A.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Man, I'm clean.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
That's a relief.
Marseilles.
Whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  The kid comes in at six will wake ya.  A couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
Walter, I can make this case if the Feds will get the hell out of my way.
How about that time you were picking your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Not a chance.
Give who a tail?
A and A, that's all you're interested in -- Arrests and Ass.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
This is my case.  Get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
Whatta you got?
What is that old building?
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Well, I think you do.
They around?
Where's the collar, in the cells?
We gotta go underground.  Get those guys out, now.
The game, Graham.  The Series?
I seem nervous, huh?
Well, why not a little of the King?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I'm serious.
About what?
Uh, huh.
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
Frank, this is insane...
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Queens, New York.
What?
This afternoon?
What'd you just say?
Oh, that was my kid.
Gordo, if this is you, so help me...
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Yeah...I think so.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
But you're not...you're not still here.
I lost you.
You're the voice of an angel, Johnny.  If you hadn't told me, no way I would'a ever made it.
Whatta you mean she's not here?
What kinda twisted animal.
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
What are we like in...1998?
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I don't remember.  Why don't I remember?
I know pal.  I remember.  Twenty-nine years tomorrow.
Fire?  What are you talking about?  He had cancer, John.
Nothing you're willing to do.
Mind if I shake it off first...so's I can concentrate better.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
You work too hard, John.
I'm sorry.  I didn't realize...  But she knew, John.  A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Sure.
Hello.  How are you?
Okay.  There's a whole weekend ahead of us.  There's time.
Did you stay here last night?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
In that little thing?
Why don't you help us?
Uh... I guess I'm just not hungry.
Not us!  He's really creepy.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
Damn you, Shelly!
My friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
Why?
Why?  Because I've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Just drive.  He'll get out of our way.
Sheriff, you better take this.
Yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
It's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
No more.
Who ya calling?
Huh?  Oh, come on, Sis.  I'm tellin' ya, we can't play Clue with just two people.
I think somebody's messin' around out there.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Yes, but they released me because...
They were gonna!  But some asshole sent a lot of money to give Jason and his mother a decent burial. Now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  In the morning I'll call that clinic and see if they...
You're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Yes.
No.  Not here.  Come by my house tonight at eleven.  Don't be late.
You food'll be right out.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Yeah, she's good, considering. That kid just takes everything in stride.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
For a good reason.
Tell me.
You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  Hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
Oh my God, Steven.
Have a good night.
Yeah...
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
She's a waitress at Joey B's but she needs some extra cash.  Ward's the pimp.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
A pizza?!
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Time to check out the waiters.
I mean, Lakeview High just closed its doors for good, right?
It's...dead.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
We have to get off this ship!!
Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
And she sure doesn't have one now, either. She needs to live.
But that doesn't prove that he's the one!
He is not.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm staying.
But Sean said...
This isn't a request.
Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
Hi, Sean.
I heard you weren't coming.
What do you mean???
Drugs...  Then Jason came. He's here, Sean.
What did you find?
You are going where?
Ruptured steam pipe.
Elliot?
That sounds so final. But are we really surprised?
We must abandon.
You will suffer because he is in the theater. And you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.
We're talking about something deeper than grudges. How do we respond to personal attack?
What do you mean?
Let's work on it.
This could be it.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
Why do you need a radio?
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
There's nothing left for me to lie about.
First you tell me.
Mystery. Deception.
Two-all after six.
That's always been my problem.
And you've been extremely patient.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
One more out.
A thousand things.
Pop, will you let me in?
It's me. Nicky.
Lillian says it once a week. `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
But the son is suppose to stop crying.
Don't make me sit through one of your plays.
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
He used to love losers. But the laws of physics changed.
Washed away.
Because life is good.
What about my play?
Postpone. We have every right.
You're dangling from the last letter of your last name.
When the Mets lose, they just lose. It's a flat feeling. But the Red Sox -- here we have a rich history of interesting ways to lose a crucial game. Defeats that keep you awake, that pound in your head like the hammer of fate.
Because he is so deeply hated by so many people in the business.
Yes.
I kissed Shirley Felder on the teeth.
Yes.
There was a review.
And he has finer moments now and then.
Endearing.
A little drastic maybe?
Would you like to meet him?
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
Where are you going now?
Never mind.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
Mr. Khan said they called you brave.
Everyone takes his turn.
Eleven.
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
Well, he must've found some of the answers...
I've never spoken for anything else.
It was one incident.
It would have been uncivil of me to have let you make such a long trip for nothing.
I would rather march.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
That's when you take advantage.
I -- I will write to the press -- here -- and in England.  And I will use the courts.
Well, that's one victory.
I dined at the prison.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
No -- but I think I'm going to.
It's for the best.
I like football.
I'll take care of it.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
So there's a 20 percent chance he's <i>not</i> dead.
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
This <i>is</i> the most likely location--
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
One look through there and you would know why I can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
He's too tall.
What about this?
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
You're going to have to earn your supper.  I've got my final physical tomorrow.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
In a corridor.
Could be worse.  They could have found it in your eye.
Never stopped you before.  And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
Of course not.  But she's have to know eventually.
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?"  Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad.  How are you?"
I could always walk.  I've been faking it.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
Not that.
Yes.
You'll be next.
You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
Who are they?
We could go together one day.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
This is the only time you and I meet in public. Any business with me, handle it with him...
I get my own help.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
Stay clean.
What do you add up to here?
No. It's been a long time.
Couldn't handle it then. Now I can.
Really?
Better than I remembered.
I bought you a lot of new things.
You got the parole, didn't you?
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I mean it.
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
No scars.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Yeah.
Whatever you say.
Pull over.
We walk.
Might try that.
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
Just fine.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Just... tell us what you want.
A Ford... We have a Ford.
That's not possible. We can't leave here... we've got all this.
I'll tell you when.
What?
Good afternoon, Mr Brumby. Carter exits.
Good evening.
You stay in the car. I'll come and listen.  What you want to tell me, Thorpey?
I want to talk to you later.
Nicer than most.
Why'd you see him so regular?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Could you please put my glass on the table?
No. I didn't know that.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
Yeah.
Did my brother Frank find out?
Your brother? What you talking about?
And you didn't know her last name?
Yeah. A bloody funny thing!
Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
I left last year.
At me friend's house.
Wilton Estate.
Thanks.
Nobody seems to know.
Yes.
Where would I find him?
Who's Brumby?
I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Definitely.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
It'll cost you.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Ta-ra.
You're lucky. They kill as well.
That little shit!
Pension him off.
No. Are you tired?
Eric. Eric Paice.
It would be. If they were still living.
Oh, you've been watching television.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Good prospects for advancement, is there? A pension?  Do you know, I'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Yeah, I'll do that.  Told you it wouldn't take long, didn't I?
He said it'd be doing him a big favour.
They do that up North.
What for? Protective purposes?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
Shut up.
I had to.
You ever get 'em?
I...
For some sales pro...
No.
Yes.
What do you need? A telephone, some broad to say "Good morning," nothing...nothing...
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
What?
Just the act.
They...
What?
Huh.
Yes.
A buck a shot.
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would they come to me?
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
You went for it.
In the abstract...
How ya doing?
If anyone's going, I could use some coffee.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're right.  How are you?
What?  You can't do any what?
I am?
Down the street.
...what am I going to do all month...
Was I?
We had a robbery. 
Go to lunch, will you...
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
I don't want to go to lunch.
Where does he get off to talk that way to a working man?  It's not...
Did they get my contracts?
Who are you?
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
...you didn't close...
What two?
...you want to see the court records?  John?  Eh?  You want to go down...
All that I'm saying...
Moss.
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
Either way.  You're out.
I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. John. 
I can't do it, Shel.
John.  Listen.  I want to talk to you. Permit me to do this a second.  I'm older than you.  A man acquires a reputation.  On the street.  What he does when he's up, what he does otherwise...I said "ten," you said "no." You said "twenty." I said "fine," I'm not going to fuck with you, how can I beat that, you tell me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay. Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty percent, and fifty bucks a lead. That's fine.  For now.  That's fine. A month or two we'll talk.  A month from now.  Next month.  After the thirtieth.  We'll talk.
Can't do it.
I have to go... 
That if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
Yes, I am.
What are you talking about?
Well, hadn't it?
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
I...
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
And did they steal the contracts...?
Will you shut up, I'm telling you this...
Fuck is that supposed to mean?
...Shut up.  Decide who should be dealt with how?  Is that the thing? I come into the fuckin' office today, I get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
Last night, this morning.
Mmm.
Bullshit, you're...No.  That's raw... well, if I did, then I'm glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on them.  All on them, nothing on me. All my thoughts are on them.  I'm holding the last thought that I spoke: "Now is the time."  They signed, Ricky.  It was great. It was fucking great.  It was like they wilted all at once.  No gesture...nothing.  Like together. 
You're a client.  I just sold you five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I rub my head, throw me the cue "Kenilworth."
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Which...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
Ricky...
Yes.
Lingk.  James Lingk.
Who did she call?
To...you know.
To change our minds.
I don't know.
I told you.
What...?
What...?  Say the words.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
She told me not to talk to you.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
You hear what I said?
When...
Why not?
They took 'em...
They--excuse me...
You closed him yesterday.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I know.  How long will you be gone?
To do business.
I can help you.
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
We have no money for a rug.
Oh yes, the very best.
If you like, why not give me fifty dollars each to pay Fanucci.  I guarantee he will accept that amount from me.
Yes, thank you.
How are the kids?
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
Kids, why don't you go outside for a while?
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
He will grow strong.
Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before  You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable.  No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight.
We were all upset about that.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
We're making an investment in Havana.
Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
Nowhere, Mike.  I wanted to get a refill.  How about you?
The lawyer; Questadt, he belongs to Roth.
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side.
Goddamn it, where were you?
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
No Tom, just listen.  All my people are businessmen; their loyalty is based on that.  One thing I learned from my father is to try to think as the people around you think...and on that basis, anything is possible. Fredo has a good heart, but he is weak...and stupid, and stupid people are the most dangerous of all.  I've kept you out of things, Tom, because I've always known that your instincts were legitimate, and I wanted you to know very little of things that would make you an accomplice, for your own protection. I never blamed you for the setbacks the family took under Sonny; I know you were in a position of limited power, and you did your best to advise and caution him.  What I am saying is that now, for how long I do not know, you will be the Don. If what I think has happened is true; I will leave tonight, and absolutely no one will know how to contact me.  And even you are not to try to reach me unless it is absolutely necessary.  I give you complete power: over Neri... Fredo, everyone.  I am trusting you with the lives of my wife and children, and the future of this family, solely resting on your judgment and talent.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I want it met.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
He's going to try Panama...
Yeah, it was once.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
I don't think that's necessary.
He is, I believe, a brother.
The witness is excused; take him out.
Mr. Hagen's, ma'am.
I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
The money was sent.
Not good.
He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.
I deny his every charge.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
Good.
Sitting right behind you.
The same assurance we got from you.
What about Michael Corleone?
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
How much more a month?
Yes.
Not anymore you don't.  Doll.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
It's different.  He's a man.  And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
Your wife?
No!
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just that I was in the Marines.
No.  Iced tea's fine.
Really?
I returned recently from a stay in hospital.
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled?
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
"Bride of Frankenstein."
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
This David's a friend?
Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
I'm not, you know.
It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt.
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're talking through your hat now.
Something happened to him?
Clayton is fine.
David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
David produced her last picture.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
That's not the way he saw it.  To him, it was like his life never got started.  Nothing else really mattered.  Definitely not his family.
I'm very sorry.
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
What was that?
All right.
If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Oh no, my dear.  You look absolutely amazing.  There's no way I can compete with you.  The scene is yours.
Good night.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Will you tell me everything you remember about making "Frankenstein"?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
How's that?
Kip.
I don't know. But you shouldn't be here. Take care of your business. I'll give you 24 hours. And then I don't want to see your face. Ever again. Make a fool of me once, that's my bad. Make a fool of me twice. That's really my bad, and I'll kick your ass from here to India ...
You know my back.
Castlebeck.
Cadillac.
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
Where you been, anyway?
Lazy ... Lazy ... I ask you, Freb: what's the matter with kids today?
Hey, Donny --
Gray.
How you doing, man?
It's arright ...
Dignity...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
You remember that, Kip?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
I'm cool -
Yeah... You want a ride...
Hello, Memphis --
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
What do you got ... ?
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
"Shadow games?"
It's for assholes. The Legal Buck blows, Memphis.  You know that. Doing this, we make mad bank, my boys are down, the girlies come around and the boosts are a breeze. Yeah, sure, you're gonna get jacked-up every now and then - but ain't that a small price to pay for never, never-ever, having to say "paper or plastic?"
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
Yeah. He's knows of one all right.
On account of me.
A distinction worth noting ...
I put the boys on it. They're clever that way...
I take out my slim-jim...
You're going high-cheese, dude --
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
Now... I'm in ...
Of course you are. You're a professional...
And Tracy's on the move ...
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Yeah ... You -- ?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
No ... No... No ... Tell me what's gonna happen? Kip? Tell me. What's gonna happen?
No more shines, Billy.
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
She's screaming on the street and I mean loud, but she looked good. She had these violet eyes.  I remember she's screaming, but mostly I'm looking at her eyes. They were just like Elizabeth Taylor's. That's what everybody said.
The bag with the envelopes.
Oh that. Don't worry about that. Nobody's gonna steal it.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
Are you fucking nuts? That was forty, fifty thousand.  I need it. I was depending on that money.
Paulie was just talking about him.
The guy just sold the property. They're gonna build condominiums and I don't want anybody digging up the little bastard.
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
I better call again.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Yeah.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
I gotta go home and get my hat.
I hate to do dishes.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
He's with his friends.
Please?
Yeah.
You're fuckin' good.
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is this a bad time?
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
Fuck her.
Shut up.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
That you meet with me twice a week--
Half-red, half-black--
Pleasure to meet you.
Yeah, cured polio.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
Not much free time, Gerry. LAMBEAU Have you ever heard of a man named Ramanujan?
He was alive over a hundred years ago. He was Indian. Dots, not feathers...
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
That's great, Gerry, that there's interest-- But I'm not sure he's ready for that.
Who?
Einstein. Had two marriages, both train-wrecks. The guy never saw his kids, one of whom, I think, ended up in an asylum--
I do.
Well, you're the only one.
Look, I don't know what else I can say. I'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. But it's important to start early. I was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a Field's medal.
Is it Gerry? 'Cause I don't think it's fine with you. Give him time to figure out what he wants.
--Gerry--
Oh, that's nice--
--I'm not angry at you--
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
Why there?
About thirty million to one.
Who is he?
I go places, I interact.
What places?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
I did.
Whatever blows your hair back.
Free weights. WILL Oh yeah? Me too. What do you bench?
Crayons?
Maybe you married the wrong woman.
No.
My wife's dead.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
I was havin' a drink with my future wife.
What did you think?
Someone who challenges you in every way. Who takes you places, opens things up for you. A soul-mate.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
So you just want to use me and go?
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Pretty boring, I guess.
'Course I do, they're my brothers.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
No.
When?
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
I guess so.
No.
Come with me to California.
Yeah, I'm sure.
One, because I have a job here and two because I live here--
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
I'm not honest?
Reckon we better begin roustin' 'em out if we aim to get outa here by daylight. How about it, John? How you boys comin'? 
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
Let 'er go, Gallagher!
Now I can't breathe.
People done it. If they could, we could.
Lots must a died, too.
Fan-belt's shot.
What'd he look like again?
Was he bruised up this mornin'? About the face?
Sure, but what is this?
Two.
Can all of you work?
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Been out travelin' around?
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
It's hard to say. Stay here till mornin' an' then go on over to Uncle John's, I reckon. After that I don't know.
I ain't gonna run.
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Lookin' for a job?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
I didn't mean nothing.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Take her with you!
I like the tent better.
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
I'd a found you, Ma.
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Would you--could you see your way to cuttin' off ten cents worth?
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Well, I'm right here to tell you, mister, ain't *nobody* going to push me off *my* land! Grampa took up this land seventy years ago. My pa was born here. We was *all* born on it, and some of us got killed on it, and some died on it. And that's what makes it ourn--bein' born on it, and workin' it, and dyin' on it--and not no piece of paper with writin' on it! So just come on and try to push me off!
How's Granma since we got her in the tent?
I shore would like to stop here a while an' give her some res' but we on'y got 'bout forty dollars left. I won't feel right till we're there an' all workin' an' a little money comin' in.
Aw, sure. This here's jus' a part of it. Ain't no sense a gettin' scairt right off.
I wisht it was day.
Tom says if it's day it'll cut you gizzard smack out a you.  I seen a pitcher once. They was bones ever'place.
Won't they ketch us?
I seen 'em b'fore you did.
Ain't gonna get outa han'.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
--Stop it--
Computer guy.
Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
You could've been a contender, huh?
Then express yourself, Bob.
He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
You open 'em up and there's the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. It's the P.P.P. Six Day Week.
Here is now there. There is here.
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Well, there's not much to tell.
Bad television.
That'd be good.
Yes.
As long as I get the laugh.
Like love?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
Yes.
It's something I do...
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I'm staying here.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a union?
Thank you, no.
Those all seem kind of related...
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
--Nooo--
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
That's wonderful, Mom.
What's a revival tent?
No.
I'm a professional killer.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
That's up to Pilgrim.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Need a lift?
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
What?!
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Okay.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Mom?
Maybe they should put me down too.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
What?
You're right. Good.
What?... Oh baby...
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
What did he say?
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
You've already made arrangements!?
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Why?!
I'm not pretending anything!
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
What was it like?
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Problem is, there aren't many volunteers. He's already had enough to sink a battleship. You have a pin, just in case?
You!
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
You know her?
We should be fine, then.
Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
I don't know... You sure Tom said it's all right?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
So?
No, I'm just not that hungry.
I know. Amazing.
You shut up, stupid!
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
You ever miss it?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
It's cool!
Don't move!
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
Remember, hacking is more than just a crime. It's a survival trait!
Dragon book. Compiler design.
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
That's far out!
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
Roger.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Yeah, maybe I'm not. But we are, you asshole.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
You're not gonna win.
Do my ears deceive me?
Okay. I'll copy it.
I didn't know what was on it.
Razor and Blade! They're flakes!
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Yeah.
Thanks for your help.
Dreams?
We caught 'em.
I copied it from Ellingson, okay? They're asking me about it, alright? Will you take a look for me?
Phreak?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
From here I got access to every piece of data ever stored on Dade Murphy's parents. His parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. Hmm.
Yeah. To civilians. But they're hackers. But don't worry. All we have to do is launch the Da Vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Nonono, thank YOU!
Yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
So?
Oh really? Well, I'll just let you get back to little Ms. Hot panties.
Michael Myers.
She's not dead!
I don't know!
We're trapped in this house.
No. You son of a bitch!
Brady! Come with us.
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Why not?
How many bodies did you find?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
Drive Carefully.
No way. No how.
You dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw Myers.
We're not real sisters Jamie, but that doesn't mean I love you any less.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Double scoops?
What?
This is great Rachel. Come on.
Then we'll be safe?
Yeah.
Why?
All right.
You knew. You just didn't care.
You won't look pushy.
Leave Myers for the state boys.
Maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but I've got to try.
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Its true, Sheriff.
How do you know?
Dear God.
Be here in a minute.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
What's going on?
We just talked.
Fun-ny. See you.
Terrific. I've got three choices. Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda screw, or talk to you.
Behind that bush there.
Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Lies.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
He went out drinking beer with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late. YOU'LL have to call him tomorrow. Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.
Okay. First I rip your clothes off...
Yeah.
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Exactly what do you need?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
The bogyman!
And I'm here tonight and I won't let him get to you.
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
I've given them his profile.
There's nothing else I can do.
What did you use before?
Thorazin.
Your compassion is overwhelming, Doctor.
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We're actresses.
Ah! HOLLY  Now.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Hi.
You're out looking here?
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Bye.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
Oh, right.
Why, you know the situation.
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
But-but, but how about you?  Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
I don't know.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut.  I-it's all very...preconceived.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
Are you in love with someone else?
Are you?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Absolutely.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
But who?  Where did you meet him?
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Jesus...Jesus!
No--
Oh, God!  Do you hear a buzzing?  Is there a buzzing?
Like what?!  What?
Yes!
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Like what?
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
I know, I know.
Thanks, thanks.
Go right over there.
...from Mavis, also.
Now, Holly's not shy.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
She really does, though.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Well, how about this?
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
You know.
Look, everything's going your way.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  What do you, what do you do?  Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Yeah, really.  You do.  You do.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh.  Oh.
Well, it was just fabulous!  I'm, I, you know...
...but who cares?  It was just--  It was fabulous.
Oh, yeah?  What?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...read it over, and think about it.
A reward...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
<u>What</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
...I was <u>working</u>...
What have they got you doing?
You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward.
Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
Yes?
Why me?
...why?
Say it in English.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
COULD I GET A <u>DRINK</u>,  N'I don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for I'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with THE DIRTY DOZEN, one <u>Hispanic</u>, one <u>Librarian</u>, one <u>Jew</u>, and One from Column A, and One from Column...  Thank you.
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
Who called the <u>TV CREWS</u>...?
What's up...?
Their family owns...
Not with any certainty we...
The puppy comes back.  If you lie on the ground.  The Puppy with return.  Why? Do you know why...?  TO KILL YOU.  IT THINKS YOU HAVE FALLEN AND ARE POWERLESS. IT COMES BACK TO TEAR YOUR THROAT. THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As Lechter will return back.  You see?  To the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. He will return to savage our beloved Miss Starling.  Bring me a drink.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Exactly.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Try Barney Clark.
No, no, of course not.
Why?
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
...what's he got against you?
Well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a Dangerous Felon. Went in there with her gun, Came out, <u>without</u> the Felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
You want to <u>hold</u> him...?
And yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
Then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the Greater World...How pleased am I to see you looking so well...
...how so?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard?  Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
I'm a historian.  It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
I have had the honor. 
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
Sir, with all due respect....
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
And how did he do that?
ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I'll tell you what:  I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine...
...what?
Every suicide kills two.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
I am on the track of...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
...what did you want? 
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
His feelings do him honor.  And I have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great Clarice Starling... 
...but:  this particular statue...
I din't solve it, I didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  I just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  Facts, facts, facts.  <u>Facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
...would you use a small word?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Isn't it funny?  You can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me.  Which shows  a Strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   But you <u>shy</u> when I say the name of God.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Yowza--Only a virgin could answer that fast.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
I couldn't tell her...it's, it's too major...Jesus, I'm starting to believe in God and what's worse I think I like the guy. The lightning bolt was just a test, right?  Wendy and I--we're meant to be. I'm right, right?  I have to see her...
Say Hi for me.
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Not so secret anymore. Don't look all at once...behind the pine...Dorothy from Cabin Seven.
I just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--How do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?

Nobody really changes at summer camp. They merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  You can't be helped, Wichita. I'm not sure you can be punished, either. But let's find out...
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
I think your passion is terrific.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...
That's bullshit. Just shoot.
All right.
Color me educated. I learned high school happiness is for members only, Pauline Fleming wouldn't know reality if it lived in her uterus, and reality's name's Heather James. Also, J.D.'s a major creep.
Uh-huh.
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
He used a real gun. They should throw his ass in jail.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Oh shit, yeah.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Sure.
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
I don't know. Should you?
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
There's a big difference between the most popular girl in the school and dead sperm.
But before that, I'd like to see Heather Chandler puke her guts out.
Okay we'll use this. She won't be able to tell what she's drinking.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
It's one thing to want somebody out of your life. It's another thing to serve them a wake-up cup of Drano.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
That only proves my point more. The word is a badge for her failures at school.
Next channel, darling.
I'm doing a favor for Heather. A double date. I tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.
You kids are making too much damn noise.
Our sins? What sins? If you put a Nazi in a concentration camp, does that make you a Nazi?
Wha-at? Come on, there's another T.V. in the kitchen. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
You didn't say Simon Says.
You want to wipe the slate clean as much as I do. Okay, so maybe I am killing everyone in the school because nobody loves me. You have a purpose though! Remember? Let's face it, the only place different social types can genuinely get along with each other is in heaven.
You know what I want, babe?
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
playfully shoves his hand away.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
Yes . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
You need to get better first Trevor. Way better.  It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay?
Bull...
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
I have my connections
Really? Do tell.
How much time off?
As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's that?
And it shows. Least it did last night at the quarry. In a big way.
Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four.
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
Really, why's that?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
Ambulance.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
What do you mean?
God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease...
Hey you're the guy from down the hall.
Try stupid.
Come on, John, don't be an asshole. I don't like heights.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
Bail, for Chrissake!  I'm innocent!
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
You mean John Bubber?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
YOU KNOW WHY?  BECAUSE IT'LL BE AN <u>EXCUSE</u>!  IT'LL BE "BERNIE LAPLANTE EXCUSE NUMBER FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND SIX."  NO, FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE.  THAT'S HOW MANY EXCUSES YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, I KEEP TRACK OF THEM ELECTRONICALLY. I HEARD THEM ALL, BERNIE.
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
Turn that thing off.
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
Here!  Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks.  How much have you got, Chucky?  Give Mister LaPlante your money.
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
I could go to a movie Thursday night.  'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
Uh, no.
Vietnam!
Read it.  It'll be fine.
Because he was a <u>real</u> hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing.  He didn't expect the media to lionize him.  He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante....  For how much, LaPlante?  A couple of bucks?  Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
Said he's not an actor.
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
Who lost a shoe?  Wash your hands.
You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Never reach out!
They're really white.
Well, it's for a woman.
It's not going to happen unless you make it happen, my friend. You're going to have to assert yourself a little bit more.  <u>Show</u> your affection.
Right.
There's so much I want to say to her, it's all jumbled up in my mind, and I don't want her to misunderstand --
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
Holly -- that's not so.
And?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Here, take this out to the table.
RUDOLF!
Thanks, Mom.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
I know it's at the high end of our range --
Paul Newman in "The Hustler."
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
Oh -- great.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
C'mon.
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
Do you have enough money?
I have a cold.
What d'you want me to do, Neil? I've told you we'll get another dog.  What does EVERYONE want me to do?  You want to move back? Huh?  Would you like that?  Should we all just pack up again and MOVE BACK?!
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Right over here.
It's a double.
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
They appear to be authentic.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
I'd like you to see this.
This ties in with Nash.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
That's what I figured.  Well, I have a little home coming present for you.
I already told you.  I took a walk.
And Brenda?
You sure?
Most people are afraid of death.
I hear you.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
As friends -- always as friends.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
She's the King's cousin.
What do you think?
It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
How?
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
New York is dangerous place.
You talk to me -- but you don't answer my questions.  I guess I'll have to talk to Lieutenant Bedsoe.
I'm interested in mythology.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
No.
And the other one -- he is like you?
He will not stop until it is over.
How could they get by him?
I don't think it is a duplication.
Perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
This cannot be.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
The police still have a lot of questions for Russell Nash.
Yes.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Yes, sir.  But what about the disks?  If the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
You won't die if you let me help.
It's about Mars --
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
Jesus, first Mars, now you.  You two need anti-depressants.
They're fine.
How about the cop?
I gotta piss real bad.
You oughta try on the problem I got in here.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
Give up.
I'm getting a doctor!
We're trapped in a house.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
Okey-doke.
What do you mean?
Yeah.
I don't know how long I'll be stuck here.
Be quiet!  Listen!
Shh, they'll hear you!
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
If my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  Can't you make Dennis see that?
I can't go without Thomas.
Yes.
Another minute.  Please --
Junior Kim was DOA at the hospital.
I know the one.
I've done it once or twice.  I blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
Order your men to stand down.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
It's right in front of us.
What?
I asked you my name.  You just saw my commission slip.  What's my fucking name?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Yes, sir.
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
What was the response?
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
Canadian Club?
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't, I don't have the men.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
I understand General, but when I last talked to the president of Sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect Belgian property would be rewarded.
The front gate would be best, General.
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
Listen, you need me.
I am always glad to see you Paul.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
Promoted. House Manager.
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Of course.
The third floor are low class rooms.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
What?
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
What?
Please, please try one more time.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
You have taken business class?
How dead?
Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
Who is this Simon?
I'm confused.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket.
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
As a tumor.
You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
Left, goddamnit!
Take the gun.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
-- that's the fact, bud --
-- where the hell were you?
We're safe?
Run.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
Jesus!
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Then who are they?
-- in the act.
-- thank you! All the cards finally on the goddamn table!
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
And then what happens?
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
I never saw you --
-- no more --
Rewind that.
It works.
He must've beaten us all here!
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.
For the love of God....please...?
Sara...?
-- I'm coming --
These records only go back to 1880. But...  ...wait a minute...
The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself.  Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
I'll be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  And who died here.
There's no need to be.
Maybe it was Colleen...
No it won't - no it won't!
Yes.
Go to your room!  Now!
Where is she?
Why?
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
What will Aubrey think?
She's asleep.  I think that's what I need, too. I'm starting to see things.
Well what do you think it is?
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
She's gone!
Aubrey?!  Aubrey?!
What?
What about the other five percent?
Why?
We must return it, if you want your daughter back.
What's going to happen?
Yes, they are.
Runic?
There's something through that wall!
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
I know what I saw.
What can we do?
This is his first night on Earth.  He wants to close the door behind him. Like all Lieutenants, he covets command. There's a gateway to Hell through which he can be taken back.  He has to destroy it.
It's okay.  It's just someone burned me once.
Who's that?
Maybe he thinks it'll come back.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Oh, Terri ...
Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's ...
I took back everything bought on a whim, I'd have no business.  I ...
I don't know.  Maybe.
Uh-huh.
A prize?  For what?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well ... I'm fine. Things are great here.  Joey's going to get me a job at the TV station.  I'm meeting lotsa new people.  It's really great.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Gum.
Lousy day?  The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day.  What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant?  Believe me, it's overrated.
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
Hmmm, nasty little safe on the 7th.
Hey, I'm sorry, man.  I'm putting out a fire with kerosene.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
What am I doing here?  There are so many things I wanna do that aren't this.  Paint a lighthouse. Kiss a woman in Italy.
Why try?
Actually we're in Italy, Snickers, she said as if it made a difference.
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Anna, what are you trying to say...
I know, I know, your Eminence, just say "God go with me."
Never, why do you ask?
Delivers up to ten at night.  The Pope has an obsession with his Easter Seals.  It's actually not that an unusual set-up.  The secret passageway on the other hand....
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I don't steal stuffed elephants from little girls.  And I buy my own clothes.  My life's a little boring...
How long were you in?
Let's just say, I never saw E.T.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Selfish attitude?  I'm just some guy who wants a little nap and a cappuccino for when he wakes up, not too much foam...
Fits my new image.  A thief for the masses.  This is one job I'm not going to feel guilty about enjoying.  Gum.
Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.
Poor baby..... Here, Bunny.
Uh, yeah.  Cut to the chase.
You go back, you won't be alone. You'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate.  You're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "Alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. Depressing.
I used you as a diversion.  while you were getting captured upstairs, I was shredding documents in the basement.  Deep down, I guess I was just jealous.  You were one incredible thief...
Employer?  The president?
If you do anything to my friend...
The Hudswinger!
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
Why yes, do you know it?
Well, I --
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
I know that, Amy.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Consider this my resignation --
Tell me about it.
...Geez.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Get up!
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Yeah?
I haven't had --
I --
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or...  ...'schmoe'?
You're fired.
Thank you, Alma.
She was very sick and then she went mindless, Miss.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
They even cure nonsense, Miss Betsy.  Mama Rose was mindless.  I was at the Houmfort when the Houngan brought her mind back.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Is this disease common in the tropics?
Yes.
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
It'll wait.
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
Not to a nurse.  Sleep is a cure.
Please, Wes, do as I ask.  You must rest, you must sleep.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
I imagined this so differently...
I believe there's a kinder name for it, Wesley. At St. Thomas, it's called the Institute for Mental Therapy.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
Betsy, tell them about the Houmfort.  Tell them what you saw there.
Gotcha George, not a problem. Tomorrow. Hey, you want to start covering the old filmed entertainment sector yourself?
Up the organization!  Bastard.
Don't see how. I think the public's had its fill of this gangster stuff. No, trust me -- disaster pics. And air hockey.
No thank you. We should be off.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
Oh not again Elena! If we've got problems, why can't you just come out and talk about them.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
I'm not surprised.
In the car.
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
All the more reason for this little heart to heart... great.
Ben--
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Have I noticed anything? I'm not married to her Benjamin, you are. I think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
Huh?
That's besides the point.
-- 73, and divorce is as easy as paying off a traffic ticket, and for crying out loud, Ben, be a man and just get it over with. I would have if I'd had the chance.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Darn it, Dave.
You know, it's a California thing. That scuzzy husband of hers dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in L.A. you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and then at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out and go home with whoever's keys they've got. Anyhow that's how she met this Rod person or whatever his name is and he's left his wife and she's packing for California. Irwin is devastated. It's so ironic.
It was lovely!
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Mom. Are you ok?
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Forget how to ride a bike.
But not too ashamed.
I gotta get to English class.
Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
Aha! I could sense the vibe.
Moisture! Moisture!
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
Thanks for the advice dad.
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
Geometry?
Out.
You like him? He worships you.
I don't know. Dad seems a little weird.
Hey Sandy.
Yeah? See ya.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Actually...
Do it again.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
The Puffins and the Hawks.  We're in extra innings.  The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
That must have been awful for you.
Then change it.
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You heard me that time.
Best friend?
I suppose.
Did you have sex with her?
Yes.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
But how did you come into existence?
Are you the leader of tis group?
Then there is nothing.
Then blame the one who made her...
That's what the one who made me said.
I can't save her.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
What a pair we are. We deserve each other, don't we?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Then I hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
What died tonight inside that room was not that woman. It will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. What has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
But why do you want me?
Because you're as strong as I was when I was alive.
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
I tried...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
So shall we begin?  What do yo do?
Absolutely. I was watching you watching me. I was waiting for you in that alleyway. And then you began to speak.
Perhaps lucky for both of us.
The same way you do it. A series of simple gestures. Only I moved too fast for you to see. I'm flesh and blood, you see. But not human. I haven't been human for two hundred years.
You can't look at them...
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
Yeah, right -- whatever.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
Yet. Nothing yet.
No means yes.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can.  And I don't want to have to say I told you so...
Karla! You promised.
Okay, I won't.
The dockhand guy. Hanging by his neck from up there.
I'm right here. Grab my hand.
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
This weekend?
It beets being on the mainland.
Julie, you said you were tired. Waybe you were dreaming.
Did you get help?
I trusted you.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Rio, baby!
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
See, it's not a macho thing. It's about equilibrium in your inner ear. You could've used a patch, but it's too late now. Get used to it.  Some folks just can't sail.
So why are you still here?
Good winds and bad winds!
I'm afraid so. There were rumors people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
Of course. Tomorrow, perhaps, before I go?
Sharp, shiny teeth -- and they creep up to your bed --
Poor Cathy --
I was looking for you.
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
It was, the plague
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you - I'll warn them against you.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Because he was a brave man - because I liked him -- I came here to be sure.
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
There's no one there - nothing but the caves and the dead.
We have no time for that.
If she looked like Thea, she must have been beautiful.
Why in the world can't you?
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
All right  all right.
Well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . .  . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.  What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right.  You've got your wish. You've never been born.
Our clothes are dry.
It isn't me!
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
No, of course not.
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . . 
I'm not supposed to tell.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
I know that girl!
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Of course it's the place.
Mother? What do you want?
Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody I know.
It will?
Uh-huh.
Fine.
A cattle boat?
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Hmmm?
Well, she's not crazy about him.
No.
Oh . . .
Still after that first million before you're thirty.
What's that?
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
When?
Hello?
Have you notified the police?
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
If I told you it might not come true.
I'm going to scream!
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
Where's your coat and hat?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Oh, George, George!
Oh, shucks . . .
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
We better go back in.
We're hung up on something.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
You bet.  Hang on....
The rope!  The rope!
N-o-o-o-o-o-o....
Of course not,  They're closed. Phil Fogarty's place.  He'll do it for me.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
First things first.
The what?
What shark?
We don't know that, do we?
You don't tell me my job, and I won't tell you about yours, okay?
What makes you think there might be?
That's it?  Probably?  Look, sharks are attracted by blood, and thrashing around....
Sound?
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Home it is.
Door's locked.
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
In the city, it happened all the time -- some Kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the Brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies.  Call the cops.  What are we, immune?
That's great too.  Gorgeous.
We're alone.
I know, I know....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Yeah?  Then what?
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
I'm not crazy about blind dates.
Great.
Nope.
Huh?
What the hell is it?
It'll be fun, come on!
No.
You're going sailing.
Yeah.  Down there.
Don't forget you have your brother.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
... Hutton.  He really pisses me off.
No, you don't need all that starch.  You're getting too fat.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
Thank you.
No, you're not.
Sounds wonderful.
I can't!  My dad had it, and I don't know if you can inherit it or what, but I got it, and I hate it.  I can't stand it!
You wanted to know about a cave?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
The only Great White in captivity, Calvin.  All those people standing in line...
Make a lovely item for "Good Morning, America"
Because I don't trust you, that's why.
Kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
You're a strange man, Mr. Hutton.
Sure am.
That's too bad.  I don't like water.  I don't like being around in.  I never go in it.
Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Taking my boyfriend to the airport.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
But you always let me....
I don't want to.  I want to swing....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
We forgot to stop at the store.
Tell Matt he should be here....
They're at the beach....
Whatever happens next.....
We'll divert it...We'll do something....
Stop what?
A small one...Your brother won't be here....
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
What?
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
You could teach...You could....
Will you let me finish.  I've been working on this all day.
I'm tired of hearing about it. There's no shark.  Sean wasn't killed by the same shark.. Dad didn't die because of it...It's all wrong... Some fantasy you've concocted...You keep bringing it up.
I'll wear my rubbers...I'll be careful ...I'll be....
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
There's nothing to be sorry about.
You're the man who drives the plane.
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Still tagging conch?
We'll be done pretty soon....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
Try the area around the wreck....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Yeah, well, just stop yelling.
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
What?
Holy shit!
We got it together, Jake....
The shark will get it for us.
Who?
'It got us in hot water...We should have been there for Carla....'
Don't be so down, man.  Money's gone...Shark's gone...We're back to conch...We've got it made....
Stop that!
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
Here it comes....
Who grows more beautiful....
Happy birthday, darling. ...
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'll take care of it.
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
Since when did you drink diet soda?
I need some security. I don't trust you anymore.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
I guess by the bed.
Bits.
What is all this Jennifer stuff?
No, Sir.
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
No.
I am calm .. <u>I am calm</u> ..
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
What are you looking for?
Wrong cabinet.
I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
Oh.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
Really? What did he say?
He said you're quite chubby. And you have a nervous tick.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Why?
Then why didn't he kill me?
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
I'm already walking. Where is it?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
Okay, this is working.
You are not a loser.
Jerry!  Do something --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
You're imagining it.
My son... my mind...
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Yeah, thanks.
No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas.  I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
What?
Fine, I just --
And I appreciate that impulse.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
I don't need you to "stick."
You want...
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow!  You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Oh my God.
Maybe you don't.  Because it's not just the money I deserve.  It's not just the "coin."  It's the...
No tell me. _ 84.
It's a risk.
You don't want to go home, do you?
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Why not --
I think so.
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
Well.  Good luck with that --
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
To the pools.  Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
But wait...
Don't be silly.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always.  We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
Yeah I know.  I did.
From what I understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.
He's this way.
That one time was just the bumper.
I don't remember
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Dr. Grant was.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Not if it can't dig.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
Baryonyx?
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the...
Really?  What do you do there?
You think they could talk to each other?
It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park, you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils are out. Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
The last of my breed.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
But then you never get to go in space.
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
I guarantee it'll be worth your while.
Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe. These guys are really good. One of them was a Green...
I have never been on this island!
Stan.
Just a little bit too much, I think.
If the nest is upwind, so are we. When he comes back, he'll know we're here before we have a chance.  The truck --
Former academic.  Now I actually make things.  I don't just talk.
It doesn't matter what I think.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
So what?
I want to see the nesting ground!
Not without a shot of the nest.
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
I'm fine... I'm fine...
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Piss.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You're going too?
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
This is single-wall construction! It's just a shack!
What's that?
So that others would know about this place?
Don't let it out of your hands again.  Can the kid walk?
John Hammond.
Current evidence seems to be to the contrary, wouldn't you say?!  GIVE IT TO THEM!
Maybe.  Maybe not.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
You're sure we have to?
Damn!
What now?
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Shhhhh!
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
That's right.  But they never attack the same place twice.  They were testing the fences for weaknesses. Systematically.  They remembered.
The other car!
- - shut up.
I understand that.  I'm sorry to hear that. We'd be well advised to deal with this situation now.  The insurance company - -
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
No, we don't have any animatronics here.  These are the real miracle workers of Jurassic Park.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Tim.
Yes it is.
"Thunder lizard!"
This is a seventy-seven ton animal.  Come on over, Lex! Just think of it as a big cow.  Look at it's teeth?  Come here, girl.  This is a seventy-seven ton animal. Just think of it as a big cow!
Tim, you're gonna have to let go.  I'm going to count to three.
Tim, you're going to have to let go of the fence.  Tim! Get down right now.  Get off the fence!  Now!
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
I must've touched something.  This happens all the time. It must be my fault.  Machines hate me.
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
What?  What can we do?
For a further three years.
After careful consideration, Dr. Grant - - so have I.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
Yes.
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Thanks, Steve.
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
Hey Lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Really? How much?
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
You want to put in chain saws?
That's not true...
Great.
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
Where's Ken? Is he all right?
What about that other guy?
His camera... it's still recording.
Insomnia. Not unusual for someone in his situation.  Not to mention he's a bed-wetter.
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Well, I definitely feel sorry for you.  August fourteenth, 1956... Jason was brought in by his mother, who said the boy hadn't slept for two weeks. Doctor prescribed Valium...
I don't "rationalize" anything. I'm his lawyer -- he's my client. That's all.
No. You've told me all I need to know.
Uh-huh...
_It's a second REM pattern_.
That doesn't make sense.
I was there once... that was enough. Besides... I have to go out to Jason's house tomorrow.  They're... digging up some new evidence.
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
So you think it might counteract Krueger's ability to make us hallucinate?
For the moment! You've only got about two minutes left! Hurry! Ruby takes off towards the Cineplex...
No, no, no -- quite a long time, yes.
You could say we represent the <u>un</u>official view of a well-ordered society.
-- Small.
Naturally? -- that's not the word I would have chosen.
Success or nothing?
The Kafka men are famous for it, you know.  Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
It's what I'm paid to do.
You keep too much to yourself -- you're a lone wolf.  It makes me uneasy, and if it makes me uneasy I can't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees.
In a small way.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
I know.
One of you must be mistaken.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men.  And yet you're able to remain an outsider.  With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
At the cost of others?  You accuse people of murder without trial -- apparently without irony.  Did you go to the Castle with Eduard?  Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all -- even before or after he got there.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I -- I found your jailer.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Where you've been employed for seven years.
Was he depressed?
No.  He didn't seem to be.  Do you think he drowned himself?
No, I suppose not.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Anyway, I'd like you to reflect that in me you have -- I won't say a friend, because we're complete fencers, of course -- from distinctly incompatible social classes -- but to some extent, shall we say, an interested third party.
That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth.
It's a farce.
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
It's gone out so quickly?
-- You mean my Chief has it.
Orlac is an account?
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
Where do our records go to in the Castle?
I could always apply there.
I understand he was wounded in the lung.
What's to become of us now?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
We should never have come! I pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Yeah.
I'd just be guessing.
Guess!
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Why isn't he locked up?
What was better? I made better bait?
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
No, I'm look --
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
-- OK?
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
No.
You said you wanted these.
Try some other ways. 
Well --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Don't worry.
But if it's someone else I do.
How?
We did this before.
Yeah.
Is that all you have to say?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
I was wondering what that was.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
You could at least look at me!
I don't think so.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Goodbye, Pete.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
Town Police.
We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky behavior, but there's no evidence of murder - there's not even a body.
Nobody's seen that.
Oh, yes.  Won't you come in.
What does?
The prospect of losing my child.
What if she forgets?
C'mon, Billy.  I'm trying to work for God's sake...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
That's okay...
Sleep tight.
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
What don't you understand, pal?
Who will read me my stories?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.  Does she have a lover?
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I don't recall.
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer. You have just rewritten matrimonial law.  You were both divorced, Mrs. Kramer.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
Fine.
Such as?
What?
Listen, Ted...I just want to tell you, when old man Schmidt retires next year, I've got a pretty
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
Do you?
Kramer, I'm sorry.  All I was trying to do was--
Three months.  How can you tell?
Do you want the kid or don't you?
When Joanna--  my ex-wife--when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage...Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true.  There were a lot of things I didn't understand-- a lot of things I would do different if I could.  Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change...But we can't.  Some things, once they are done, can't be undone.  Joanna says she loves Billy.  I believe she does.  So do I.  But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue.  The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy...When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right.  But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?  I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent:
The judge went for motherhood straight down the line.
Don't worry.  I'll get the money.
She's the mother.  That means she's within her legal rights.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Joanna said that?
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
How many onions does it say to use?
Ted, I just heard...
No cried?
Can I free the prisoners?
Yes.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
Is that big?
It is an island. American territory.
Where is Alsace?
In the Americas.
Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
I have one more piece of news. A baby is coming.
Does he have the spot?
I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
Where is Poland?
Oh, but you do, Kundun. Who else would be here?
Oh well, I'm sorry.  I didn't realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
You're to wait right here until the police show, you're under full house arrest.
And law enforcement, such dangerous work.  The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Mr. Cyr!
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
Keystone what?
And you like me.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
It came from across the lake.
Then do it!!
So profound and fat.
Bastard bit my chopper.
We're ready.
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
As if.  Will you miss me?
Could we have intercourse?
Guess I finally got bit.
Yes, it <u>did</u> seem prehistoric but I'm sure he just carried the thing for luck.  Not that it <u>worked</u>, obviously.  It probably somehow got lodged into his body.
What?
There <u>have</u> been Northern sightings. But not <u>this</u> North.
Good.
That's probably good.
What?  Why... people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would...  Does it show?
What?
<u>No</u>!  You might think they're Godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
He <u>has</u> been going after everything. It <u>could</u> work.  But this is not a happy cow.
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Doesn't <u>look</u> like it.
Alright, Ms. Paleontologist.  I wanna know why that monster is here.  You got a theory?
Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
<u>There</u>?  That's the morgue.
Seconds.  Three, four.
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
We're staying in <u>tents</u>?
You threw it at me!!
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
Look.
You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
This is what we do?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Where?
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company.
The psychiatrist - Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages.  It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice.
Point taken.
You'll back me up with some paperwork?  Then I'll try. But wouldn't this have more weight coming from the Senator herself?
Let's get some coffee and talk.
Starling -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Not lately. But maybe someday.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
I don't know. Is it?
That is both impudent and untrue... Tell me, how did you feel when you viewed our Billy's latest effort?  Or should I say, his "next-to-latest"?
A moth... How did you predict that?
That's just part of the island. It has a very nice beach. Terns nest there.
Killed outright?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
No. Tell me why.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
A cattle ranch?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Then tell me how.
Yes...! They were screaming.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure!  I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, red men in the wild!
Why did they turn back?
On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring...  to my blood...  ...than any imagining could possibly have been...
Because what I am interested in is right here...
No. I will find you.
Our father? Did you see my father?
Alice?
I have nothing to go back for.
There was no letter.
You still have an aversion to the water?
Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let those whom you trust, your father, help settle what's best for you. In view of your indecision, why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine?
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
: Only one or two loads.
Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell them for gold to the white man?  Would the Huron have greed for more land than a man can use? Like Francais Black Robes do?  Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But sell the fur to the white man for gold?...  Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs?  ...Magua's heart is twisted. He would make himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs?  ...Magua's way is false. It is like the white sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness and shame. Is there another way? I don't know.  I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican people... Let the children of the dead Munro go free... I speak the truth.
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Webb's at Edward?
The decision is final.
Sir!
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My colors?
Allow me to consult with my officers.
Granted, Monsieur.
Why Sixpack?
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Intelligence may not be the right word...
Today...with DeJesus.  That was smart thinking to get him inside...
Seeing how my stock's doing...
Can't we fix it?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Twenty minutes...
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
I signed-up for the stock option.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
...and a Russian grandmother...
It's Hazy...It's got him! Stay here and don't let him out.  I'm going to get the Doc.
And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...No, thank you. I'll take my chance down here.
...It has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
The good doctor signed our death warrant.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Probably no longer than four weeks.
That inspires confidence, that does.
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.
It's a Samoan pub.
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Where did he get a hundred grand?
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Yes?
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.
No Harry, you can't.
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?
You had better be careful.
That's no way to answer the phone.
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta find 'em.
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be preferable to death by Hatchet.
Er well, yes we do.
No.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
Why, what's up?
You will what?
Well, perhaps you can help?
Lives and learns doesn't one.
What are you doing, Plank?
You know how much it is, Nick.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind that, what about the money?
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; it's in all our interests.
What about all the gear?
Er, fertilizer.
So?
They stole our land--
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
Do whatever they tell you--
Yes, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Yeah.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Same weight I always was.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Suppose not.
Come on in--
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
So I'm part-Indian?
My father.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
Good deal you were born down here, then.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave-- [There's been a bad accident--]
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
'57, 1 believe--
You go by your old house?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
Not if I can help it.
What do you think?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
They've got my Amado.
Got him here?
I'll see what's going on.
Are you okay?
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Yeah?
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
I haven't seen anybody come by.
We'll get 'em--  So you livin' out here now?
For Frontera? Hell, I can't remember dates no more. I do recall it was after an affair of the heart had gone sour on him. He almost took some poor fella's head off at the Legion in Arroyo Grande, and figured it was time to move on.
Me neither.
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
He's gonna find out.
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
You heard right.
Nope.
A Nix specialty?
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Death.
What about death?
It's an illusion.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
So tell me where Nix is buried.
What is he?
Be ready.
Yes.
We haven't slept in the same bed for years.
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
It was more than that, I think.
I wasn't.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
Quaid and Jennifer--
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Hang on!
Yes.
I left three messages already.
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
I'm here to offer you a job.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
Are you a gambling man?
I don't think the dead much care.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
Yes.  It's regrettable
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
You want more money, is that it?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Help me.
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
The Puritan?
That.
For what?
Now I'm going to have to kill you.
And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix.
Help me.
And he didn't have them?
Jesus!
I can't... I can't go any further...
What?
Who is she?
Who's not?
And he's dead?
You want to be like that, Swann? Mud and shit?
Binding you.
We're looking into it Bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show Friday, apparently it's a really big deal, he's the Johnny Carson of Japan.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Yeah, you don't remember?
I don't remember.
Oh, for her show?
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
But, I'm mean.
That's too scary.
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Four.
Fuck off.
Around.
Tomorrow.
Yes.
Ok, bye.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Is there anything I can do?
Hello?
Fine. Is it going ok?
What?
Ok.
Good...I'm tired.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
It's ok if you are.
Sure.
It's amazing  there!
Hmmm.
I spaced out.
When did they find her?
I'm just temporarily off my game.
Must be a spare set.
Peter, are you okay?
And how would you describe him?
Just me.
You're aware that this woman was party to the so-called exorcism.
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
I certainly hope you're not lending any credence to this.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
There is a medical explanation for everything that happened.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
But bad judgement.  And now you see how dangerous the consequences can be.
You ready?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
...art sank, sun set, ark sank again...
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
I'll bet.
I cranked it all the way up.  Nothing but hum.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
I'm going to look around.
When's your birthday?
Maybe that's my problem.
I don't know.  Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
Terrific.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
He's still at the bank.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
Need any help?
I can manage.
Maybe she is.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
You're a caterer?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
You're cold?
Huh?
Shh.  It's okay.
I don't wanna see that.
Mom tell you to do this?
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
And he's fine, girl.
Too many times.
I was just showing emotion.
She hates all freshmen.
I was just playing ball.
Just wanted to say good game.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
Big-ass titties?
Didn't know you cared so much.
Who's Spalding?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I'm warning you.  You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
With a jacked-up attitude.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
That what you think?
What'd it say?
Then prove her wrong.
My court, I go first.
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
I've been trying to find you all day.
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
Least she had time for me.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
Least you got your priorities straight.
Few days ago.
I forgot, "Q-man."
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Like what?
Maybe go back to school.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Better late than never, right?
What?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay.  I mean, I was lost.  So you are forgiven.  But that was five years ago.  I moved on.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So?
There's so many I just can't keep track.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
Yeah.
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
Why?
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I ain't a damn liar.
You want me to fuck off?
ooohhhhhh no.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well can you connect me to someone else?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
Thank you, Chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Don't yell, honey.  Please don't go crazy --
No one else in there with you?
I'm sorry.
Did you hear what I said?
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Arlight, then.  Cheers.
-- is not my boyfriend.
Many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but I have to tell you that, being a police officer, I've seen it happen: Young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, I'm gettin' a call on the radio, I got a 422 --
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
Okey-doke.
Thank you.
Ok, then.  Keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
You wanna go on a date with me?
Please, yes.
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Billingsley's?
It's my favorite place --
Bye.
...yeah...
What?
ok.
You're a police officer.  You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
That was so great what you just said.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
What's your name?
I'm, I need to go, I'm gonna --
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
Son, don't --
We gotta get his money so we can get outta here -- we gotta --
I'm not mad, son, I will not be mad at you and it's ok and please put it down and I won't be mad and I won't --
It's ok, boy.
Put me on the payroll, find out, find out wassup --
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
Sorry, little man.
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Go. Hurry up. Let's go.
-- watch the mouth, homeboy, I don't need to hear that word --
Finish it up without the lip.
Whatever that meant, I'm sure it's real helpful Ice-T.
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
What happend?
Fine.  Phil, you still there?
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
Nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
Picky, picky.
Shall we drink to that?
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...I'll tell you the answer: I'll tell you, 'cause I had that question.  I had that same question....Carbon. In pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "Well...all we were asking was the common element, Donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, Kids!  Full of useless thoughts, eh?"  Thank you. Thank you.  And the book says: "We may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  And NO IT'S NOT DANGEROUS TO DO THAT.
Solomon: I am in the middle of so much. So much in my life and this is -- If you do this, if you fire me: I Am Fucked. I can't really explain much, but please, please, I've worked here for four years, four years I've given you and I'm, I'm, I mean what?  I'm sorry I was late. I had a car accident.  I accidentaly drove into a seven-eleven. It was not my fault.
He has Phil right now.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
You do?
Where is he?
I wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
....getthat on the tv....there...
Hi.  Is Frank there?
No.
Is this 509-9027?
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
I'm not sure I hear a question in there?
Hollywood, mainly.
Does you mother still work?
Are you close?
She's my mother.
...this close...
...are you Phil...?
...uh-huh...
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
I don't think, he can't...
I don't have to answer your questions.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I preffer to stand.
And what about screaming?
I said: I DON'T KNOW.  You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
Marcie - CALM DOWN. CALM DOWN and don't do this. I want you to stay --
...you know...
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
I'm sorry, Stanley.
Love you too..
Yeah.
Yes.
Who?
No.
How long with Paula?
You should know better.
I'II go....is it...back here?
No.
What's MOW?
No they don't --
I can't.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
mmmhmm.
Must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  You could have quite a party all that stuff....
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Ok.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
What do you do?
-- the fuck are you talking about?
I'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, I don't want to be the one always --
I'm fine. nothing.
Stand up.
I said I'm fine.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
No.  No.  I have to do this on my own.
It's raining frogs from the sky.
Nothing... Nothing.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
He who is not with us is against us.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
About to hang himself, I should think.
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
But --
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Perhaps he serves a different king.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
Everyone back.
Really?  If you can name me one thing, one single thing, that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips, I will buy you a new cathedral.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
I expected action.  There was no killing, no fighting, I was useless.
Why didn't you say so?
He is right, d'Artagnan.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Fromberge...?!  At the front?!  No.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I came to see you safely out.  Check for yourself.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
I suppose... it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison, who pass such beauty every day, and never see it.
What is that?
Whose rooms are those?
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort.  She is betrothed to Raoul, the son of Athos the Musketeer, who has served France through many tribulations.
Your Majesty has had many women --
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
It... was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
It shall be done, your Majesty.
Yes, your Majesty.
Yes, yes, go on.
Well yes, of course, Majesty, and I'm sure they are content... except that... well, they are starving.
Enough of this, our dinner waits.
You would do that, your Majesty?
No, you may wait behind the screen.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
Every step of the way.
Where are you?
Did you report it stolen?
He busted the back window with his feet, and fled on foot.  We pursued him into this warehouse - but he's - gone, south - maybe a couple of miles if he's fast -
He must have got the keys... off Stanton.
I don't know, shit.  Maybe she was looking for love...
Did you start out area six?
And he took a swing at you?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
And what did he do to the girl?
Nothing!  He didn't do nothing!
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
No.
Yeah...they did.  One girl...
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
I have nowhere else to go, Tubbs, I need your help!
I gave all that up.  I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment.  It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore...  ...some things never change, I guess.
Both at the same bank...
And look at the balances...these aren't police salaries...
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
Screw him!
He doesn't think you run mind games on him.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
That could be the tip of a 't.  Here and here. And here.
Library of Congress.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
I am all right.
What do you want to do?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
...I'm going to see Lecktor.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
What's that?
See if there's another label underneath.
This is our boy...!
He went to the men's room.
The activities of nocturnal animals.
When do you need it?
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
In the kitchen.
Who?
No.
Shut up. Stop. Stop it.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
Yes.
As long as it's on soft paper.  You may...  Find this curious.
No.
Uh... sure...
Three, four hours.
I have to catch Federal Express within about five minutes. I'd be immensely appreciative if you'd pull it out of her Rolodex for me.
Okay.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
He's white and six feet tall. You haven't told me anything yet.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
No.
What did he want?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Me, too. And very erotic...
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
Blue, then.
I love you...
Will...
What's this Mama shit?
Okay. They're full of shit and they make me sick...
Yes. Is Molly there?
Go on to the house...
My name's Will Graham. I...
I figured I'd ask you...
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
How?
It's in the transcript. What does it matter now?
Pray tell.
What disadvantage?
You're insane.
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
It's a veddy small island in de Caspian Sea.  It sunk. GEORGE Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.  Well, look, I'm probably out of my mind -- but I think you're very interesting.  If you ever need representation... we should talk.
And that's great.  But do it in LA and New York!  There you experiment! Show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  I don't care!
I don't know!  Andy... you need to look inside: Who are you trying to entertain?  The audience... or yourself?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
But I feel you're extending this philosophy to real life.  It's obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the level anymore.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony better than you do.  Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!
Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines, and he's amazing!  He rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
Oh!
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
No no no, it's not sex!  I mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it's just wrestling.
Yes.
Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I'll go in the ring, and I'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  Then you'll come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and we'll get married on Letterman, like Tiny Tim did on Carson... right there on the show!  What do you say???
And you're just poor white trash!
They're asking for it.
It's working for Elvis.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
Positive.
But my neck hurts... and I have a slight cough...
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
We have no choice but to continue as planned.  Deploy the sentinels. Immediately.
I'm just doing my job.  You gimme that Juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
No way.  Not possible.
Should Tank I.D. it?
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
You don't, do you?
Hear what?
Sorry.
Any time.
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
You have to focus.  There is a phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can make it.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Who's coming for me?
I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
... Yes.
No.
Why not?
Do you want to know what it is?
You've never used them before.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
How does she know?
Yes.
That I would find the One.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
Do it!
You're the Oracle?
Shit, I'm sorry.
How did you know...?
I'm not the One.
How do you know that name?
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
From what?
Easy, Neo.  Easy.
What?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
There has to be something that we can do.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
What?
Where is it?
Neo, this has to be done!
Duck!
Tank, it's me.
Thanks.
Nothing's private...
You got sparklers?
You sure?
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
Salute!!!
'Thou art then a king?'
Jewish...
How do you know?
Listen, I appreciate it, but I'll handle it myself.  I'll write.
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Don't worry.  I can handle it.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
What you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
Mind your own business.
This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame.
Ok, how's everything going?
Sell 'em if you can't smoke them.
You seen Johnny Boy tonight?
Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean...
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Yeah, where's the rest?
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Hostess?
You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it.
Charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... I mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
No...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
Of all people.  Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara.  C'mon.
For God's Sakes...I told you before...nothing.  Charlie, I can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
Count it.
We'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Shut up.
Sure.
Thanks.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Very.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
We've got some things to discuss.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Do they, m'dear?
That you've been to Susan?
Honey --!
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
I would say, sir, it is right up there with Jif and Skippy.  But miles ahead of Peter Pan.  Like a taste?
He'll wait --
'Here'?
Not good, not bad, you know what we got?  Nothing.  No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives.  Nothing.
What'd it say?
It's going to be great --
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
Me, too.
As close as a deal could be.
Olympic.
I am now.
Sit down, Drew.
Well now it's undone, okay?  Forget Bontecou!  Scrub him!  I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
For how long?  And why?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
What you then?
No.  Nothing.
No problem.  I'll leave you two alone.  I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
I don't have any.
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Watch me do what?
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Girlfriend?
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
How beautiful.
No worse than it gets for me.  I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
'Love will find out the way'.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I didn't know her.  The body I took knew her.  The man she met in the coffee shop this morning.  I - uh - took him.
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
Not this.
Can you keep a secret?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something.  I know I'll be seeing you.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
What way would you put it?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
'Spooning'?
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Yeah.
Which is what?
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
-- An IRS man.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
That's me.
Then don't.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
Try.  Because 'if you haven't tried, you haven't lived'.
What you were talking about.
No, you're not.  You're trying to 'handle' the situation but this is the one situation you knew you never could handle.
What do you mean?!
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Sure.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over.  Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Yeah.  I guess so.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
What were you going to say?
Aw, you're tough.
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
The fireworks are about to start.
I could be her.
Because I like you so much.  You have coffee here every morning, don't you?  If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
As requested.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
Hi, Leonard.
Yeah?
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
Quiet!
Strip!
Look, there's two hundred grand stashed in the car. Just take it!
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
So I just take your word?
Your wife?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
How?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
Sweet.
Dying.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
Did Teddy send you?
Shut your mouth!
You're in a playful mood.
Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
Yeah. I think it was your sinister mustache that got him.
You like it? Let's trade.
Prove it.
Who's she?
From who?
Why are you following me?
I won't be happy until you leave town.
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
How do you know this?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
Wouldn't be appropriate.						*
Like you've told yourself. Over and over. Conditioning yourself to believe. "learning through repetition" -
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
I guess I can only make you believe the things you want to be true, huh? Like ol'		   * Jimmy down there.
My mother calls me Teddy. I'm John Edward Gammell. Cheer up, there's a lot of John		    * G's for us to find. All you do is moan.			* I'm the one that has to live with what			 * you've done. I'm the one that has to put		    * it all together. You just wander around			* playing detective. You're living a dream,		   * kid. A dead wife to pine for and a sense		    * of purpose to your life. A romantic quest		   * which you wouldn't end even if I wasn't			* in the picture.							    *
Why would I have a gun?
And...?
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
What do you think?
Nothing.  As in "free, gratis."
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Died in childbirth, having me...
Is it December?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Good samba dancing...?
Maybe I'm only one.
Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you?
I am not John Wayne.  There is no "S" on his chest.  We get down if the play calls for it.  But we are into business and making money.
He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set.  So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations?
We could try to run loads into these guys.  Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group.
That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time.
No.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
Chill out Sonny.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves...
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Sonny...
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
But what does your intuition tell you...?
They will kill you.  And then they will kill your wife, too.
You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again...
They lied.
You sure you heard what I said?
You sure are a pretty lady.
Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
My friend O'Daniel. That's who you need. Operates the biggest stable in town. In the whole goddam metropolitan area. A stud like you - paying! -- not that I blame you -- a dame starts crying, I cut my heart for her...
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
Rico! Rico! Rico! Is that enough?  And keep your meat hooks off my radio.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I been sick. Hold this, will ya?
Forty-second Street. Where'n hell you think it come from?
Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Just when everything's going my way, you gotta pull a stunt like this.
I been thinking. I hope we're not gonna have a lotta trouble about my name down there. Because like what's the whole point of this trip anyway?
I mean New York's one thing, but can you see this guy, imagine it, running around the goddam beach all suntan and he's going in swimming, like, and then somebody yells 'Hey, Ratso' -- how does that sound to you?
I'm wet.
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
Gin's okay.
Well, uh, I'm raring to go.
Right here, why not? I prayed in saloons, I prayed in the street, I prayed an the toilet. He don't care where, what He wants is that prayer.
You got it.
No. You got it.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Billy?
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
Sixty Lira?
Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got...
Be tough on 'em.
Aslan, there... 
Where is it?
Then I'll cut his balls off.
I know where it is.
Max - where?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
No!
You 'Merican.  You don't know.
I don't hear you bitch about the money.
Who?
Oh Yesil...  Yesil's his name but I...don't know anything... 'bout...Yesil...
Way we came.  Take the first tunnel to your right...
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Please do.  He's a lonely guy.
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Oh, man, there you go again.
Depends.  You got a memo?
I pull.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
What?
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
We?
No.
I know.  But if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
Right. Hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!
Peter-
The scent won't last...
Try not to sweat?
Ah...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
What?
What?
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
How long...?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
--my number one fan.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain.  Like a baby.  All done. 
What's it about?
No, what is it?
It has no nobility.
Well, these are slum kids, I was a slum kid, everybody talks like that.
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
You'd be amazed at what some people will believe.
I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems.  'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, I hope you like it.
Then who did?
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
I don't know.
I want my pills NOW!
--not fair?
Whenever he played Radio City, who do you think was right there in the front row?
Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years.
Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south.
Why, what are you going to do?  Kill me? Take your best shot.
But the time is now. Soon others will come.
I'm almost done.
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses.
You think he might be missing?
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
No, the typing kind.
You're still a writer.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Ahh..
What else?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one.
Uh-huh.
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Far right.
This wasn't what I had in mind, Nyah.
You've either got it or you don't.  Let your conscience be your guide?
Then feel better!..
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
He's got you on Qantas flight 2735.  It's going to be delayed.
Oh Ethan!..
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
Yes.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Right.  I guess there aren't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer.
Yep.
Left jacket pocket?
I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he's sitting on a cure without a disease.
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
They'll kill me.
His name is.....Dimitri Miediev.
This is bullshit - we dont even know what Max looks like.
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
Sleeping's better.
Did they send you...Did they send you?
Who is they, who is they?
Sure...
I just need you to be safe.
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Ethan?
This stuff is so sticky.
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
I always have, Claire..
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Dont disappoint me.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
What about Job?
Bank?
In Langley.
Jack.
Give me a break, Pops.
Ah, God, forget it.  What are we talking burnout here?
He's our guy.
We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Keep counting Claire.
That's not so good for you, my friend.
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
I'm going to bed now.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Again?
Yeah.
You did this once it didn't work out.
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Why?
Bus hit him.
Yesterday.
Stupid.
When your husband get hit by the bus?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Why you talking to me?
I'm telling you your life!
Where are you taking me?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
I've never seen a moon like that.
It makes you look like an angel.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
But he wants me to come!
Yeah. It smells like snow.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I'm here!
No.
No. I'm gonna wait.
Right.
Never is a long time.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
I don't understand.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
Pop don't like Johnny.
No more he's not.
You gotta date?
My son does not like this Johnny Cammareri. He says he is a big baby.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
But absolutely!
What happened?
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
I'm not disturbed. By you.
That woman was a student of yours?
Nerves.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
You mean the whole house?
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot.  King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
I'm not interested.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
Seek you the Bridge of Death ...
Who are the Britons?
Oh, please!
I cannot tell you.  Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
Course I have.
Had enough ... ?
You're a looney.
My liege,  I am honored.
No.  No.  No!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
Charge!
Yes.
I feel happy... I feel happy.
What is your name?
Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see!
What is the capital of Assyria?
When's your next round?
Farewell, Concorde!
They cost fifty pounds each!
Er, Well ... the thing is ... I thought your son was a lady.
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Herbert ...  We built this castle on a bloody swamp, we need all the land we can get.
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
Yes ...  make sure ...
Is that clear?
Er ... +      You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?
Ector.
You've come to rescue me?
Yes!  With a herring!  With a herring!  Cut down with a herring!
Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word ...
Bravely ran away, away.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
How about yourself?
Sixty.
Come on, man.  There's love and there's ...
She'll be worried about me.
You know nothing about her!
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
Of course.
Quite.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press.
Do you know who you address, sir?
My own.
I'm sorry?
Aye, do.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
Yes, it most certainly is!
There are important papers from --
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
I am a blank sheet.
Occasionally.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
It's nothing.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
Ah, but therein lies the paradox.  It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents.  The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that?  However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
He thought so, yes.
Those, over there, there.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
Are they worth reading?
I am told so.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
I'm breaking no promises!
Then why send me back to them?!
Because I have to! 
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
Is that not enough?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Whom?
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Unwell?
Your Majesty --
I have a letter, ma'am.
Ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
They made ARCADE.  It's still a game, right?  It thinks like a game.  Maybe it still has to play by the rules. Someone had to program it in the first place, didn't they?.
Yes I am...
Screamer.
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
I'm thinking!
Of course I am.
Sign me up.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You're broke!
Oh, Jason thought it would be a good idea for me to meet the Cowboy. Should I wear my ten gallon hat and my six shooters?
No. You're too busy being a smart aleck to be thinkin'. Now I want ya to think and quit bein' such a smart aleck. Can ya do that for me?
I understand.
You're an understandin' fella.
... What??
Wow!
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
No. I can't.
Diane?
But it said #12.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
We'll take our check.
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
I'm all right.
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
You see what I mean...
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Yeah.
Could be unrelated.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not a coke or anything?
Give me a fucking.....
I'm working on it.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
Do you have something better to talk about ?
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious.  How does it feel ?
So was I. So don't give me any shit. Your business is just as bad. At least I'm up front about it. You kill people slowly. Your corporate take overs can decimate a families livelihood over a year sometimes two. Now you know how it feels.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
There's one more person here for me to visit.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Not quite....
Why ?
Knock yourself out.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
You've got to be kidding me ! His lazy ass couldn't win the special Olympics.
Trust is earned not given away.
So ?
He already had a balance of $600,000.
For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Thank you, sir.
I don't believe Ol' Bruce is having as much fun with this as he once did. He still insists on the "guests" being of the more nefarious type.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Not you Zach.  Remember, my wife is asleep upstairs, dear.  Zach, am I gonna like what I see on this tape ? Is it the grandest of all the Park's tapes ?
What did you hear ?
Then what do you want ?
I had hoped you would say that. I have a proposal for you.....
He's got two chices.either it's the Bowling Alley from Hell or Alice in Murderland. See this ? Even Bruce knows that no one can make it out of here in one piece.
Thank you.
I meant him.
As appealing as that sounds...
Dinner at my place then ? Say, seven o'clock ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Yahoo !!!!!
I just need to sit and think for a second.
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
Maybe all that testosterone plugs his ears.
Zach from work ?
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
No.
I'm going to go ahead and go now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
No, I'm writing to the phone company because they keep charging me for calls to Caracas, Venezuela...do you know any know anybody in Caracas, Venezuela?
No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago...actually it gave me up.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Hey relax, you think I kidnapped him or something?
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
What about living in the real world pal?
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
What??
Hi honey.
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
Ummmmm, look, I...I...
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
Special effects?
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Come on in!
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
What can I do for you?
O.K. Thank you very much.
If you're selling Girl Scout cookies I'm borderline diabetic.
My mother.
But we made a business deal.
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Get married?
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
Does it work?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Owh...
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Like what?
An adventure?

I'd consider it a personal favor.
For the mini-bike fund.
No problem.
You're a good man Nicholas.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Not exactly.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Oh, sure okay.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Oh no.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Who didn't? She could play basketball like Jerry West, she danced like Sid Cherice, then she'd look at you with those big blue eyes, forget about it. I asked her out a couple of times but she always said no.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I would have tried to show her a good time. I promised her when she left that I would never forget her and I never did. Stanley Rosenfeld does not forget.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
This guy bonking you?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, come up here and we'll have a look.
They're dead?
Yes they are.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm.  Fix it.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Here?
Good.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
Perfect.
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Any more soda left?
The money?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
He's okay isn't he?
No, no.
What was my mama like?
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
Will you tell her I came by?
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
For this class?
Get away from me!
Does he love her?
After your mother died, he was sad all the time, but before that, he was pretty funny.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
Sure.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Hi.
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Never mind.
It's my mother.
Do you remember her?
Go???
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
I am running faster!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
It is not.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Okay, okay.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
I have a suggestion...
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
And you believe that.
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Impressive.
Try less appropriate.
Major.  Dish.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
You need a few dollars.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Ju...
Gold nose hair clippers.
Don't you see...
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
What, leaving school...
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
Boy, those were the days.
You keep saying that.
Have you.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
You're much more his type.
I remember when I just saw you. Skinny Winnifred. Jesus, you were skinny.
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
I know that, Star.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Don't feel that way, honey.
You have to what?
Well, my wife, Ester's down the hall. I saw Barnett leaving and I was just talking to Ester about your being here.	She loves you so much, I just had to come down and say hello. We've been following you since you were a girl. Well, I just scared you to death. I didn't mean to do that.
She's going to rest now.
Okay, I just wanted to see if I could help out at all.
Oh, sure.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
How much?
How come?
National?
I'll just be in here.
That's good,  I've never seen anything so healthy.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Suits me.
Okay... you get to sleep. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
He is just wonderful.
Maybe you can look after me a little.
Replacement party.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I don't really know what you're talking about.
No.
You got a place to stay?
You in music?
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
Do you carry door handles?
The car broke down.
Green?  Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
Bet the sheets are grey.
Fungus?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Yes, it is --
No, I don't.
He's a member of our congregation.
Linnea?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
That's not quite what I had in mind.
Wow!
I've got a gig tonight.
I can't.
Premeditated murder.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Hello.
You're real favorites of his.
Depends on what I'm studying.
Why?
What? Oh. A film.
Oh --
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
You bet.
It's not bad.
I'm John Triplette. Excuse me. I got all caught up in looking at you. You'll be fine.
Yes you are.
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
What...
Thank you, sir.
Lobotomy Bay?
She doesn't talk?
All right, Mickey.
Don't worry about it.
Tell me about the purity.
I don't give a damn if a million United States marines, all whistling the halls of Montezuma, are gonna come marchin' down this alley any second. There ain't not fuckin' way in hell I'm leaving you. And that's that!
Yes.
Unfortunately, yes.
Yes.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Scotty?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
When do you want the assembly?
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
I can't do that. Five guys.
It sure is.
You in a big hurry, boy?
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
She done moved to Detroit.
She got herself a husband now. They don' want him 'round. And I tell you, man, I got no use for him neither.
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Name's Duff.
Where was your father born?
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
You working?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
What d'you mean?
What?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Good night, Duff.
I'll see you later.
What happened, Duff?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
They won't.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
What d'you mean?
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
'Round town.
What's so hot 'round town?
I bet she's easy jam.
Like what?
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
I'm Duff.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Yeah. That's right.
Workin' a saw mill.  Here's to.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
Okay.
Sorry.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
That's right.
All right, son.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I guess not.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
What d'you know about women, Pop?
That'll make the folks very happy.
You're breaking my heart.  Got to see a man about a dog.
You hate Raoul?
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
Bathroom. But he's nowhere near it.
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
The Elders, mon...
If there's a Babylon, man, that's it. We leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
Play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. When it's over, I inject you with the antitoxin.
I was set up.  She looked at least eighteen.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.
You son of a bitch...
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
Then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. For now, that's all you need to know.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
Lady Tessier is frigid. Can't stand his touch. So she had herself cloned. The marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3Jane's his favourite.
The access code to your mainframe.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Fine, Ratz. Thanks.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
This place empty as a tomb, mon.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
Jah guides us.
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Nobody has.
How are we doing?
I'm workin' on it, Bro. I'm workin' on it.
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
You can make your move when it comes after me.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
How much time you got left?
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
I thought you already left.
Almost two days.
Too late?
It sounds like you.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
I know you have. C'mere.
Like what?
How are you at riddles, Peter?
Why do they listen to Guy?
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
 uhh, must have forgotten-
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Roger in Op/Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
No Roger from op/ed?
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
Yeah.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Jos, that's not what we're --
Okay. That's bad.
That is lingerie.
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Anita!

Five-- Six--
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Geller, this is way out of your league.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
Have you been to any parties?
Hey. There.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
Why is that impossible?
Little known fact.
Better than I...
Really?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
I don't have to say that.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
To put us back together again when we fall.
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Who are you guys?
Change is scary. Robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. I've been in it over thirty years. And in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the Elvis stamp and some gun laws. People are bored! They wanna shake things up!
<i>                      -- A bow? --        But why? --                  How ugly! -- What's in it? --                What's in it?</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
Specifically.
We've only been living here six weeks now.  I want that room unpacked by tonight.
Don't be a smart ass.
I told you I want that room unpacked.
What are you talking about?
Alright then, what is it?  Bird rabies? That cheap seed you've been buying?
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Uh-uh.  Before my time.
Traumas of a ten-year old.
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What do you mean?
Shhh.  Just concentrate.
About what?
About not finding any bogey men?
Who?  Who's doing this to you?
Sure...go ahead.
Fine.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
Did she always have nightmares?
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I gotta stay up, Max.
No, she's right.
Last time, it was me against him.  I wasn't strong enough...alone.
You never lose a gift like that.  You just forget how to use it.  How about it?  Will you try?
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
Thanks, Max.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
It'll be my last chance.  Pleese?
Say listen, Doc.  I got a new theory about all these suicides.
Right.  They seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  They're so traumatized, they'll do anything not to sleep.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Anything?
Who would know where they were hidden?
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
And what are they?
What are you talking about?
I beg your pardon?
Freddy.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
Today I'd like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, Nancy Thompson.  Let's make her feel welcome.
Oh sure.  That's just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "Goodnight honey.  Don't forget ot say your prayers. Oh, by the way, your father and I torched some maniac last night."
Now you're lying.
Oh, stop showing off.
I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do?
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Hi.
If that's all right.
Busy tomorrow?
Let's go in.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Step aside.
You've got to go.
Why?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
With a goat playing a violin.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Well...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
Stay forever.
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
Yes.
Well, obviously it's me, isn't it -- I work in the City in a job I don't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  I haven't had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
Shame!
Well, yes.  Groovy.
Blimey.  What's that?
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
Well, fire away.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Not classic, no.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
That's not fair.
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Aha!  I'd been getting a female vibe. Good.  Speak on, dear friend.
Get out, Spike.  I'm so sorry.
The one down your trousers.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
But you have no proof.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
Tell us about it...
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
What for?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
The hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. What I want is a vote on it right now!
Shoot! No wonder you don't care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
H-Hey, M-Mack.
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
God Bless America.
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
Through the ass.
Me, too...
Did to me?
Did to you and all the rest of you guys.
That!
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
I'm busting outta this place.
You can come back later!
Hear what?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Me, too! Me, too!
I don't, Doc...
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
You bet, Doc!
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
Time out!
Replacement coming in! Harding out!
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
'Kay!
You look pretty healthy to me.
I'm the next one.
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Shhhh. Time to say goodbye.
Yeah!
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Shhhh. See ya around the ball park.
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
Come an' see.
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
After you, ma'am.
Thank you, ma'am,
At this hour?
Cleanliness is a twenty-four-hour job, ma'am...
What's that?
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
No, she wasn't my sister.
I'm sorry, but without a boarding pass we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Okay, ma'am, just a moment.
Buona notte.
What for?
No.
Sure-- But, before you do that, since we're putting all our cards on the table, I have a confession to make, too.
Exactly.
No...
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Okaaaaayyyy.
But, Faith--
Hm.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
I'm at the airport.  Why?
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Boy, that looks tasty.  What is that?
I just wanted to keep an eye on you.  The guy's a total stranger, remember?
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
Uh huh.
Sure is.
Yes?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
Really...
What?
I don't know, Kate.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
No...  I can just tell.
It's a coincidence.
What about your job?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
What?
Are you sure?
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
Only what?
Nothing.
'Course he does.
Her brother.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
I meant about my idea.
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
Giovanni.
No, why?
Right.
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Went to high school with him. But...
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
No!  That's not fair.  That's not it at all.  Look, something somewhere got screwed up.  Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  I may not have the right name, but I was there.  I'm the guy.  I'm-- skywriting??
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Maybe.
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
Why Edie, I
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who?  -- who?
Which side are you with?
I'll get home all right now.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
What?
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere.  Miss Four Corners.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
But a priest...?
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
Who says?
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
That  word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
He's going to have to grow up too.
My pigeons... .
I can? Okay.  Okay...
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
I think you could have.
Such as what?
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and  Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys 
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You was a Golden Warrior.
Easy. Easy, boy.
First things first.
I'll see you on the roof.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Now just a minute, I
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap connivinggood-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Look who says bum!
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Be careful, oh please be careful.  We'll never get out of here alive, I know it.  I just feel it.
A situation easily remedied.
A symbol, Master.
Her dance has pleased me.
Now, I will talk...to The Wolf Man...and The Mummy.
At your discretion...But first, I desire more entertainment.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
I understand, Master
Well then let us proceed.
What do you suppose for?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Without the snake, of course.
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Yes, around here.  I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here.  Manuel the Mayishan was my name.
Listen, I'm the one help Jack escape from prison.  He tole me, I can't find him to see you.  So why don't you open this fucking door.  Okay?  So we can speak.
His idea?  Gimme a break.  Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head.  Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Sure looks that way.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
How long were you with the girl?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
You might not have a choice.
I don't know.
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What?  Is that what you're calling me about?
Yeah, sure, Karen.  You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're gonna use a ram?
Wait.  You not Adele?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
Warm?  Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns.  No, I ain't talking any business in here.  To me this is holy ground, man.  You understand?  I got to be someplace anyway.  Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
The fuck you talking about?
Someone down here?
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
You're right.  So why take a chance--
If I could have a little more room.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
Why, are you famous?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Sure.
Is that right?
Yeah...
I called your room from downstairs.
He killed a police officer.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I don't think we should get into that.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
We'll go to my bank.  I'll make a withdrawal.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
Hejira.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
Glenn, take the exit.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
Gimme another hint.
It's Richard Ripley.
What?
We went out there, full SWAT, two choppers, the whole bit, but Linares started shooting anyway.  We put him down, but somehow Chirino got away.
Thanks.
You a lawyer?
He said he stayed here last November.
Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
What're you doing at Glades?
No, he looks a lot...
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
So?
I told you, he isn't here.
That's how you score now?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Where you been hiding, Dick?
If Evelyn's here, the rest are here!
Ooo, she's thinking of her date!  Come on, you've been dating a pilot.  We want to know what we can expect.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Sir?
Hale-what?
Sir, I --
Too late for apologies, Walker.
Mai-tai's.  I got this to tell ya, about mai-tai's.
Yeah, but he was wearing shoes!
They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit...
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Good shooting, Rafe!
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
Never, Sir.  I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit.  And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks.  To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Explain what?
You too, 'Mam.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
There've been some complications, Sir. The Chinese didn't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set.  And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway.
Crank her!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
Peggy Sue!
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eightysix.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
What am I going to do with you?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
What?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
Of course.
It opens, too. Look inside.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Oh, God, Dion.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Of course.
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Coffee and a donut.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more JellO for me, Mom.'
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot.  What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I hate chickens.
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
That would be impossible.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Evelyn, take her to her room!
The hat business is in trouble.
Yes.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
What about?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What do you mean?
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
But accidents can happen.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
It really wasn't that difficult.
I	know what a burrito is.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
You look pretty good for a corpse.
You're giving me the creeps.
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Come on. You can't be serious.
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?
Like what?
Exactly! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
There are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
--Drew, he's your dog. Are you listening to this?
How'd you know that?
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
He's probably going up to the Pet Sematary. Kids've been going out there on Halloween night for years.
Sure.
Hey, I'm so sorry I'm not the stud that you are.
Stepdad. Gus is my stepdad.
You have to bury your own. That's the way the Indians did it. It's like a rule...
You know everything, don't you?
What's wrong with your face?
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Yeah. Thanks, guys.
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
I'm not ready to die.
Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
Correct. I'm seeking representation.
My lover and I.
Correct. I don't.
Let's find you a drink.
Sure. It's fine.
You're right.
For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
You're ready, don't worry.
He was... the kind of person I thought I wanted to be.
It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I'm an excellent lawyer.
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Yes. On my torso.
A good start.
Not unnecessary ones.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Absolutely.
Hi, Mom. It's me.
Thanks, Mom... Dad?
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
People who want to bend the rules...
Get a life.
And the way they work out, pumping up, so they can be macho and faggot at the same time... I can't <u>stand</u> that shit. Now I'm being totally honest with you.
Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake!
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Night, honey.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
On behalf of the defendants?
Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda, I've got a figure over here, of one million, five. I...
Dr. J.!
Charles...
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
<u>What</u>?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
We can't make it.
Carolyn Fry. I'd shake hands, but...
Tell me it's not a mirage.
So why isn't it all bloody?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
'Sokay, 'sokay. I killed it.
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
Quiet, please. Everyone.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
The best. But we won't need them.
You still don't believe me, do you?
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
Good luck then.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
How can scientific truth be heresy? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink, and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren't they cleaned up before they're brought here?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.
Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question.  This hearing is adjourned.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
He's trying to form words.
Sorry...  I was thinking of Stewart. What d'you suppose happened?
Fine. Just let her out.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Stop right there. Bring me that paper.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
I take it you don't believe the prosecutor's charge -- that I'm a monster created by Dr. Zira.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
Of course.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
A hearing.
You're going back to the Forbidden Zone?
Taylor, please --
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
What?
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
Jes' fine man, jes fine! Ain't never felt better! Both of us two timers man, we're out.  See you at the hospital man, we gonna get high-high yessir... 
What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
She was a crossbreed, Chinese and Polish.
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
Yeah, those are the guys that live. I really don't think Death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, I think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
Sounds like it.
Bah, you're a child, Lerner. Rhah don't waste time on you.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
Yes?
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
Okay. You win.
I'm afraid there's nothing more tonight, Miss. Unless you charter a plane.
I'm carrying quite a large sum in Travelers checks. How much of a deposit would you like?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
Much too late.
There's one less tonight.
Sure... but somebody always does..
No thanks.
He could hardly help suspecting you.
Let's not pretend Mitchell meant anything to either of us.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
Couldn't be.
Us?
Nothing matters.
From you, I like it.
They'll look for you.
I can still see the shoreline. The moon is rising.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
I'm sorry.
I've never been to Florida.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
We try to be decent.
You wouldn't even try  There must be some copper in you, or you wouldn't be an inspector.
He looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
Very ridiculous.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
Time's up.  I'm off the case. 
To do what?
What will they do to you?
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
You asked for it.
Charlie's suits me fine. I don't scare.
That comedian?
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
Round of golf Saturday?
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Mitchell was killed down here.  How could Clarendon get in to do it?  Or Margo for that matter.
Wait a minute.  I'll go with you.
Or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "Miss Mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  They always have another.
And now that he's safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
If you'd seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Would you?
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
How important would it have to be? It's only murder, Inspector.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
We don't need him.
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
Open it and count it.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
They'll probably believe you.  But they'll want to know what you were fighting about.  Why Mitchell had a gun.  You'll tell them a simple story.  They'll pretend it sounds all right to them.  Now you're headquarters.  How does it sound to you?
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Positive?
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
And if you didn't believe me?
Mayfield?  She fit into this?
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
"Superintendent J. McKechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Replying your inquiry Elizabeth Kinsolving.  Subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, Lee Kinsolving, January this year. Guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  Prisoner discharged, Whereabouts now unknown. Fingerprint classification"--  And exact correspondence, Killaine.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
How long have you had it?
You already have the checks, darling.
Right.
It's kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
History books are first onto the bonfires.
We'll see you next week, and if--
I will, thanks.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
This is Jill, Carol, Betty, Mandy, Louise, Pete over there, and I'm Carmen.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
How nice.
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
Who?
Well, you know...
Too late.  Just my luck.
That'll be fun
Are you up to something?
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
I'm waiting for your mother.
I'm not here.
That's good.
Or a beer.  I've got some in.
Yes.
You'd look naked without one.
It's true!  I was here last year doing a piece, remember?  I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs.  They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet.  They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television?  You're just a young thing.'  They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying  'Oo, can I?'
Two years of surgery.  I missed my window.  Limped through law school instead.
Not yet.
The one you decked is Bunker Wiess. The big one is his brother, Warchild.  The other two always hang.  They think they're some kinda death squad around here.
They're punks.  Nazis.  Their brains are wired wrong.  They hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. They just want to get radical.  It's mindless aggression.  They'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
'One shot stopping'... good, very good.  I like you, Johnny.  I like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  I respect that. It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. Here, hold it.  Check out the weight.
I'll take that as a yes.
Sure you can!  You may even like it... it's a killer rush.  You'll see.  Hey, don't I show you things, Johnny U?
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  Do it!  Come on, you want to do it.  You're gonna die, Johnny.  Five more seconds.  Four...
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
The shit they pull, huh?
Welcome to Sea World, kid.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Guy's the Toxic Avenger.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Okay, Dad.
Got it.
Awright.  Get into position.  I'm rolling.
I'm serious.
This gonna take long?
Sure.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Come on.  At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
Probably another rebel patrol. They operate in here all the time.
Because I told you, you're the best. I knew you could do it but I couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
No more games.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Philip!  We'll need shoes!
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
Hope to be?
I talked to some developers about the land.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
It is <u>not</u> your company.  It's a public company.  And I <u>am</u> going to acquire it.  Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly Hills?
It pays.
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Neither do I.  A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
Why?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Do you plan everything?
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
Just a romantic, that's you.
What?  Why?
Don't drown.
Of course.  How much?
Done.
Holy shit.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
This isn't a date.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Television?
Was someone rude to you?
Good.
Come with me?
Not much to tell.  I went to public school.  Went to university on scholarship.  Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it.  My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after.  I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
He died a long time ago.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Vivian...
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Right.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
I'll see him alone.  Everyone knows you're my muscle.  We'll make it social.  Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner.  Tonight if you can arrange it.
I'll bring it back.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there.  We can bleed'm dry.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
Why?
Give me twenty minutes.
Let him answer.
Yes.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Why'd he want you?
In Beverly Hills?
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Yeah, well, I check out today.
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
I just might do that.
I suggest a deal. You write four copies of a letter. I'll send my four fastest ships. One in each direction. The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year. We'll run up the white flag and deliver your message. If Westley wants you, bless you both. If not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. Are we agreed?
You're a silly girl.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
He knows I do not love him.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
And what am I?
As you wish.
Of course you will.
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
What?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
I'll be right back.
Yeah. It's really good.
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.  So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
My spy network has heard no such news.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
The loser ran off alone.  The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder!
Tyrone, you know how much I love watching you work. But, I've got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, My wife to murder, and Guilder to frame for it. I'm swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- anything you want --
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Sixty-five.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
Then why are you smiling?
I ought to be after twenty years.
Tell me.
I must know.
Get used to disappointment.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
Yes.
Hmm.
You only think I guessed wrong --  -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
An hour.
Think it'll work?
Maybe he won't.
Let's hear him.  What have we got to lose?  What's your name?
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"Honeymoon,
I'll wait in the hall ...
Twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you're using up your time.
Where?  What?
According to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  There's two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
No, Bloom, you don't understand. This is fate, this is destiny. There's no avoiding it.
You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea.
Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ...
What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island?
Maybe you're happy.
Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
To failure!
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
With whom?
Never mind.  Listen.  Every night people are laughing at your beloved Fuhrer.  Why?
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
Here I come, ready or not.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
What do you do best?
Hey, baby, that's where they put me, Sing-Sing.  How'd you know that, you been up?
We can't... we keep our money there!
I told them we invaded England.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
Tell me all about her.
Very early. Dawn.
No.
How do you know she didn't make a call?
How did she pay you?
Why should she? I'm sorry, I have work to do, Mr... if you don't mind...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I live there. Alone.
I'm not a fool! And I'm not capable of being fooled! Not even by women!
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Can I trade in my car and take another?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I'll be perfectly honest with you, Ma'am. It's not that I don't trust you, but...
Okay. If you'll come along...
Like what?
What difference does that...
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Just what he told your detective.
Where?
Don't you know?
A good reason, I suppose.
Is Mary... in trouble?
Yes.
Not that kind...  You men and your egos.
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
I ought to call the police right now!
No.
You want me to stay here?
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
It's been three.
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
Just wait here?
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
Alive.
She always tries to be proper.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
I'm glad we didn't.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
I could stand something regular.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
I have?
Thank you. Again.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
You go out... with friends?
Only my share.
You should... mind it.
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
Sometimes when she talks that way to me I'd like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  Or at least, defy her.  But I couldn't. She's ill.
It's too late for me. And besides... who'd look after her? She'd be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. When you love someone, you don't do that to them, even if you hate them. Oh, I don't hate her.  I hate... what she's become. I hate... the illness.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I'd like to, but...
Please... I'd like to go...
Now what?
Why?
Have you two had breakfast?
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
You must've seen an illusion, Sam. Now, I know you're not the seeing- illusion type... But no woman was illusion there and I don't believe in ghosts, so there it is!
Did I?
What--special autopsy?
Never mind your theories. Was she ever conscious?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
That sounds to me very remarkable.
Sure, got thousand cats, too. Look at 'em-- Points to cages of cats.
So--that's it. Buckley took the body.
He isn't here.
I'm going to call the police.
How? What can I do?
It sounds all right, except for the fact that she's crazy. It seems to me she has the right idea--.
The wound is bleeding!
I'm losing my blood!
Yes, the child ...
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
I've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but I've never hit one with dough. This love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
Thank you.
I'd love to, at any time.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
I'd love to.
I'm not kidding. Joan Gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and I saw the most horrible thing down there.
You mean he was colored?
That you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. There's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. You're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
You give me a pain!
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
I used to be married to one.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
I'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! I'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
No, sir. About three months ago.
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Better cut that out.  That's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  What's wrong?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
Stolen! What are you trying to do to me? ... You're working with the police! ... You're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! You're trying ...
Who'd steal her body?
It doesn't usually take that long, but I'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when I met you.
Even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- I have never seen anything more exquisite.
I regret I can't spend the time I'd like with your exhibition, but I'm going to worry the life out of you when I come back. 
Something important has got to come of it! Do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
You've got to permit it! Whose fault is it that no one comes here? The museum at Walston Lane does well enough, and why? They've got Jack the Ripper, Burke and Hare, the Mad Butcher, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and things people pay to see.
And he isn't struck dead! This man, he lives! It would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic.  They connect in unimaginable ways.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
Sure. Let me take your suitcase.
Nobody.
You were pretty bad, huh?
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
But I'm curious, Rose.
Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport.
But I don't know who they are.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
But how would you find him?
Daddy, what's the matter?
She's got somebody in there, Brother! His shoes are on the back porch -- there they were, naked and smiling at me!  Rose, open this door immediately!
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
She's getting herself up to go out.
Yeah.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
You shouldn't watch such things, Doll.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
Then why does she act so dumb?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Not for long, boy. I've outstayed my welcome already.
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
I have of course observed the girl in treating her.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
You're not having lunch?
Yes, darlin', time will tell.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I don't intend to mock you, dear. I respect your philosophy. It's beyond my comprehension, but I respect it.
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
What did you forget?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
Fine.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Yes, sir.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
Yes, sir.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
It'll get better now.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
Well... what can I do?  You've created a dilemma...  And, look at the that. Time's running out.  I wonder... how can I impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
Fair enough.
What... ?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
I need the "when" and the "where."
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
We'll share.
No you can't.
We should slow down.
Feeling great.
Bullshit.
No, we're stealing.
Oh.  Well.   I think it's pretty common knowledge that in the Battle of Little Big Horn, Custer was drunk off his ass.
There probably is.
Where have you been?
You mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? You mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest Joe?
You can't be serious.
Well, shake a leg.  Get these files downstairs...  And, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
Till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. And, after that, I'll decide if you keep your shield.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Shit.  You're right.
No you're not.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
That's not true.
Gimmie a minute.
Sounds good.
Your wish is my command.
You mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
You cannot escape your destiny.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.
That's all any of us can see.
Lower it!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Proper?!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
What do you remember?
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
Never-r-r!
Your father he is.
Certainly not!
On my mother's grave.
It's just a..a party Janet.
Oh don't be so shy.
So come up to the Lab.
Oh my, my,
Cards for sorrow, Cards for pain.
You're too kind.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
I sold them to you.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time.  Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
D'you really wanna call?
It's fine.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
What?
Don't tease me.
Sharp -- Real nice.
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
...Like you?
You didn't!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
...It's very American.
...This man.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
This a con?
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Charge it.
The Champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- Another left to right combination. I feel sorry for --
What's happenin' here?
That's it, I'm broke.
Paulie's sister.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Not spar, I'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting Creed for the championship.
Stuff it, man!
I like yella teeth.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Why?
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
I won't.
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Dipper needed it.
Did ya win?
Yeah, Kayo.
...I said that before.
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Real good.
Damn! How's it look?
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
...Adrian ain't sharp.
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe ya better forget it.
I got whiskey here.
...No.
Whatta you think?
The story -- what's happenin'?
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
Whatta these guys want?
Do you feel you have a chance?
Maybe --
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Wish I could say the same.  What're you doin' here, Betty?
A tweeting bird?
No kiddin'?  Bought the Red Cars, huh?
I don't wanna think.  I wanna drink.
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Why would he contact me?  I just took some lousy pictures.
Oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>Toon</u>town.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
What the hell's a freeway?
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
Where is he?
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
He made me laugh.
So what?  He's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
That was the idea.
Well, everybody needs a hobby.
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Yeah, that's better.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
My brother.  Get inside.
We can't do anything till it's dark.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Get away from there.
Forget it.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
The what?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
[Within] Juliet!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Mercutio! Thou art consortest with Romeo?
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
You know it is.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
That's why you were riding with him.
Budweiser?  You talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention Budweiser in the same sentence?  That's not beer!  Christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.
Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
Is that right?
I'm a patriate.
Where do you get off saying word one? All the time pretending to be one of us, it's the same thing we were doing, Seamus and myself.  And here you are so high and mighty, like you're so different from the rest of us.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
We'll double your price.
You first, Edvard.
He's a cop, Vincent, he's French and he's a cop and you better shoot him in the fucking head right now!
In here...
You've told me a lot of things, boyo...
But you hate each other!
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
That's it.
Not exactly.
Well, Vincent's American friend, shall we see what we can do for you?
Yeah.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
Things.  This is my country, you know.
What's the difference?
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
And what job is that?
I'm going with you.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
Thorough man.
It's my job.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
Because I owe you.  Look at that...
You think?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
Would you stop with that...
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
Finish it!
I guess that's for the best.
Doing well.  This is?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I can't get enough of it.
Seven thousand...
Cash and what?
We'll figure something out.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
I...I can't do that.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
I've got a better idea.  All we have to do is straighten out Jesse.
Not bad enough to kill him.
There it is...now what about the others?
You killed him...
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
Yes I DO!  It never woulda stopped, you know that.  Jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
He found us, he shot her...he killed her...
Why don't you get to the point.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
You mean that guy was an agent?
It's odd.  I don't know how Denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
I gotta take some money out, that's what for.
He's irresponsible.
Has he?
Nothing.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Nothing happened?
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
No I don't.  You sure you havent seen her?
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
A lot of men come in here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and Im a busy man.
Why?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
I'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
I don't know...
What?
Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
It certainly is...
You'd do this to me!
I was on a roll!  Im a little overextended now.
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
We're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  What's your take on these local boys?  Are they providing any answers?
No, sir.
Everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  Did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? Do I look like Chicken George to you?
I'd like to see you try.
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now.
I said get on your feet!
You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house.
Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu.
No.
Well, hurry up.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
All the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  Tan resigned and went over to the Triads openly.
You said --
Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man.
No.  It was my singing.
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
I don't want to hear this.
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What is it?
See you in the next world.
Yes.  We have heaven.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
Follow me my Asian brother.
It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room.
I guess so.  Thank you, Carter.
It's okay, I got lots more.
New York City?
Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Just trying to make it look real.
Look over there.  That's the eye in the sky room.
Why don't you go get them?
I still have my lunch money from third grade.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee.
In used currency.  Nothing bigger than a fifty.
I got a call from the F.B.I.  The daughter of the Chinese Ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. You're it.
He was just doing his job.
Yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in L.A. after what?  Six hours?
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yes, I know this song.
I got to stop that dancing in the street till all hours.
Where'd you get it?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
Alright, Johnson, thank you.  So...what are you wearing?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
And your buddy, Mr. Lee, is on his way back to China.  Now, get out. Before I file obstruction of justice charges against you.
Shut up!
Or somethin'.
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
What are you talking about?
Even if you deny the FBI is there, I will assume you are lying.
Can I speak with her?
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Han?
Carter, can I have a moment?
I was trying to find the right time.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
Of course.
We'll rub.
Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
And end up in the papers?  I've been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got you canned.
Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we know.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven-fifty.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
Highly suspect.
You don't know.
You know, there's no...
No.  You take it.
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him.  Keep an eye on him.
You humiliated me!
I already explained about that.
That's called changing your mind.
No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma.
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Yes.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
I changed it.  See you later, Mr. Travis.  That guy has a problem... Maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
Yeah.
Nope.
But it's on the water.
Am I what they had in mind?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Happy New Year.
Go to the Symphony --
I don't think so.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
I know.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
I know. 
Come on, Jonah --
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
Shhhh --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I'd rather die than eat on an airplane.  I'm telling them you're twelve so you can fly unaccompanied and they won't make you be carried around by a stewardess and everything.
It's a spice rack.
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Somewhere in the middle.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school.  I am not going to think about it.  Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Will she scratch up your back?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I don't know.
It's only ten o'clock.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
Who is Annie?
You said we could go to New York.
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Well...
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Absolutely.  When I come back, maybe the two of us should spend some time together, on our own.  What do you think?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Yeah.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
So much the better.
They are singing for me.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
No.
She's the organizer's, wife. She's got to be there.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Alone?
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
Papa! We seen 'em! Two scabs! Over there!
Are you Australian?
Good. I fucking hate Australians.
Shhh.
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
I ain't a idiot, asshole.
Why not?
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
You can still work.
He knows where I work.
You always been this stubborn?
I been that way ever since.
I can't tell you.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
These guys are smart. I knew they wouldn't hit a deal unless they knew all the players. I needed a big buyer.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
Guess it's our turn.
Twelve
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Because I don't want to see you end up like Kujo and those other losers.  I thought that maybe if you knew that I didn't use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
Good for you Jimmy.
Anything for a dear friend.
Pull your pants down.
Just some buddies.
The money? The drugs? Keeping yourself out of jail? I know the drill.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
Soon. I promise.  We'll get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  In the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
We got the 411 on your good old boy.
Pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
It speaks!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
The Mexicali Boys
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Funny, I don't feel lucky.
Again, I thank you.
Really?
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
But that's okay, Liz, you're the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I'm just an unemployed musician.  You have every right.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
I just want to be straight on the details.  Can I taste it?
Resistance?
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
Yep, you step on a rusty nail, get lockjaw, never say another word as long as you live.
Cap'n...?
Hell, no!
Like hell, you did.
Seems to me, Cap'n, this mission is a serious misallocation of valuable military resources.  Miller Go on.
Say what, Cap'n?
Senator's son?
It was nothing.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
I've been humming it.
That only leaves three.
Plenty.
You don't count.
Would they notice and eighty-eight?
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Yep, hell of a mission.
PUSH!
Maybe.
Is it getting worse?
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Oh, yeah?
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
I'll do my best.
You're welcome, John.
Yes, sir.
Reiben, how the hell do you know so much about lingerie?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
There's to be a bright side, look for it.
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'm sorry, sir, I apologize.  But if you weren't a captain, or if I were a major, what would you say?
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
Is silent.  Motionless.  He gently closes Wade's eyes.  His hand quivers slightly as he unclips one of Wades dogtags.  He fumbles and drops it. Sarge notices.
Well, sir, consider the possibilities. A:  Ryan is alive.  We have to take him back to the beach.  Knowing you, you don't let him carry my gear, even though he really should, and we all get killed, trying to keep him alive.
HERE THEY COME!
OPENS UP with the MACHINE GUN.
Here they come.
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
More tanks...  Ryan Lot's of them The fear on their faces turns to resignation.  They know that they are dead men.  They settle into their positions, and prepare to fire and die.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
That's right.
Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Good for her.
Hey, sis.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
What's a scam?
Lloyd, give it up.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I already did.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
Confirm this with my office and my client.
Alright.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Ha!  Go back!  What a great line!
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Dad.
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Well listen to me.  Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh?  What are you going to talk about?  What do you have in common?  You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
But I found the money.
You think you know what this money is?
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.  I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
Hmmm....
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
That's cool then.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Come on.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yeah.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
Right.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
Why didn't you tell me?
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Yeah.
Yeah, uh-huh.
We decided...
Yeah you do.
No I didn't.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
What, I'm sorry I said that.  Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
Okay.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Jim Court... no, this is her father.  I'll take...
I know.
I know
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd!  I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this.  I don't deserve to have you as my go-between.  And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
Hey.
How you doin', brother?
You know Diane Court?
Wow, man.  Well.  Listen man, I need you to be the keymaster.
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I was just going to kind of move around.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Yeah, alright.
Nothing's changed.  Then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
In Breslau.
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
I pay you too much.
What's going on?
I got a shipment of Hungarians coming in, I got to make room for them.  It's always something.
Look -
You asked for shoe polish.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
This is not my problem.
Yeah.
I mean where have you been? Nobody's seen you around for a while.
The war could end.
I think it's too late.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
Would it do any good?
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Find me every variation of Himbry and what was the other name...
I heard a noise.
Ted? Where are you? Are you drinking? Hold on.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
No, it's me.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Not until youre dead.
You've done nothing but get rich off of me. How many books have you sold, Gale? You think I don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Home--where he lives.
Look, I know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm not interested in the scoop anymore. Excuse me.
You freakin?
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the room with his dim-witted Barney Fifish presence." I think you've explained yourself.
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I think you're all an act.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
I know that.
Not good.
Meaning?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
No, wait here.
It's what you want from me.
You're getting obvious.
Too bad.
Thanks, Joel.
If we hurry, we can still catch the Sandra Bullock movie.
You are so not funny.
He's after me.
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
I'll relay it. You sure you don't wanna go home?
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Heh heh I bet they are babe. I bet they are. Look, my battery's dying . . .
Who is this?
Who is this?
Now let's see you act your way out of this one.
Please, call me Gale.
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
I'm a homicide detective, remember?  When you see what I see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. I think you know about that.
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Yeah. A real tragedy.
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
They've got her!
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
What's wrong with just being Gale Weathers? I liked her!
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
What?
Do you want us to come with you?
Honestly, my life.
Sure.
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
Oh shit it's my cell!
I am Gale Weathers!
That's funny.
Bitch.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
They're the ones who approved it.
Who?
Just because you knew her?
Yeah.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Sarah, it's Roman, I'm sorry I'm running late, I'm still on the 405, I'm about 10 minutes away.
But you know my favorite name?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
The final act? Well let's play asshole!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Sorry.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
So you gonna try and make up with Sid?
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here.
I'll only stay a sec.
What are you doing here?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
It's been a year since she died.
What?
I called my dad.
I'm alright. Gotta... get... help.
Are you alone in the house?
What number are you trying to reach?
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Uh-huh.
Really? What?
Just some scary movie.
You have to have a favorite.
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND?
They'd never make it in time.
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
Why are you doing this?
...please...
No...
Then answer the question. Same category.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Answer the question and I will.
There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly -- you live.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
Deputy... good evening.
What brings you out to these parts?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
I don't know. I guess.
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Yeah.
Not yet.
How is everything?
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
How is she?
Yes, sir.
Call the police.
Kenny. Camera. Now.
I owe you shit.
During the trial, you did all those stories about me. You called me a liar.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Your front porch.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Can you knock?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
What?
He came to make up.
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
Hey, Stu? Didn't you use to date Casey?
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Whatever. Just hurry.
No, nothing's like it used to be.
Deal.
Where you guys been? We had to start without you.
I'm in.
One is gluttony.
Yeah.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
Okay...
It's not too far away now.
Why?
Her pretty head.
You'll see.
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
Really?  Just biding your time, then? Toying with me.  Is that it?  Letting five people die until you finally felt like going out and hauling me in?
Sit back.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
This is a premeditated puzzle, and it's only the beginning.
How's that?
I just have to say, I can't respect any man who's never seen "Green Acres."
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Who the hell knows?  There's plenty of freaks out there doing dirty deeds they don't want to do.  You know... little voices tell them bad things.
The fingerprints.
Yes.  They were there... so, it must be.
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
Sorry about that... I just...
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
Saint Thomas Aquinas.  He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
Think about how we got here!
No point in arguing anymore...
We had him.
Then, he must write about these murders.
You do your job...
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
Big surprise.
Well... what the fuck, man?
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
Well, I have to tell you...  I think I've fallen in love with you.
There's no time to discuss it!
I can't do this now... please.
Any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. Just ask your husband.
I don't sleep very well.
Naw...a human man rides a horse till it dies...then he goes on afoot...A Comanche comes along...gets that horse up...and rides it twenty more miles...Then he eats it.
It was, I tell you!
This 'un come a long way 'fore he died.
You're right sure you want to <U>jump</U> 'em, Ethan?
Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
Ay-eh...Made out I was crazy...  Ate dirt...chewed grass...I fooled 'em, Ethan!...an' I got away...
And maybe you lie...
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Well, fust off...
An Injun will chase a thing til he thinks he's chased it enough...Then he quits...Same when he runs...Seems he never learns there's such a thing as a critter that might just keep comin' on...So we'll find them in the end, I promise you that...We'll find them just as sure as the turning of the earth.
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
What?
Look?
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
We won't be here...Come on!
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
I got to fetch her home...
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone.  But don't forget...
It still worked in town.
Making our very own solstice fire.
Cherry-red Tears.
Hi, darling.
Okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "There is something negative about the place..."  What the hell are you trying to say?  Come on!  Spit it out!
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
I don't know all about what happened back then.  But it always stood between me and my husband.
Excuse us.  But do stop by for a visit sometime!  You are welcome anytime.
Well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
Oh
And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.
You have the last act?
Wait!  Will you desist!
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
You're a liar.
Ned is wrong for it.
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?
Yes, I saw it.
Take his feet out. Where will you get
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Of course not!
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business.  The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
I don't know. It's a mystery.
Nobody knew!
She is always Aphrodite.
Who wrote that?
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
To the Palace at Whitehall.
What? Who?
Romeo.
Go on.
Wonderful, wonderful.
The daughter of his enemy.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
As a nurse.
Burbage has my keeping but you have my heart.
I have to get back.
If they find you here they will kill you.
You can bring them with a word.
I am.
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
Even your play.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. I must
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
You lie.
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
Orsinogood name
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
I . . .
Does she say so?
Your aunt?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Have you seen him?
Come on, David.
No.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
I'm just telling you I can't cut him up.
I just thought we should discuss it.
Now.
You're sure? There's lots more.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
I've never seen any of these men before.
And you like it?
Cameron?
Really?
What I am.
-- which is a hack.
I think you're lying.
You see, they don't really know me.
He's got a car?
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
All right. No problem.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Old newspaper proverb says dead human being is living story. Be rational, please, and failing that be quiet.
I don't want to. It's different.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
What are you doing here?
And the money?
I'll wait there.
We were just sorting things out.
The perfect couple, I should say.
Don't you ever stop?
What?
Yeah.
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
You're sure of that.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Here?.
And he's a patient of yours?
I mean, that's what it's like.
Then what's the problem?
What're you talking about, George?
Maybe... why do you ask?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
What do you expect me to do about it?
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
Yeah, I think so.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
What?
What kind of treatment?
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
I never get my hair done.
Then what do you think?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Great.
I went to school with her husband.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I don't know. Probably not.
You would?
Yeah... I mean great.
What's wrong?
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
-- this guy with Jill.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
-- yes, you --
So I'm saying it...
I don't know... Jackie?
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
I have to see you.
Okay!
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
I am?
What!
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
Okay.
Egypt.
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I want your feelings about it.
-- go ahead.
Where did this come from?
What do you wanna know for?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
No?
I'm better than the guy I work for.
Okay.
Oh, hey...
See she doesn't drink too much.
Layered?
What do they look like?...
Oh Jesus Christ.
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Who?
Oh yeah...
I'll call you back...
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Because I don't want one.
I'll call you.
-- Yeah, honey...
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
Is he an enemy?
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Sort of.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
Good for you.
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
No, it's not that...
Are you married?
Yes?
Come here for a minute, first.
Good.  I want you to have a good time.
Good.  I want you to like it here. I wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
Yes, Dad.
French Fries and Ketchup.
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
What about Room 237?
Okay, Mom.
Yeah.
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Because he hides.
Where does he go?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Sure.
Delbert Grady.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Hallo.  My name's Dick Halloran. I'm the Head Chef up at the Overlook Hotel.
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
God, I've never seen anything like this before.  Are all of these Indian designs authentic?
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Fine.  Why don't you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
I can't really remember.
Stay away...!
Wendy give me the bat.
Give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Well, that's very good time, very good.  Please sit down a minute.
can of itself be a problem.
shut in together over long periods of time.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
Thank you, Susie.
How do you do?
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
It was Brady's idea, Jane. Honest to God. Please take the money. I want to make up.
Stop it!
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
For getting a divorce?
Piss on him. Piss on all the Red Sox.
Huh?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Sure.
Save this one for last.
I told you!
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
-and Babcock, I remember. Now go on!
I will- be good, kids.
Oh?
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
What about crack?  You a user?
I said I was a nun, not an asshole.
Were you tempted?
We were talking about the wild thing. Teen promiscuity.
Well... because it's in the Bible. "Thou shalt not..."  Thou shalt not.
With love.
You did what?
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Why?
Sure is!  Come on in, and sing a spell.
The goods.  The sound.  The sale.  Let's rearrange a few things.  Mary Patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  Get over here.  Mary Robert --with the sopranos.
This is so exhilarating!  All week long, I can't wait till Sunday, when we sing.
Progressive convents.  Vanity.  It sounds awful.  It sounds just like this place.
Um, I don't really know this one...
Amateurs 2
Babies
I... I...
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
She won't?  Why not?
Mary Clarence!  You're so... different from the other sisters.  Sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
Experience!
Now stop that.  You didn't shoot at me. You were only trying to help, to give me experience.  I tried to explain that to Reverend Mother, but -- I don't know if she understood.
Enough joking.
That's my real name!  Currently I'm a singer.  Sort of.
Your cigarette -- out.
What's a concubine?
Before we do, you might like to freshen up.  And you'll certainly want to change
A what?
No food?
Your cell is more than adequate.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
Exactly.  People like going to theaters and casinos.  But they think church is for Grandma -- we could change that. Pack the joint.
I must go where I can be of use.
I'm a Christian.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
I used to buy.you,..stuff.  On your birthday .  When we were seeing each other.
Oh, yeah? Well, how do you think I felt? You were singing in bowling alleys back then.  I told people you were a hooker!
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Get a stenographer.
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You're gonna be singing for St. Peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
You know so much.  They've got Christy, and we've got to find her.  Get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  Fax it to every contact we got.
So, take it off.
Which one!
Yeah, right -- when I see it.
Oh, she's doing just fine, Reverend Mother -
That was exciting!
But how do we get there?
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
Many have.
How did you hear this?
I hit him square.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
... Brom Bones...
Does that look like an animal hanging?
They need guidance.
Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here.
A fine idea.
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
Why this tree?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Nothing.  To hell with this place and all the people here.
There is no such thing as magic.
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
It was you there?
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
What would you have me believe?
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
No.  Get to the crest of the roof and be ready to jump.
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
Let her go!
Yes... yes.  I think I will...
Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me?
You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father.
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
I can't remember.
I like them french-fried potaters.
Yeah, me too.
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.
That boy wants me to.
He's a regular whiz at it. That's all he did when he was a kid.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
He does make some funny noises.
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
What do you want, hun?
That ain't none of your damn bidness. Besides that's the way friends do one another. Fuck it, I'm gonna go call 'em. Honey, find my guitar, I think it's out there in the garage with that loony tune.
I know Albert. We're friends.
Childers.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Ain't got nowhere to set 'em down.
They let you out?
Me and the Burnett twins and some boys plays down at the junior high practice field all the time. If you ever want to come by and play. We ain't no good either. Well, I'll see you later.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
What do you mean?
Why?
Yes sir. Right then it was.
A little ol' boy.
Make believin' always made me feel good too from time to time.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
I'm glad of it you was borned.  I reckon I ain't gonna be there in the garage no more.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Reckon what kind of a feelin'?
Okay.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
They turned me aloose from the nervous hospital. Said I was well.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I'm pretty handy I reckon on lawn mowers and whatnot.
I reckon.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
Well, I guess we better hit the road.
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
My history.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
Ma'am?
Not really to speak of.
Quite a spell, I reckon.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
I ain't a-stayin'. I need to ast you fer a favor.
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
I know.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
The other thing is I told your boss on the phone to send a man. Karl won't talk to women.
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
An invitation?
I confess.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
What's that, Sol?
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Hey, man. Good to see you. What'll it be today?
Not Elizabeth the Second, Elizabeth the First.  Did you ever hear of Sir Walter Raleigh?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
Taking pictures?  It's a long story. I'd need two or three drinks to get through that one.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
They're all the same, but each one is different from every other one. You've got your bright mornings and your dark mornings. You've got your summer light and your autumn light. You've got your weekdays and your weekends. You've got your people in overcoats and galoshes, and you've got your people in shorts and T-shirts. Sometimes the same people, sometimes different ones. And sometimes the different ones become the same, and the same ones disappear. The earth revolves around the sun, and every day the light from the sun hits the earth at a different angle.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Cops? You mean they nabbed those cruds?
Or didn't.  There's no way of knowing, is there?
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
I'm all ears.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
Is that all? I thought it was about three hundred.
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
You what?
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
For keeps?
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Tobacco today, sex tomorrow. In three or four years, it'll probably be against the law to smile at strangers.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Jesus, man, you're one fucking mess.
And these?
And these?
No thank you.
It was just a thought.
What's your offer?
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Paul. Paul Benjamin.
Yeah, but he's my son. Nothing strange about that. He's my own flesh and blood. But here you got the same name as this man here, and you're not even the same color.
Paul. Rashid. Thomas. Which one is it?
Yeah? And why is that?
You still have that watch Auggie gave you?
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
Good. Lemonade it is.  I'm Paul.
I mean breakfast.
I don't know. For helping me out.
Cut it out, will you? Just cut it out and come back here.
You're joking, right? I mean, that's your way of trying to be funny, right?
It looks like they've met in this apartment.
The end.
No, not the end. The beginning.  His son was just a little boy at the time, but the years passed, and when he grew up, he became a skier, too. One day last winter, he went out by himself for a run down the mountain. He gets halfway to the bottom and then stops to eat his lunch next to a big rock. Just as he's unwrapping his cheese sandwich, he looks down and sees a body frozen in the ice -- right there at his feet. He bends down to take a closer look, and suddenly he feels that he's looking into a mirror, that he's looking at himself. There he is -- dead -- and the body is perfectly intact, sealed away in a block of ice -- like someone preserved in suspended animation. He gets down on all fours, looks right into the dead man's face, and realizes that he's looking at his father.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
I pay Auggie, and I've got nothing. Eight hundred bucks and a ticket to Shit City.
Everything is real in here, honey.  As real as the color of my hair.
What are you sellin' 'em for? Why don't we start there.
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
Well, what if?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
Your friends would.  Your dad would kill me with a machete.
The Japs did it.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
From Carl Heine's boat.  All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Like you couldn't believe.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney.  You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>.  Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
I have told the truth.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Well, why does it?
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
It is.
Apparently.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
As I testified.  It occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  I believe I said that.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  Or would both look the same.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Bye.
Bull fiddle.
Me?  I'm the manager of the band - not the night watchman.
I don't know - but I can feel it right here.  That's one good thing about ulcers - it's like a burglar alarm going off inside you.
Look, stupid, he's ten to one.  Tomorrow, we'll have twenty overcoats!
- Type O.
We're not too late, are we?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
You'd better go fix it.
You better come help me.
Boy, would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar.
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?  Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel?
You - you -
Fat chance!  You call him right back and tell him I'm not going.
Don't give me the musketeers!  How'm I going to keep the guy ashore?
I am.
What are you talking about? You can't marry Osgood.
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
Look, stop treating me like a child. I'm not stupid.  I know there's a problem.
We've been discussing that.  He wants to go to the Riviera - but I sort of lean toward Niagara Falls.
Get me Room 414.
What do you think you're doing?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
Good night, honey.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Interesting.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Yeah - Josephine.
Oh yes, we do!
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
Yes.  He wants me to have supper with him - on his yacht - he's going to pick me up at the pier.
Thirty-four.
That's what I call a louse!  If I were you, Sugar, I'd throw that bracelet right back in his face.
What's with him - he drinks?
You don't say.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Who?
We can have it altered.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We'll adopt some.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
That's good thinking.  Daphne's a push-over for him.
You ain't going nowhere.
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
The instruments are right, but you are not.  I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
It's not the backs that worry me.
We'll take it!
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
I play the ukulele.  And I sing too.
All the girls drink - but I'm the one that gets caught.  That's the story of my life. I always get the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Rough?
That's why I joined this band. Safety first.  Anything to get away from those bums.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Oh, I don't care how rich he is - as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste.
Not at all.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it's time for cocktails.
That's very interesting.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
- and always the same Four Hundred.
You collect shells?
They repealed Prohibition?
Maybe you'd better go after him - if you don't want to lose him.
Well, you know how those millionaires are.  These came for you.
Love it.  Which way?
Yes - that's our hurricane cellar.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Oh, it's not that. It's just that I'm - harmless.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
I don't want to bore you.
Oh, no!
If I ever found a girl that could - I'd marry her like that.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
It's like smoking without inhaling.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Oh, you know - Junior League - charity bazaars - I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.
Nice?  It was suicidally beautiful.
Me?
It's all rather complicated - what we call high finance - but it so happens that the president of the Venezuelan syndicate has a daughter, and -
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
We got different information.
Say, Maestro - where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine's Day?
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Spats Colombo.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.  You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends...
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why, with you.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Yeah.
No.
No, I cant. Were late for a dance lesson. I guess youll have to finish up later.
Its called character. God, youre predictable.
Right. Seven.  Christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
Youre funny.
I dont do naked. My sister? She does naked.
I dont know.
Why?
You stand on your tiptoes.
First of all, its never out of the blue. And second of all--
When youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasnt one of them.
Yeah.
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
Youre judging me?! Oh, thats a good one. Youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. But youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Therapist.
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
You pawned it.
Ahoy!
Uh huh...
That's right--
That's where we come from first?
She was dirty and wet...
Yes mam...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
You won't be goin' to jail again, will you, Daddy?
I'm gon' miss this ol' raggedy place.
Will you help me to find out what camp they sent my father to?
Thank you, Josie Mae.
Goodnight.
That's right!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Children, come here...
David, come back here!
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
Good night...
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
I don't know a damn thing, now stop bothering me about it!
I wanta get some things.
Hope it don't freeze out our baseball game today!
Yeah, just stay where you is...
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!
Oh yeah.
It's that v-chip thing that's inside you, Eric!  The polarity must have been reversed by the electric chair!
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Get out of here Ike, you're too young for this stuff!
Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.
Then move out of the way.
Do as I say, Kyle!
Guess.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's okay, I am done for.
Kyle, check it out.
What is 'fisting'?
-Or monkey fucker-
What the hell is going on?!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Forgive me for saying so, Principal Victoria, but your methods are too... Shall we say... soft?  As head of the PTA, I am exercising my right under article 42 of the PTA code.
And you call yourself a Canadian!  I told you we should of done Leno!
Terrance! NO!
Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid wants.
Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
You don't care.
I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!
No! It can't be!
That's nice, Stan.
Wendy?
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.
Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis direction!
What do you think this is kid?  Lick Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life with consequences you take to the grave!
Check.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Excuse me?
So...
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
It's a little late for you to be up.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
It's steady, good benefits.
I told you not to try anything smart!  I guess you're too much of a maverick to follow a simple order!  And that's just too bad for all of you now, isn't it?
Cool your jets...I'm doing a little damage control.
This is a major screw up on your part, goddamn it!
Great.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Even if we do, it might be too late.
What?  What are you talking about?
I can't!
I'll do my best.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
That is one of my priorities.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
Mac.  What's shaking?
Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
That's affirmative.
Just like Junior did the last time; lane six. All's I know is it's gonna be a closed coffin. My advice to you is to lay low. He puts on a pair of dark 7-Eleven shades, flips up his collar and skulks away.
You have orange whips?
Orange who? Not from 'round here, are ya?
Look Sid, a Buzz Burger. The Faz's favorite lunch. Sid reaches for the plate. Buzz walks over to the booth  and pulls his burger away from Sid.
Wait! That's an aria!
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
brainstorm, Buzz. I admit, I thought it was a rotten idea, but I put up the scratch.  And now we got a beautiful thing.
Theo.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
I ain't nobody's father!
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
That's a laugh. You're all strung out. You're a bowling junkie.
I didn't think so.
That's right, Buzz, and you know when I did it? Last match, last frame. All I needed was one spare for the crown - and I get stuck with the seven-ten, the Fazeli Split.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Hey man, welcome to our parking lot. Lemme give you some advice, if she asks you to dance, make sure her brother's not around. Somebody blew out Junior's pilot light, if you get my meaning.
Buzz Fazeli.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
If I find out Buzz is comin' up short on dwarf bowling, it's lights out for him and pink slips for you. Sid and Breeze look sideways at each other.
No!
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
What's with the bad air between you two, Mr. Kastle?
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
Look who's talking!
Just because your mother signed part ownership of the lanes over to you, doesn't mean you have a right to tell me how to run my business! I can have my lawyers take that deed away from you like that.  Sheila and Kastle sit up.
Bowling "Center"!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Your dad's one of the only nice people in this fucking town. My Dad is slime. Kastle walks over. Theo stands up and shakes Kastle's proffered hand.
Where did your brother escape from?
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Not while I'm in training.
What's plan B?
Plan C...  ...is me.
I may not be a pro bowler, but I'm no amateur man. Sheila moves closer to Theo.
I could let them go for ten.
...lane six. Yes.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I did your dirty work for you Sheila, now fuck off. Theo drives away leaving Sheila standing alone. She watches his car recede with a thoughtful expression, then turns on her heel.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Fifty yards and closing.
Forty yards.
Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
He's right beneath us.
Do you see it?
Geologists?
Maybe older --
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
Wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  You know, Ted said something to me earlier.  I think he's right.  He said, "When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line, you gotta question if you got the right guy."
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
She wired this system.
What if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
What is it?
Maybe we didn't want to come back.
Maybe it's a message of some sort, you know?  See this red here.
Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
I've read it twice, Norman.  It's brilliant.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
The library.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
What?
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
Don't tell me to calm down!
I have to reset the sub.
You don't trust me?
The refridgerator.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream.
Valdomet.
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
For what?
Where are you?
Your watch.
I did do that, didn't I?
You know what I mean.
Did you?
Is it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you?
Don't, Beth.  Please.
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Won't make any difference.  The tapes document everything.
No, why don't --
I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is?
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine.  Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic.
I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself.
Two and a half minutes.  Once we're in the sub.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Her legs are in the way.
Nine hundred feet to surface.
What is it, Harry?
Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space.
Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of those hoaxes?
Unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to Americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
What was that, sir?
Unless it's an act.
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment --
You're lucky those Tuskens didn't boil you before they hung you out to dry.  They're not the friendly sort. You'd best be moving on before they come back.
You mean I generate an energy field?
Could I learn to feel it?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
There are two halves of the Force of Others.  One is positive and will help you if you learn how to use it.  But the others half will kill you if you aren't careful.  This negative side of the Force is called the Bogan, which is where the expression came from, and it is the part that is used by the Dark Lords to destroy their opponents.  Both halves are always present.  The Force is on your right, the Bogan is on your left.  The Kiber Crystal can amplify either one.  The Crystal Darth stole was the last one in the possession of the Jedi.  When he joined the Sith, the power of the Dark Lords was completed.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
Keep it with you always.  You'll have more need of it than I.  It will bring the Force to you.  You've already learned to feel it... Now you must learn to use it.
Have you been checked out?
Yes, sir.
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
What are you saying?
Why?
Good!  I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking around.
See Threepio, come in, See Threepio. I wonder where they are??  See Threepio...
Come back here... Where are you going?
It's too late... We already tested it on Organa Major.  It appears your data never got through.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
For the moment.  We're in the main hangar.  Artoo is trying to plug into the system now.
Death to all bugs !
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Ace of spades.
Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
You weren't thinking...you were dreaming !
Funny...
Yeah.
Marco's sister. Can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... You gotta have nerves of steel ! Reflexes are critical
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
It wouldn't be so romantic if we weren't...
Yeah, sure, I guess.
Zander is going for pilot, too.
I'm gonna do it, Carmen. I'm gonna sign up for Federal Service.
I love you.
We've gotta go get her !
How come we never got together ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Looks like rain.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
Rasczak... Silly name. There ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
Sorry. Carl's a fine boy...
I won't quit !
Owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. That's why MICOM wants onsite assessment.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Not a problem.
Let's get some armor on her, and the we'll get outa this stinkin bug hole !
Then I hope you have a crazy pilot ! Keep the line open, Dizzy !
Figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice, Rico.
Yes, sir.
What's going on, Diz ?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
Not until V'ger withdraws the devices orbiting the third planet.
We will answer and present <U>proof</U> of our answer when it is ready!
Very well, Mr. Chekov, see to it. Viewer off.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Yes, sir, I'll do that.
No...  ... that could also be misinter- preted as hostile, Mr. Decker.  Cloud composition, Mr. Spock?
A tractor beam...
That you left? or that you didn't say 'goodbye'?
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Aye, sir.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
I know this has been painful, Spock. For me too. Thank you.
The point... 
Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you.
We're ready, sir.
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I'll be there.
That's true.  You grow up here?
Yes...
I <u>can</u>?
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
I...
Cast stood me up.
Uh huh.
You got a paperclip?
No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see you tomorrow.
You believe that?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
I can't get it to come out right.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
...yes.
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
...you think that's right...
Morning, darling.
After Drama Group.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Hi.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
I will.
...they run on water.
Now: I'm looking at the...
That Could Be.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
I <u>know</u> my lines...
Sister, I've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
I don't eat vegetables.
Bourbon and Milk.
She's a...
No, you're absolutely r...
<u>Bobby</u>...
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
Mr. Bailey.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Get him on the...
I, actually yes.
But not that <u>way</u>...
Who is that...?
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
You can't do what?
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
Who are these from?
Nothing.  He held her and he wept. Because he...
I know, I know.
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
He treated me as if I were a child...
That's cor...
Find out when Marty Rossen's arriving, get him a bunch of lilacs to send to the broad.
She Doesn't Want to Bare Her Breasts...what, in the "Nude Scene...?" What are we paying her three mil?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
It's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
Later for you, pal.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
You go in her room, take the lilacs from the water, dry them.  Go buy some cellophane, wrap em up, and get a card from <u>Marty</u>.  What's her problem?
I can only write on a manual.
I know the feeling.
The girl was in the car.
For what cause?
No.
Well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
What glasses were you wearing?  Were you wearing your reading glasses...?
How are you getting on with these fine people?
<u>Pay</u> her.
I got a company...give us a million dollars, put their product in the film.
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
Is that one hell of a kid?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Here it is: Statutory r...Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  Hold on, Bobby...  You've got nothing, and you know it.  By God, you know it.  Harassment.  You need a...Even if this was true, you need a witness.  You need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  Now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  Yes, we'd love to have you...Now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
...not at all...
...it is?
Zat what it takes?  I always <u>wondered</u> what it took...
I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate.  I want to be a stud.
Excellent point.
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Then why are you putting on mascara?
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
You lied.  If you lied <u>then</u>, maybe you're lying <u>now</u>.  I can <u>never</u> belive you <u>again</u>!
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No, <u>his</u> mother's always on time.
Not use my words, please!
A <u>suitable</u> boy, will be at <u>this</u> flagpole, <u>on</u> Monday, with a <u>very</u> expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an <u>escort</u> service!
You owe me a quarter.
Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
Alright starve.
Mmmm!  Tasty.  You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
That's nice Ben.
Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that.
Where are you, anyway?
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
That's Rache's song!
Half.  Of him.
And when did that pass?
Actually, never.  They'll always hate you.  There's a gene for it.
Have you still never told him?
We don't KNOW if you've got it, we haven't SEEN it yet!  Now go back and FINISH!
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
They're losing one mother.  They can't lose two.
Rachel, <u>don't</u> do this, you will <u>never</u> forgive yourself!
Rachel's not half my age.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Jackie, she was five minutes late --
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
WE are over.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
I live or I die.
A lot smaller.
What did you do?
I was in there in him.
You're damn right.  I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit.  I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker.  If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead!  I have a life!
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
I need practice.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
No way.  I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
You WHAT?
I don't, but...
See, I know that.
You're a cross-dresser.
And you said...
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
Thanks, but it's under control.
Is that what he told you?
Aw.
Oh please.
Neutral ground.  What's up?
No, there isn't.
Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Jesus.
You don't need to.  I don't expect you to handle them yourself.
Our weekend.  At that sweet little B &amp; B.
Because I can't hurt anyone like this ever again.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
What?
I'll be your guest!
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
I'm always working.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
For rape and murder.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
No, you don't.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
We're not ready.
Fine.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
'Cause Scooby does have a quality that I've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of American today. It's part disillusionment, part hope...
One in a million recover.
Maybe he's that one in a million!
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
OK!
Uh huh.
Say, Ni...
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Any books you like to read for fun?
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Great!
So what's going on?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
That's too bad.
Three.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
So where'd you get in?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Can I see what you have so far?
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
Why? Are we going dancing?
Look Cooper I don't care what my father says, if you embarrass me here you're going to regret it, understand?
We don't have time!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
Used to Filmore, used to.
Well Cooper...
You're going to pay for this...
The transmission is an hour old...
He's in there...
What!
You know, when we reach Kompong Som--
Get your men to do it!
I have your word, Mister President?
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Give that back to me.
It might still be worth trying Riki-Tiki- Tavi.  R...T...T...There's only three combinations of -- T...T...R, or T...R...T...
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
Do you recognize my voice?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Yes, Major.  This looks like it's going to be it.
No, sir.
As soon as you've done that, shut down the communications center.  Lock it up and assign the personnel to base security details.
Yes, sir.
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
That's close enough, Major.
Well, for the same reasons we do, sir. Don't you see?
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Major, I happen to believe in a life after this one, so I believe I will have to answer for what I have done.  I think I can.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Admiral Buldike?
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Well, sir, if the A/C's a really good man, I mean really sharp, why he can barrel that plane along so low - well you just have to see it some time.  A real big plane, like a Sting Ray, zig-zagging in, its jet exhaust frying chickens in the barnyard ---  Has he a chance?.....Hell, yes!  He has one hell of a chance.
Zlat, make sure the secret service boys care- fully search his seven body orifices.
Roger. One-three-eight.
Speed?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Sure, I'll take her up right now.
I just got another blast on the CRM-114, and the damned thing decodes: Wing Attack, Plan-R.
Forget it.
Hellnno, Major.  I was just trying to think the thing through.
Everything still checks out okay.
Listen, give me a shot quick!
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
How the hell do I know?  Maybe the war's over.
That's the point.
I said that's the point!
First lesson in War College:  Never under- estimate your enemy.
I don't know.
Can I have some?
Yeah.
You know, like, like, I would always think, uh, you know, what if I make the wrong move? But maybe there isn't any right move. You know? I mean, look at us. You know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same TV. Nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "Oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" And see, that's what makes me freak. Because I can do anything I want, as long as I don't care about the result.
Yup.
What's it about?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Right now?
The dude wants it.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Y- s-sure it did.
Yeah, man.
Alright. 'Bye, Buff.
You're fascist, man. Neofascist.
Hey.
That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Good. See you later.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
Hey, thanks, man.
You know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? But, like, you know, have it set in here. You know, like, like, like, with her and shit. You know, like, you know, like, "Closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
It's nice here. It's different.
Yeah, totally.  So, uh, what do they interview you about?
Hi.
He is.
Mm.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure." Right? I hated it. I had to get out. So I was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and I, uh, I had this big fucking knife and I chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later I was a free man.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Short pieces, huh? You should try to write songs.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Actually, the only thing I gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to Greaseball-land.
Who were you talking to?
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Oh fuck.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
Yes.
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
You don't know?
They're just people. Alright? They got feelings, you know?
Okay, so maybe later.
Man?
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
But do you stand for anything?
What? What do you stand for?
What feelings?
I don't know.
So you sold ninety thousand units. So what? Does that mean you're a genius? You're a great artist? You're higher up the ladder? You got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
Yeah, good.
Hey, I though you guys were coming to the show, man?
Yeah.
For a while.
Well, I mean, we jammed a couple of times. You know, I mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before Danny signed us.
What do you mean?
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
Burnfield. No place like it.
Yeah, yeah. That's the fucking problem.
Hey, you know what? Go fuck yourself.
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
It's stupid.
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
It's pretty exciting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mine too.
Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I can't believe you're still here.
I think I gotta go.
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
Yeah?
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Well, just, you know, have 'em call me. Y-you know where to find me, right?
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Jeff!
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
You just became a statistic!
That's right.  So all we have to do is watch a bunch of movies and learn from their mistakes.
Well...
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
WHAT?!  That's insane!!!  Why would I go to the police?
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
That was gas, Sweetie.
Uh, yes.  Yes you did.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Hee-hee-h-wait a minute.  Hold on, now. What do we do before a big game?
Or, I could get my own horse...
Hannah, we've...
That's Itchy, alright.  How many y'need?
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Uh...maybe?
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Hi, Artie.
Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while?
I'll take it.
I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower?
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
So long.
What about all those ideas you had?
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ...
I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
If you please.
Twenty-two.
That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter.
Was I?  I'm sorry.
I just don't.
You did.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
Yes, I did.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
That's where the popcorn business comes in.  You buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Uh-huh.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I wrote that with my heart.
Thank you.
Oh no.  I couldn't let it out of my house.  You'll have to finish it here.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
I'll come early tomorrow.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
What scene?
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  Max, what's a good men's shop in town?  The very best... Well, go there !
Tails.  That's ridiculous.
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
What right do you have to take me for granted?
You're a darling.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
Yes, Norma.
Goodbye.  Norma.
Madame is waiting.
Who said you could?  Who asked you to?
They found your car in the garage.  They are going to tow it away.
That's right.
What car?
No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture?
You trying to be funny?  -- because I'm all out of laughs.  I'm over a barrel and I need a job.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Was it a sudden quarrel?  Had there been any trouble between you before?
You know better than to interrupt me.
The cameras have arrived, Madame.
Oh, yes, yes.  They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
Maybe it was just an accident.
Who didn't?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
Come on, let's ride.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
Just like that?
Why not? You're a good-looking girl. And I'm--- available.
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
It's the truth. In twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
Don't think I'm weak, just because I'm a woman. I have Power. Give in, stop fighting me, Ethan. I always get what I want.
I don't know. You seem afraid.
Oh, no thanks.
Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.
As brave as my father. As wise.
But what for?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
No, MR. Danvers.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the Phantom Zone.
But what about other people? Don't you miss them?
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
But it's impossible.
No, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. Forget I mentioned it.
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Hey, man, that's a great name for a cocktail!
The kid needs a man to show him --
I meant all the choices here. All this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  This is some picnic!
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Could you get me Superman's autograph?
Take me, for instance. Going back to middle America after having become a Metropolis sophisticate --
What's that?
Dishwasher? Any luck?
They said I lost it on the subway, but it ain't the truth! It was a pickpocket took it!
Man, them people was crazy! How they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "Hold the pickle! Hold the lettuce! Extra onions! Special sauce! No special sauce!" Ain't nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
First rip-off, man! Supposed to be 225 bucks a week! You know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  Federal tax! State tax! Social Security tax!
One.  And a half.
Yeah. A raise . .
Or socks.
First question got to be "Where."
They ain't got captains?
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't make me talk, please. I got enough problems just hangin' on.
We back in Metropolis?
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Her name's Lorelei Ambrosia. She's Webster's Girl Friday.
I'd wash that out with some iodine...  Okay, Mercurochrome.
Whoopee.
Hello.
He's bound to slip up sooner or later.
It could make weather!
Gus Gorman, this is my Psychic Nutritionist.
We already have a super-tanker.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Really?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
We'd better talk.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Wrong.
He knows where the Eiffel Tower is, Olsen.  You do, don't you, Kent?
I asked the right question.
That little black box, Mr. Luthor, I mean -- what's it for?
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Well . . . it's been more like a fortress than a home.  Until now.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
It will. Starting with your own.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
We must combine our strength.
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. Wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
I'm sorry to see you go.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
Politely?
Well, I'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because I had a visit from a very good nurse.
Of course it is. Do you know what the sun is? Why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. A bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Absolutely!
I'll try. . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. Never fraternize with the help. Keep too your own station. Am I clear?
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
That's because there's nothing to figure out. Now will you please pay attention. I'm not through insulting your father.
Why, Lois, I didn't know . . . Who is he?
A toupee that flies?
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
You're just an experiment, freako!
Good. Let's hope he stays that way.
First, I have fun.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Thank you.
What's she doing in California?
I know son, I know...
Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Not really, no.
What the  --  !
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Yes, but I'm the only one who knows him. I  --  I really like the guy. And he likes me.  I think. I mean, I could talk to him, you know? And he could talk to me.  Anytime...
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
I will as soon as I get the sand out of my nose.
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
You got wax in your ears?
I'm wearing it.
Of course I can. I love you.
It's because I'm an intrepid girl reporter, Jimmy.  Besides, the chief of detectives has the hots for me.
I bless the day you came to us, son. You know that. But some people wouldn't understand.
Lara, please...
I guess I got carried away
You've got me? Who's got you???
Who's Clark? One of your colleagues?
You think they're strange?
Oh.
It must feel great.
What about this X-Ray vision of yours?
Otis, were you up to your old tricks?
But...why?
Oh, that. Listen  --  you're busy  --  and it's a long story --
No, Superman, of course not. You do get around, don't you.
Couldn't have said it better myself.  Now all this  --  --  west of the Fault is the most expensive real estate in the world. Los Angeles. San Diego. San Francisco. And here  --  --  is just hundreds and hundreds of miles of cheap desert land. Land that happens to be owned by Lex Luthor Enterprises. Well...  ...call me a fool, but ...it did occur to me that if a conventional five hundred megaton bomb were to explode at exactly the proper stress point --  --  that would trigger the upheaval that would cause the San Andreas Fault to 'do its thing.'  Ah, it would've been so nice, y'know...
Maybe I should get help.
Yes...fine.
And Zoe?  How's Zoe?
Are you still in touch?
Which one?
I hope she gets better.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Okay.
I don't know.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
She said she's got to be home by nine.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Yes.
I didn't say that.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear.  They were the only parents who did that, together like that.  I guess they're what you might call hippies.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
And winter?
I feel like a princess.
Would you like a cup of tea, Billy? There's a piece of cake left.
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
I don't want you to lie.
Wanda does these photographic things.  That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
Why am I calling you?  You're my father.  I'm not supposed to call you?  What's the matter with wanting to talk to you, Daddy?
You can't come here.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
Do you have this agreement with you?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
Don't know.  Food banks, welfare, church charity.  They scrape by.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
Yes.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Why not?
Yes.  I do now.  Now that I'm telling it.
The ramp?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
But Charlene...
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
How do you do, Mr. Falco.  If you know anything about horses, sit a minute.  Help yourself to a glass of this N.Y. State champagne - that's what my husband buys me.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
You told him that?
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Is it news to you?
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
No punch line.  Maybe I was just admiring your know-how---yours and Falco's.
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him.  And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER  I'm not fighting with you, puss...
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
We're friends, Harvey - we go as far back as when you were a fresh kid Congressman, don't we?
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
I have a message from your sister.
I'm a schoolboy - teach me, teach me.
I'll listen one more minute.
You're picking up my lingo, hon.
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
I like that, too.  Look, J.J., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps - to oblivion.  We're going great, but please play it my way. I cased this kid. Know his ins and outs...He's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze.  Do little Sidney a favor: squeeze! - You know, J.J. - the porcupine bit - needles.
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
What does that mean - integrity?
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
I call him the boy with the ice cream face!
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
At the bar - Sidney...
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
We stick in each others craw.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother.  To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
What ship?
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
He's intuitive - he knows he's getting fired!
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
I made you write a beautiful song...
Why did you marry me, Miles?  Why did we have these two children?  You don't need us.  Your heart and your mind are in here.  But it doesn't love you like we do.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
No one must follow your work.
Let me try mine.
Oh, great.  And what happens to her?
That is one of my mission parameters.
Why?
I sense injuries.  The data could be called pain.
She intends to change the future somehow.
Dyson.
What?
Where'd you learn all this stuff?
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
I love you, John.  I always have.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Yes.
I don't know.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
I'm Steve. What's your name?
What's that mean?
You bet.
With more what? More what?
David, I don't understand a thing about you. You're a Jew. Are you a Jew?
Colonel. Pleasure.
Furtwngler's in a different category.
Then you're going to kill me.
There have been messages for you.  A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
Shut the door, Emmi. Sit down, Emmi. We're going to keep him waiting, too.
I can't do this. It's not right.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
You didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
They were Jews, they had to leave. They were right to leave.  I could not leave my country in her deepest misery. After all, I am a German.  I... I stayed in my homeland. Is that my sin in your eyes?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I wasn't told. I just knew it.
Well, I'm just beginning to develop my theme. Isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? Okay, so they played on your insecurity. That's human, understandable. But, there is one guy who doesn't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah, the number one man your old pal, Adolf. He thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, I want Wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get Wilhelm. So, Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna, I'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin. That's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. Hard. Why did you stay? Why did you play for them? Why were you the flag-carrier for their regime?  Jealousy?
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Me? Never.  Never.
Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture; how could I know such a man?  I
Love 'em, Helmuth. I give up. What are you holding in your hand?
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwngler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwngler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
When you got to the crescendo.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
All.
We will, kiddo.
No.  Not yet.  Not for about forty years.
Right.
Freezing.
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
Why?
You're not supposed to.
Then how are you supposed to get back?
I hate the weird ones.
The stock will turn.
Now, look...
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
Oh, no... you.
Alright... okay...
I'm sorry, about this...
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
You're the one who started running.
Nicholas Van Orton?  What are you, a czar?
Nicholas...
I don't know, nobody does.  I'm an employee.
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
It's mine...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
One brother, one sister.
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
That's why it's a classic.  Come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
About me?
Never better.
I redecorated.  What about you?
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
What have they been doing to you?
Do you know how to change a tire?
Stop this.  It's not true...
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Yes.
I hope.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Humor me with specifics.
May I make two suggestions... ?
You mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Did you worry about him?
There was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  The police took him.  They left this address, in case anyone...
What gentleman, Maria?
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
You're joking.
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
And what kind of sleeper?
It's a question.
But if the group knows it's being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  The deception is minor.
I, I just can't...
How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  Water hammer, something like that?
What happened after you smelled it?
Yes.
It was a stupid thing to do.
Sure.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Then who called me?
No --
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
Well, I've never lived with beauty.  You must love working here.
-- no one could.  No one lives any nearer than town.  No one will come any nearer than that.  In the night.  In the dark.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
That's why we're here.
Don't tell me Boston is different from New York.
A blank canvas!  I could paint your portrait, directly on you. Or maybe not.  So, you?  Husbands? Boyfriends?  Girlfriends?  Where do you live?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
I have a loft.
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
I'm a gracious host.
Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
Okay.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself?
I dunno ... Maybe they do.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to.
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn.
She used to pinch 'em off me.  Funny that.  One thing she never tried to get me to stop.
Been busy, have you.
Well, that kind of security can't be bought.  Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
How'd you manage that, then.
I gave him yours.  Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative.  I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny.  Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
Something like that, yeah.
That's what was estimated.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
She told you all about my details but not about his.  Lovely.
And how did you get it?
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day.
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Never thought of that.  Busman's holiday.
Yeah, I guess you are.
So what's your beef, pal?
What am I doing?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
Yeah?
Makin' trouble for someone?
There's more than a measly few grand in this.
What's in it?
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
I don't want you here, Terry.
Be seein' you.
Ann. Will you come in?
Yes. Thank you.
Ann--
Ann--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
Oh, Mr Crane--
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
Huh.
Uh-huh.
That right.
That's right! Dry cleaning--remember the name. It's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. All I need is $10,000 to open my first store, then I use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. Well, me and a partner. Cleanliness, friend. There's money in it. There's a future. There's room to grow... Say, that's looking pretty good. Let's see it with the hairpiece on...
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Ed.
Right! Strictly business.
Yeah.
*Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
She's a rare one.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
How much to they want, Dave?
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
Oh, don't be a grump.
Who?
It was Big Dave's.
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
And now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in San Diego. You asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. Well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. Somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. They called, they demanded money...
...who among us is in a position to say...
Oh, hell. Drink?
No thanks.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't know how you're fixed for money.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?
How d'ya like them apples?
Russians exploded an A-bomb.
We're just closing, friend.
Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... He's the decedent.
Calm down.  I found it!
Hurry up!
I made it outside.  I'll co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  Help is on the way.  Just sit tight.
Mind if I have a look?
Where's the head?
Call me Vince.
I've been down there.  It links up to the old sewer system.  I can guide you out.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Dr. Green has to see you!
You're asking me?  I don't even know how to load this thing.
I'd say we're in its home.
Lovely bouquet.  After our last case, Vince took me out for a draft beer. As I recall we split the check.
Let me help.  I can take care of everything.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
What do you do?
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Don't be a wuss.  Come on.
You're color blind.
Quiet.
Keep the animal quiet.
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
Maybe not.
You have time to talk?
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
He was afraid of himself.  He tried suicide once.  He was ill.  Manic depressive.  He had wild emotional highs and lows.  Not a happy affliction for a scientist.  He'd been revered in our community.  By the end he was a joke.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
Behind me.  Over there.
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
Gone.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
The planetarium!
What are you going to do?
Whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
It's the busy season.
Why wouldn't I?
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
I'm the creator.
You're the star.
--You never had a camera in my head.
Now.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
So when are you leaving?
Yeah, what happened?
How about them?
This is where it started.
Things.  Things that doesn't fit.  Maybe I'm being set up for something. You ever feel like that, Marlon?  Like your whole life has been building to something?
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Surgery.  The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night.  Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors.  Non-union contractors.  Monsters.  We're starting with an amputation.
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji.  Is that it?
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
It looks so small.
The whole area's being evacuated.
You're welcome, Truman.
I don't understand.
You must listen.  Everybody's pretending, Truman.
Good.  Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
I'd ask for identification.
You called 911. Except the call was intercepted.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Working with?
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Brought on by what?
Of what?
Show you right on a map.
No. I've been watching your career for a good while. Back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
He just let it explode.
That's what I'm saying.
When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
I'm not sure. A virus --
What's wrong, Scully?
They're trying to divide us on this, Scully. We can't let them.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
Mulder -- what are you doing?
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
Evidence of a massive infection.
I need you there with me. I need your expertise on this. The bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
That I don't know. But if it's through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it doesn't respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
It may be extraterrestrial.
I have no idea.
Any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
Come on!
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
After what you saw last night -- after all you've seen -- you can't just walk away --
Just like that --
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
No -- it's --
Yes you can. You're going to make it, Scully.
About what?
Agent Scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. That you wanted to go back.
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
Yes.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
She said convincingly.
Do you think that's funny?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
You were right.  There's a part of him that knows the truth.  About what he did, about himself.
Not Stargher, not really.  He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster.  And an innocent child.  If I could reach the boy.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Absolutely.  Abigail...
I got it.
's broken.
You're kidding me.
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
That was with Edward.  She's accustomed to his world.  Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  She's "lost."  Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening.  And get her out.  Until then, she's at his mercy.
Absolutely.
Prevacid.  For my stomach.
No.
I doubt that.
Awaiting his arrival.
What about the cat?
Now?
Nicole Labetzki.  Victim seven. Forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a K-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
That was the man that brought me some money when Harry died. He said Harry had been anxious at the last moment.
Why don't you leave this town - go home?
Dr. Winkel.
Well you read this.
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
If we have to see the Porter we'd better go.
Holly.
I'm so sorry.
Wait here.
A parrot...Let it go.
I'll put these flowers in water.
Well, don't preach wisdom to me. You talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
There's something wrong. Did you tell Calloway about meeting Harry?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
What did you say? I'm sorry...
They'll be returned, miss.
That's all right, miss, don't worry. We're used to it - like doctors.
No.
I can't say that I have.
Pin it on a...
It wasn't petrol.
You're not locking her up?
Calloway, you haven't shown me one shred of evidence.
I can't. He disappeared...
I suppose you don't believe me.
She's right. It's none of my business.
Of course.
Heard of Harry Lime?
Goodness, that's awkward.
I want to talk to you.
Tough...tough...Don't worry, old man, they won't hurt her.
As long as they can use you?
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
At the end of every chapter --
But he said he died instantaneously.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Will you give me...
But you will.
The Roumanian?
How do you do.
All right - I'm mad. I've seen a ghost...
Coming to the point, please.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
What's he saying?
You saw it?
Yes.
No, no. He came late after they carried him to the Joseph Statue.
Das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
Never.
His name?
Okay.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Nice work.
I think we're about half way.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
A bit fucking late.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
Exactly.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
It's just the sky, Richard.
No one follows that midrash.
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
He's an asshole.
Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint.  Give it to me.
Let's look at the fucking thing.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
What's he care about?
He's at a home out here.
Good question. Both.  Aleph...
About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick....
Why should I submit?
You shouldn't.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
I'll go look....
Nothing. Let's go....
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
That doesn't seem to be happening, does it?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Let's just say I've done due diligence.
Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews.
So you're saying it's not true.
To hear them read Torah.
I can't help what I think.
This is me.
How did you...?
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
What part of Germany are you people from?
Forget Manzetti.... Take on something simple. Something you can actually accomplish.  Maybe he'd be more valuable in the city.
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up?
Who told you that?
Get out of here....
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
You want to kill a Jew. I already did.
What's that?
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
He was funny.
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
So what?
We redesigned the timing mechanism. It can't possibly malfunction.
I was just trying to make a point. If --
Danny, please, we don't want to know.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Yes.
I can't... I just don't know how to...
But your man isn't quite a God!
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Johana, am I boring you?
You're right.  You're fired.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
What was he like, when he was little?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Exactly!  What is it Johana?  You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
Italy!
The Mamma's there too.
What else is there?
You're going to hold me up at a time like this?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
And... does the voice come back?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
Enzo...
They say I'm like Lazarus.  You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
I don't have one.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Your mother?
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Well that's very nice of you.
Tea... or whiskey?
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Lucky I was there to save you.
You jumped in?
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
Why?
I got fired.
I'm still here.
No... tell me.
Absolutely positive.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
In my apartment?
Of course, that's what they're for.
In the spring when he melts!
He isn't going to breathe.
For one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, I wish I knew.
What's your first move?
I'm gonna pay a visit to the K.L.F. See if they've got the 411 on Santa's location. I'll check in with you when I know more.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Yeah, no kidding.
So don't show a picture.
Mazel Tov!
She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz.
I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa?
It's cool. It's cool. Aveenooh Shalom Alechem, brother.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am?
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
Why not?
Mmmyes.
I drink.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
The elderly man I told you about.
Let me see it 
At four. He will be there at four.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
I'll miss you too, honey --
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
That's what I don't understand -- why should it come here -- and why didn't it stay here? It's got trees and bushes here -- outside nothing but cement and asphalt.
I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
But all those fancy courses were about the dead, Jerry, not the living.
It's better you don't know.
That was unfortunate.
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
And I never will- you know what's between us  we're a thing But this is serious competition.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
No  not yet.
And did you find the leopard?
Absolutely sure.
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways 
We will 
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
Kiki, Galbraith said something to me once, -- something you ought to know. We were talking and he said that people were like that ball on the fountain at the hotel --they got pushed around by things bigger than themselves. That's the way it was with us -- and we were too small to see it that way.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
You a tourist?
Mr De Moraes is due back from Brazil late this evening. Mrs De Moraes is out and not expected before eight. Do you wish...
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes?  The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Disney! How inter...
What... What are you talking about?
Oh no. Youll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
Im impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
When did you get back?
I... Well, were burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but its late and with the funeral...
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Ive had a long and unpleasant day. Im tired and Im angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leons boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why havent you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
You know hed have had him killed, dont you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
Something like that.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
What are you doing? You cant. I...
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. Theyll tell you. Call them!
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
Im fine standing, thank you.
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
You...  Jesus Christ!
No. A poor little rich boy who thought hed save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Like youll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didnt I hear you right?
Whos the guy? Whos the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate Id have had to kill him.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Its up to you whether they walk or not.
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
... Fine. Ill go for the safe place.
Who?  Martin... Hes Martin...
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Oh no. Im all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
Look, I dont think youre fully aware of what youre playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why dont you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Im overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. Im terribly sorry to disturb you but theres been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
We need a double-room and as I understand youre here alone wed be much obliged if youd agree to move to a single room...
The ladys not a friend. Shes a whore.  Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - youre the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Shut up!
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
I take it you dont know where he is, then?
I know his work better than I know him.
A lachat, trois ou quatre mille. En location, cinq cent. Mais a pourrait faire plus. Je ne sais pas. Cest pas vraiment mon truc.  I dont know any Austrian, Xavier.
Figlio di puttana. Youre the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Thats just it. The sonofabitch didnt ask for help from his colleagues...  Testa di cazzo! Hiring some amateur outsiders to fix you... He hasnt gone to hell too soon... And neither will you, Mr Lamont!
Their last suspected kill occurred two years back, though your Spitzes now probably do no more than bankroll the group. Still, Id watch my step. These people are well-connected, Laurent; former Israeli prime minister, etc. The ladys also president of an international Zionist organisation... Anyway, you get the picture.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Of course I am, it's just that...
So... pretend it's not a game.
Yes, my lord.
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Tremoille... don't.  Please...
Do you think I could have some water?
Louis... water and fresh straw!
Right.  Raymond... a priest.
Yes, I am.  I'm an archer who can read and write.  Who do you want to write to?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Come with me...
Jeanne, no...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
Not yet!
Do as I say!
I'm fed up with taking her orders. She swore she'd defeat the English before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  Look at the mess we're in!  That's her mess, not mine...!  We're worse off then if she'd never come at all!  ... now do as I say and Sound the Retreat!
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Yes...
To avoid killing anyone.
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  Don't you understand?  They want proof that God is on their side... and the only way they're going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
Am I... am I dead?
God defeated the English, not me.
I'll be right here... I promise.
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
In a village called Domremy.
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
Is it here?  Now?  In this room?
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims.  You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Don't look at the cost, look at what it brings.  What is your last offer?
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
You really think she's been sent... by God?
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Does he have hair?
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
Not yet.
Perfectly.
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I might ask you the same question.
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
No, I...
I don't think so.
Do you think you are ready?
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
He never says his name.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
I'll get Dr Luczak, we can trust him.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
Dorota.
Come in! come in!
Dead.
What are you doing?
What?
I haven't seen him.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
People I know. They said you're an important man.
Yes, please.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
I can look after myself!
That's also my business.
You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Pig!
Liar, you fell asleep. Pig!
I know. But last summer, I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square. I saw someone I knew. A singer. Her husband's an actor. They're old friends.  I've written their names down. And their address. If they're still there. Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki. Good people. Majorek, you go into the town every day. Would you try and make contact? Ask them if they'd help me get out of here?
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Where do you live?
I am... I was a pianist.
Not yet.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
The Alps.
I'll be back.
She's stunted, that's one thing.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
I'd like to make a swap.
No.
No, words. You have never heard words?
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
It's quite safe, they are managing...
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
I don't have to.  You'll be bustin' in on the Chief of Police just up the hall. 
Billie.  You ready?
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
No.  Never saw him before.  He's a dick, though.
I had some appointments.
What?
Use Salino.  It'll take a little longer, but there won't be any holes in it.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
You ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. There's a depression on ya know.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
Just give us what ya can, Benny. We'll send a truck down.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
Then you'll do it?
Neither are we.
And?
It was too noisy.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
The porters say he runs a braced card game in one of the cars.  $100 minimum, straight poker.  Last time he pulled in here ten grand heavier than he left New York.
Get a couple extra guys in the line, then.  We'll give him the shut-out.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
He wants to put a half million on Syphon.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
What!  Don't give me that crap you little weenie.  How do I know you ain't gonna take a powder.  You come to a game like this, you bring your money.
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Think nothin' of it.
Just do what I tell ya and everything'll be jake.
You move right along, don't ya.
What the hell's the matter with you. We coulda met at a club or somethin'.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
I'm in.
No.
All right, Hooker, but you take it on the lam, and we'll shoot you down on sight.
On the nose!  I said place.  Place it on Syphon.  That horse is going to run second.
We missed him.
This is the last time I expect to see you down here.
Don't crack wise to me, flatfoot. I spent a lotta time in dumps like this, eatin' Gondorff's dust while the bunco squad gets rich tippin' him off.  But it's not gonna happen this time.  We're not even gonna let the police know we're here.  If you keep your mouth shut and do a job, there'll be a promotion in it for ya.  And you better take it, cause I can make ya work for us without it.
I think he will.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
You know how they are... sex...
You've got to get your mind off this.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Dorothy!
You're talking like a crazy person,
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
I didn't.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
There!
Tch-tch-tch --  Well, goodbye, Miss Wynant.  You wouldn't drive slowly, so you don't get a tip.
Yes.
Why don't you try him again?
Yes.
Oh, yeah?  People fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  I knew you were lying.
Don't lie to me.
You see how much we have to say.
He said that father's in town. He's been seeing Julia right along.
Who's is it?
Okay.  There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better.  Come on.
Man to man, I'm not.
What about Jorgensen?
I think we're on the right track.
Nunheim!
Could this be him?
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
--was Wynant's.
Yesterday.  I gave her a thousand dollars.
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
That's a lie, Lieutenant...  Anybody that says that is a liar.
Marian!  Marian! Don't go! I'll behave!  I'll do anything!  Don't go, Marian!
How can I help but mind? I'm constantly humiliated...  just because I haven't money.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Chris!
Never mind.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Good.
Is Julia going with you?
No.
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
That's all right.
Slim.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
Listen.  "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do  they....
Thank you.  Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders -  Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
Oh, this is Andy --
You got types?
Who is she?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Rye.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
They were kidding you.
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
He's just been for a walk.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I've got hunch.  I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Not with all your money!
Nick!
Wynant's body?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Well, don't they?
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner..... 
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
I don't know.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
Yes.
Maybe Miss Wolf has them.
I'm fired.
Baghdad.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I know you think this is crazy, but a couple of hours from now you're going to be one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there.
Wha...
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
We're not going to find anything standing here.  Let's get to climbing.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
So we wait.
I heard!
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know that.
And let me guess who is.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Wes--
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Yeah, the deed to the Brooklyn bridge.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
Yeah.  I meant... You know what I'm going to do with it?  I'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray.  All tricked out and cherry.  I'm going to be so sweet.
Wh-what do you think--
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
I'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
They're going to kill us!
Right now I wouldn't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns.
What does it look like I'm doing?
You don't have to imagine it.  Not anymore.  Now all you've got to think up is what it's going to buy you.
Not when you're up here with the gold, I guess not.
Wes is dead!
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
I don't want to die.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
I don't know.  Something Wes had taught me.  I think it means "Don't shoot. We're your friends."
And then shoot them.
Sun rises in the East.  We go the opposite direction.  May not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards Saudi Arabia.
No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
Yeah, but why me?  What if the car doesn't stop?
Don't make so much out of it.  Only reason I haven't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I've been too busy figuring ways to stay alive.  Believe me; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had.  I'm no better than anybody else.  I've just been busier.
I don't know.
He'll slow down.
A headache?
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly.  You can use that when you surrender.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
What is it?  You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
Naw, nothing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
You ever think about it?  You ever worry?
It's a container.  Break the seal.
Those soldiers have got loafers on.  What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
It's not a hundred miles.  It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain:  Pure desert, mountains, a river.  If the map is even real.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
They're not...I had the pictures. They're not supposed to be here!
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
You've seen enough.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Then what?  It can't go on forever. You know it can't.
AH UGH.
They're watching us now.
I've said many times before, and I guess I'll have to repeat it again for your...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
What?
Incredible!
Not very encouraging.
You're in violation.
I don't care.
What have you done, Cut your hand?
All right...
Yes.
...to me.  I think I'm dying.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
We can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
Treat. We treat devices.
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
I don't know. There's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
Congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
Me, too.
You got it.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Nothing.
Stay to your left.
What's wrong?
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Helluva fuck factor.
He's my brother...
Stay in the truck.
Look, it's important.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Awright! How bout you, Glass, how's that chip shaking?
Fuck factor ten.
I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
She wanted to cook me breakfast.
Ain't that a shit--
That feeling won't last long.
Sir, I--
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Where did you find it?
erect in sweater, arms folded.
He bows, goes. Door shuts behind him.
I had exactly twenty thousand lire. I had just cashed a traveler's check and put it in my wallet.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
But--
Umm.
Smart. London, eh?
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
I don't want to see you at all!
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
No, not at all!
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
No, to you--M'sieu <u>Monescu</u>.
No, Captain, I tell you--
The tennis player?
Please.
Right.
The six--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doa Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Lily, you must listen to me.
Not particularly.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh!
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
That's what you need!
What shade of powder do you use?
Peaches and cream.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father--  which, fortunately, I am not--
You're hired!
Together.
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
And you expect me to believe that?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
Lovely.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
To me he seems rather nervous.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words! 
But you saw it here.
About half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  But it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled.
Yes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic.
Lewis...
Rose Calvert.
I felt like black.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Almost as good as you.
No.
I know what ice fishing is!
Jack.
Well, here you are.
You're welcome. Rose.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
It is that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
Never let go.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
You think she was really there?
Just tell us what you can --
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
How'd you ever get away with it?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
Lumber, ma'am--spent all my life out there piling up a bank balance--  --and now gosh darn it--"Honest Jack"--that's what they call me--is goin' to see the world.
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
We'll be expecting you.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
So you washed it off!
Good-by.
There's soft music--
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
When?
Thanks.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Who with?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
I'll take one. 
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
It's a pleasure.
Think again--
No--not quite.
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading.  I'll take this one.
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
In New York.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
I thought I put you to bed.
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game.  Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
You don't shoot squirrels.
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Well, he has a straw hat--
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
What for?
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
The country boy's about due.
Thanks to me.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Thirty one's and two ten's?
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Because you ran after me.
Well I'm the man to see.  Besides Sheriff I'm also tax collector, Captain of the Fire Brigade, and Chairman of the Non-partisan Anti- Chinese league.  A man of many Parts.  Got a place to stay yet?  I Also sit on the Townlot Commission.  Got a couple of Lovely cottages coming up for Rent.  Here, let me show you...
You will after tonight.  Bet on it.
Fair enough.  You know I got to Admit, you got a lot of bark on You comin' up here like this.
Well... 'bye.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
Here it come: one-two-
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
Ignore her?
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Awful lot of money.
What was that all about?
Colorado's closer
Easy now... That mare's in season.
What about her?
Just answer.
Doesn't suit you.
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Oh, all right.
All right, well, good night.
Just thinkin' out loud.  Forget it.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
I need it.
You're the boss.  One thing, though.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
There's all kinds of horses, Ain't there?  Same with Cowboys. What they do's their affair.  I Don't preach and I don't judge.  I Ain't no dog-catcher.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
They're carrying guns in town.
I can feel your pain.
My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese.  His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai...  His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper.  It was a city of unlimited possibility.
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
I'm sorry.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
- We all want what we can't have?
Standard equipment. The world's automobile manufacturers seem to be in some kind of mad war to see who can provide the most beverage cup holders.
Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
I know what I saw -
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude, Queen Victoria herself named the port "Aberdeen Harbor" in their honor?
Tide and current charts. Work backward from the body - find where the ship sank.  Where did you get the boat?
Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy.
Wait a minute -  I've got it. There! Off the port bow!
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Depends what number you write.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
You insist on calling all the shots.  And by the way: I am not a helpless girl.
And number two?
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
... Didn't we once investigate Harmsway?
Actually, you're just in time.  Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you?
Sabotage?
I was just getting to the interesting part!
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Send him a $10,000 campaign contribution, and explain I have no control over what my journalists write -
- But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond?
You come with me -  You stay here.
What's in the box, General?  What's in the box???
That's a lie.
Junior spends time with his child.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
You were in hell?
Do you think you won?
I guess it proves you really care about me. You hung in there.
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
It is just a regular card.
Look! Don't try to get ahead by riding our backs.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
No, if I rest any longer, I won't sleep tonight. May I use your bathroom to wash up a bit?
Tolerable well.
What difference does it make if it's persimmon, oak tree or huckleberry bush?
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Oh, I wasn't pointing my finger at you. Hey, you have to think of yourself. A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut your throat while you sleep. There are too many bad people out there.
In some things. When we were children, there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you didn't have something on you that didn't make a X.
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
I want to hear what happened. My brother is a jackass and a damn fool. The both of you have been as scarce as hen's teeth.
Oh, this looks GREAT, Mom!
Okay...
Woody!  Buzz!
I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
Rocky!  The ramp!
Mm-hmmmmm.
HO-YAAAHH!!!
Watch yourself!!
T-O-Y.  Toy.
What are you talking about?  Where's that bonding strip?!
Sure is a hairy fellah.
Then we've no time to lose!!
Go away.
Still no word from Star Command. We're not that far from the spaceport --
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Look at me!  I can't even fly out of a window!
I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
But why would Andy want me?
Yes Sir!
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Woody!  The rocket!
Not today!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
What's with him?
So, you see?  We're friends now, guys.  Aren't we, Buzz?  You bet.  Gimme a hug.
She's sick!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
Nothing.
Yeah, hey Buzz.  Let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  Gimme five, man!
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Sid!!!
Excuse me.
Didn't you know he made things?
Ah, you should see the swan! His masterpiece. Now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
Let me in.
Almighty Jove in the shape of a swan.
Everything is gone, now.
I'm not too young. Juliet was my age.
He's not here.
How much do I pay him?
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar.  And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
I was just waiting for the right time.
Goodbye Arnie.
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own.  We have to allow her space --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
I got that.  How was your day?
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar?
No --
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
Yes, sir!
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't believe you.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
Guzman, Tomas, Esteban --
Not this time.
Where?
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
Well, Javier Rodriguez, you've done a very good job, but we'll take care of it from here.
What is the name of your informant?
If I can.
What is it you want me to do?
A small thing.  Nothing really.
It's possible.
Michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
I have money --
She hasn't called you?
I'd like to bring you up to Washington, walk you around our side of things, and share some of the information we've been able to develop on your cartels.
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
What do you mean?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
You've stabbed me, man.
Jesus.
Did you bring the cards?
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Out.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Easy for you to say.
Yes.
Well, it isn't.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Happy birthday.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
Fuck, OK.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Do you recall the school motto?
Aye.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
Some of his solo stuff's not bad.
I don't rate that at all.
Despite the Academy award?
Clear enough, Moneypenny. This should present no significant problem.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Cut it out.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
So we've just come from Tommy's funeral and you're telling me about a skag deal?
But you don't have the money?
Come on, Mark, every cunt knows you've been saving up down in London.
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
The Sick Boy method.
Why, thank you.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
And how did you breach the Barrier?
It could. Yes.
The ship....
Raise shields.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
The same. From what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. And they've taken hostages.
Have the Klingons responded?
What is it you seek?
Then we'll have to get them out the old fashioned way.
Mr. Scott, you're amazing.
The lyrics are - are very simple. It's, er, "Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." The Doctor and I will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  Doctor, if you please.
What do you mean?
Why didn't you tell me this before?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
Sybok possessed the keenest intellect I have ever known.
The emergency channel, open.
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
Your vision?
You are mad!



Tried to.  Can't quite make the connection with that sucker, though. If I had a direct terminal ...
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Oh, I wish you'd forget about that. It was all so long ago. I've totally gotten over it.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
They'll start to soon enough.
No...
I'm afraid so. I spotted him this time and kicked him out, but he's getting trickier all the time.
Cute.
When you've been in the system as long as I have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...
All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
Tron...?
Swell...I'll log us both on, and you can get your Tron thing running...
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
We have to get off this beam!
Girlfriend, you got a man.  You				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
No you're not.  You're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
I have a book report.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
Roger, One.  Rolling.
It's Talkradio.  You're on the air.
She knows not to steal.  I've taught her better than that.
Don't be ridiculous.  She's only -- how old is she?
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
I'll just hang then, shall I?
Something to do with Helen, is what I'm getting.
It can't be.  Not Helen.
GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!
You tell on me, I tell on you.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Sorry.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
There is no us, you psychotic bitch.
They must've just missed me.
They said you had to run out.
I can't, honey.  I promised Allison I'd go shopping with her. Sorry.
Why?
Yes or no.
You will be contacted with the assignment.
I think so.
Yup.										*
So what's your angle?
Sure.  Set me up and then don't tell me.
Isn't that hard to keep up, in the long run?
No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
No, you don't understand, we've been married for 15 years--
Hold that thought.
It's my job to risk my life, but not yours.  I feel bad about bringing you into this, but you're the only one I can trust.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
And you chased one?
Helen, I want you to be my wife.
I don't know.  I have to think...
Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
His wife?  Good.  Bring them.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Who?
Uh-huh.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
You don't know him -
Is this a joke?
... was so romantic.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
How come?
Cancoon.
That rhymes.
Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang.
Naw naw!
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
You got it.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
Elliot.
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
The police department?
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
What makes you think I would do that?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
No.
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice.
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Absolutely.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
You're no longer an extra -
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
- Because it's good!
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
What can I do?
Yeah, I live here.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Well, you go down Beechwood...
I didn't mean -
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
You've been in an institution, haven't you, James?  A hospital?
I have to go.
What year do you think it is?
1995?
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
What will you do...when you find this...secret army?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Uh, no.  Yes.  I mean, just some scrapes...
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
I remember you...like this.  I feel I've known you before.  I feel I've always known you.
I need to make a telephone call.
That would be totally out of character. Helping people is against my principles.  See, he definitely doesn't know me.  Now, I'm going to go back and listen to my father's very eloquent discourse on the perils of science WHILE YOU TORTURE THIS INTRUDER TO DEATH.
Cole!  Oh, God, Cole, where are we?
Were you listening?  We got two officers in the hospital.  Yeah, he's in restraints, plus the medic gave him enough stellazine to kill a horse.  Look at him!  Still on his feet.
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
I'll be right here...just in case.
You can't do that yourself?
Hell no, I can't do that myself. I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Maybe I do.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
You don't fear death?
More or less.
I need a ticket.
I'll give you the money!  Okay? I'll give you two-fifty.  Just . . . just, please.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Ninety-two.  Only gonna get hotter. I remember one time . . .
Just a car.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
You've been there?
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
I want my car.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Let me have a Beck's.
Kirin?
No.  We got Miller.  Regular Miller. You want it, or don't you?
Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
Can't I?  You're out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  What do you think, boy?
John--
They look nice.
There's someone in the house.
Jake.  No.  No!
That's right on my way.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
That's all right.  I got it.
What happens if you lose?
I guess it must.
What?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
No.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
You could just leave him.
Whatever it takes.
Is it pretty?
Take me with you.
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
How much money has he got?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
What about us?
This is good.  This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
We're going all the way.  Together.
No.
What about him?
Damn you!  What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Not me.  Us.
I think I busted my leg.
And you're not one to lie, are you?
I'm her husband.
I'm a solid man.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Would you kill her?
Hungry?
No.
I'm surprised to see you.  I thought you'd be halfway to Vegas by now.
I was hoping we could talk.
The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Do we shake hands?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife . . .?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You didn't kill her?
You think that's a lot of money?
Trouble with the car again?
Fifty dollars more.  That's a lot of money when you don't have a dime. And where'd you plan on getting the money from?  Maybe you thought you'd pay your friend Jake McKenna a visit.
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
Yeah, well, a couple of hours ago I just about killed some guy over a girl.  Not for money, for a girl. And she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  Same way Grace played us this morning.  I don't like that, Jake.  Not twice in one day.  And maybe I'm so pissed I'd twist the next off my own Grandma to get out of here.
Damn it, Jake.  If I don't get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  And if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two- hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. But I need the money.  I've got to have the money.
Come on, Jake--
Christ, Jake, please--
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over.  Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
Let me guess.  This robber; he gets your money.
The old lady?
A hundred-forty-five really.
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Sure, Sheriff.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
I didn't do anything.
Sure you do.  Everybody in town knows about the money Jake kept hid in the house.  It's a wonder the Mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  Not for lack of trying.
Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst.
Christ!
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. And everything is everything.
Your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
You afraid of the dark?
More or less.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt.  All right.  Let's do this.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Accident.
You've got to be--
I'm a solid man.
Bobby Cooper.
I hope so.  Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Would I what?
About what you said this morning.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
You love her, but you hate her?
I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
How do you want it?
Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be...
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
I've had time to get over it.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Great!
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Ninety-two.  Course half hour from now might be seventy-two. These clouds move around a lot.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Hundred-fifty.
You've been there?
What?
Yeah, but it was shot.
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
No.
Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it.
Eh?
That's right on my way.
I got it.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
I didn't say it bothered me.
Thank you.
What?
Lift me down.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way.
Try me.
Oh yeah. It's beautiful, beautiful beaches. Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
I don't give a damn about the money.  I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
What the hell? Why not? Where should we go?
Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
<u>I don't know why</u>!
Can you make it back up?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
"Arkady"
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
I ... Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
Beck's.
More like Jenny is after every man she sees.
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
Stay out of this, Jenny.  We got man's business to take care of. I ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
Vat? I am going 5 miles an hour! I am looking town. I not even moving.
I want my lawyer!
I know.
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
My turn.  When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
Think carefully?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
You've misunderstood.
The guy might not have been carrying anything.
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I'm not scared.
Jeremy listen to what--
This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
On a bench, across the street.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
On account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
'Course he's coming.
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
Your wife?
Little Bill, I thought you were dead. I see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
Oh.
Oh yeah.
Alive?
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
You could run off them two cowboys.
Nope. They'll stay out on the Spade country where they got friends.
There ain't no snakes in here, Mister Hendershot.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Jesus!
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Lookin' at?
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
He got the boy's horse.
Yeah.
Yup.
First one I ever killed.
How I said I shot five men... it wasn't true.  That Mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... I busted his leg with a shovel... I didn't shoot him or nothin'.
Lemmee see it.
We'll come across him tomorra, I guess.
I ain't the same, Ned. Claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. Us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean I'm back to like I was. I just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  Remember that drover, the one I shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? I dream about him now an' again. I didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one I could remember when I sobered up.
Naw. I bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
You're marking us, Bill.
HEY KID, IT'S ME, BILL MUNNY.
Yeah... you said that last night.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Who, Bill? Who got snake eyes?
I ain't waitin', Bill.  I'll look in on your youngsters when I get back.
The one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
I'm a damn good shot.  See that hawk up there? I could kill that hawk with one shot.
He's blind, for Chri...
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
We done that stuff.
We'll bury him.
Hell, yeah.
You can stop looking. There was no coke. I've been in L.A. county with a guy they
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
A hijacker like Dean, here? Or something more creative?
Do your friend a favor, Fenster, keep him quiet .
I had a guy's fingers in my asshole tonight.
His name is Verbal Kint. I thought you guys knew him.
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
They're gonna do a job. Three million dollars, maybe more.
If you'll just let me -
Hurt you, you sonofabitch? I could kill you.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Three million?
Maybe more.
Hungarian?
I want you to find Edie. Both of you find some place safe. Tell her what happened - Everything. She knows people. She'll know what to do. If we can't get Kobayashi my way, she'll get him her way.
Edie Finneran. She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition. I requested she be put on the case personally. She flew out yesterday.
Business or personal?
Tell him we'll meet.
Where?
He was a corrupt cop, Verbal.
That's been suppressed. Anything in there is inadmissible.
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer, Verbal?
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
NOT FROM ME, YOU PIECE OF SHIT. THERE IS NO IMMUNITY FROM ME. You atone with me or the world you live in becomes the hell you fear in the back of your tiny mind. Every criminal I have put in prison,
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
Wait a minute.
He wanted me to live.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Nothing.
Yes.  It would be.
And no one will know the truth.
When she...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
Ms. Nevins, nurse-anesthetist; Dr.Marx, of course...
My God, we tried to save her...You can't know...You can't know...
Are you board-certified in anesthesiology, Doctor?
No.
I'm just an M.D.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Yes.
Now.  I'd like to ask you something: four years ago, when you were working as a nurse, are you aware that Drs. Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed . . . ?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
... that's all right.
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance...she...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
It was good of you to meet...
...I made a reservation at...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Yes.  I wrote it.
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
What are they going to do?  Not invite me to their Birthday party ...?   Look, I gotta go.  I have to be in Cambridge ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
No.
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I was held up.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar.  Representing my client. My client, do you understand?  You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
You aren't going to get a mistrial, boy.  We're going back this afternoon, we're going to try this case to an end.  Now you get out of here before I call the Bailiff and have you thrown in jail.
Exception!
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
Let me talk to Mickey.
We have a renew-your-subscription offer...
No.  At Chelsea Childcare.  Okay. Look, call me Monday, hey?  I'm late for work.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Yes.  It was, actually.
My name's Frank.  And furthermore, you came back to see me tonight.
You're going to stay here...?
Yes.
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
Yes.
Well, then what are you doing here?
If I don't 'grow up...'
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
No.
... I get these people to trust you --they're coming here tomorrow by the way --I get this expert doctor to talk to you.  I'm doing all your fuckin' legwork -- and it's eighteen months.  You're 'sposed to be in court.  I bet you haven't even seen the file.
What do you want?
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
What?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Right.
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
D'you meet with Dr. Gruber...?
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
The Hospital...?
... I know.  I went ...
Yes.  Yes, I have.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
Mrs...
That's a wonderful profession.  My daughter-in-law's a nurse.  What did you do, stop?
Thanks, Franky.
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Yes.
Yes.
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.   Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
I married into it.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
No, I'm all right.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Then?
Where'd she go?
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
I -- I --
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
She... went into the Bay.
Who you are --
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
They're none of them right.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Is that the best you can do?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
I don't know... Switzerland?
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Where were you?
Wandering about.
No.
I... didn't know where you lived.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Some people prefer it.
You've nothing to apologize for.
Ah.  That's what I was going to do.
Only silence. It's always like this.
Have you been here before?
No!
Vaguely...
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
How do you know?
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
No!
All the time.
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
You can't.
Madeleine!!
Please answer my question.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  Ah, tomorrow!
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Normal.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
I think I can lick it.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
And she died...
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
Carlotta?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Yeah.
What I've been doing?
By whom?
Bullshit it's not accesory. I didn't do shit. You call the cops, you explain it was an accident...
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
What's that?
You're an asshole.
Oh, and why am I an asshole?
You're pathetic.
You're not a team player.
The hell I don't.
You go home!
I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house. Took care of that one, didn't I?  Prison Communications.
You don't know what you're doing.
What are you doing?
Her head's bashed in and her heart isn't beating.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
Sure, why not.
So I didn't fucking do it!
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
So that's what we're doing.
Don't talk to me about character.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
Don't ever stare him down.
It has to be done.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
Not tonight.
Left side.
Give me two more.
We need padded chairs.
Good God...Good God...
I think we should say some words over the grave.
What kind of words?
No, but she's definitely pissed and hostile. And she's clearly starting to think that's something's not right.
Suck my ass.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
Okay fine.
I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up all night in the rain, in stormy gale force wind, tornado and fucking earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I stay lit. I don't go dark. I never go dark!
The hell I did!
Israel doesn't have a King.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What's your point?
Take Mexico.
That's what I'm saying. Let the Israelis straighten it up. They got plenty of room down there, number one. Plus, and this is just a plus, they kind of look alike - the Jews and the Mexicans. So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gonna have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing. Am I right?
Ball park sausages.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
I love you.
Government cutbacks.
Why can't we do it through the mail?
Florist?
Why what?
Charles Moore for instants.
You will not be common!!!
You go down there.
Do you love me?
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
I'm mad at you.
I'm working on it.
Can we just talk this out?
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
But...
What does that mean?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
No...
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
Buzzing?
Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just chipping away in the back of my skull.
The sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter...and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect. Perfect. It would only last a second, but that second was it. It was it. That's what dad had us looking for...You get me?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
That's our plan.
Drum banging real times.
Then it's a respectable house.
What about them?
Was that difficult to get?
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
Thank you, Uncle.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. How far are you prepared to help me?
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
I didn't want to do it, Don Jorge. They made me ...
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I'm bored. I'm alone all day and I don't know what to do.
Where's the dough?
Why?
Are you Jorge?
It's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
She's left.
And let him get run over by somebody else?
A black bull!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Yes!
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
That's enough.  Go join the others, and don't come back here.  And you'll have to control your temper.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
Me? What did I do?
Why wasn't I told?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
I understand... I understand perfectly.
It's nanotechnology, isn't it? Machines the size of molecules...
Separate the character module from the neural net...
What's wrong with Parker?
What do you expect me to do, put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here?
I think I understand what you have in mind...
It wasn't a lie.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Who said that?
Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag for over a week. Kept it in his locker while he was at work in a candy factory.  We need to get a look at Sid 6.7's final profile.
She's beautiful, you know?
You know, considering you've only been out of prison for seven hours, you're readapting quite well.  Wait, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I meant...
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
Think he's keeping track of his creation?
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
That's why I'm asking.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I've got some final preparations to take care of Checking his watch, he stops suddenly.
I really did think I was still in reality. At least, until now.  Beam me up, Scotty!
BARNES, YOU'RE DEAD!
As long as they keep overpaying me, I'll keep overpaying you.  ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month.
<u>Lure</u> him. 
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  It's true, right?
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
Oh, Lord....
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
And you?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'm working on it.
<u>Hello</u>... Yes.  We'll be back...?
Tonight.  Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Get on this, right now...
<u>Nashville</u>...?
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
Oh.  Hell.  And what do we do now?  What do we do <u>now</u>? Boy Producer?  Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, <u>Whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik.  Commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
How do we explain <u>that</u>?
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
ON THE PRESSCORP, THE REPORTERS, LISTENING WIDEMOUTHED, TO THE PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
And I can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can only say,
We're locked into Albania.
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
I have.
Dartmouth
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
That's from the ... it's got to be from the...
Why Albania?
Hell, I'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
We don't need an Act Two.
...it's a Teaser!
It's a teaser, absolutely right,
The men and women of Detachment Three-O-Three, with their...
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR.

Where is he now?
What do you mean he won't do it?  He won't do <u>what</u>?  He won't do the sp...  It's what?  It's <u>corny</u>?  <u>Corny</u>?  Is that the word?  Of <u>course</u> it's corny.

All the greater accomplishment.
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  No. Lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...

Is today Laundry Day...?
No, I think..
They don't know what's going on!
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
...takes years of genetics, pal, and a Yale education... and the right tailor.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Marv,  ...I just bagged the elephant!
...Work okay?
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
What do I need a fancy suit for. I don't hobnob with the jet set. I just fix their planes.
...have a nice day Mr. Stone.  ... Mr. Gekko, the conference call is ready. Mr. Sugarman and Mr. Lorenzo in Delaware. Mr. Bernard in Los Angeles. Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rosco in London. They're all on.
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
I got this guy who should know tells me buy Hewlitt Packard but I been burned on tips. What do you think Bud?
Okay.
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
...Can't it wait? I'm good for it.  ...Awright. Come out, get the directions from Natalie and hurry up.
Dump it.
You sandbagged me on Bluestar.  I guess you think you taught the teacher a lesson, that you can make the tail wag the dog, huh?
Grand Marnier. A romantic and tragic drink.
You could have a great beach house for that.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon.  but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
It's not me I'm worried about...You know Darien, the only reason we haven't slept together is because we both know we will -- and not knowing when was the only surprise left. You owe me, I want you, what else is there...but you, me, the world.  ...right here...make love to me...now...  Stop me if I'm going too far.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
There came into Egypt a Pharoah who did not know.
...that "scum" built this company up from one plane in thirty years, they made something out of nothing, and if that's a scum I'll take one over a rat any day...
I can't...and I won't.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
Suffer?  We're living in America.
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Hi
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Jenkins!
A party at a waxwork huh?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
No I'm serious.  It's. it's just I don't know I. I'm looking for something else.
Listen Sarah, I think I know what's going on ok.  I went to the waxwork today.I met this man.
Well.   .this, is Mr. Lincoln.  And that's the man I saw at the waxwork.
Right behind you.
Sell my soul?
Doing what? SIR WILFRED Tipping the scales.  Ruining that delicate balance between good and evil.  I think  that our Mr. Lincoln has found a very effective way of doing it.  There's a  voodoo belief that by making a wax effigy of an evil being, containing a  belonging of his he possessed in earthly form, and feeding him the soul of a  believing victim, you can bring him back to life!
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Come on Mark MARK Ah hell, why not.  I'll get the maid to write the essays
I'll come back all the time.
Of course you will.
Try to communicate with her somehow.
Nope.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
At the party.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Who's that?
I'm running late here.  I just came back for my briefcase.
When...when will she be back?
Oh-kay...
Um...yes.
That's not...It's not like that.
I know.  And I'm sorry.  I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
Thank you.
She never mentioned her father.
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
Stop.
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Adamant?
That could take days.  I need to do something now.  Don't you see?  She wants us dead.
Don't.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
You are...
You're kidding.
"...especially Spencer's Theorem..."
That's...
Didn't know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
Five minutes?
I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
What can it hurt to talk to someone?
What are you...?  No.
The accident...?
But then you've been so much better...
It was maybe a week after the accident. We were moving.  It was a hard time.
STOP IT!
Who?
What?
Claire--
That's not what I'm sayi--
...would do anything just to be around me.  And I slipped.  God help me, I slipped.
It's alright.
Don't think so.
Nothing.
I did NOT!  I did not kill anyone.  Jesus. Claire, listen to me.  I walked in and she was lying there dead.  I swear to you.  On my life!  She took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  To destroy us!  If I hadn't stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
Shhhh.
:What do you mean "They" are? Are you officially a woman now?
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
When is the funeral...?   I am coming to my mother's funeral!!
I'm tired.  I need to rest.
ENOUGH!!!
The door, Michael.  find the key...
Lie...?
Only you...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
How is your heart, Father...? Is the Timex still ticking...?
Like this...  LIKE THIS...?
Nothing.  Absolutely nothing-
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
Just sit there and soak up the vitamin D.
Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
Stop it.
But it scares the hell out of you, doesn't it. Michael...?
Hello..
Maybe he's just - waiting...
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
That's cause we're below sea level.
- we made a fire.
Your beneficence.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Go ahead.
Gotcha.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
And it can't be forged?
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
All the time?
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I'm a dentist
I don't know
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
I have something I have to show you...
STEPHANIE?
I am ashamed of what I have done ELLEN. When I read what you had written it made me think - look into myself - I haven't dared look into myself for a long time - I have stopped ELLEN, I can't carry on - I won't carry on. All I want is to start a new life - I want a second chance...You are good to me - you don't condescend, you're intelligent, and very beautiful...
Yes - I suppose so...
He saved my life you know - has he told you...
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
Who said anything about surgery...It'll only take a moment.
I better go, Dad.
Check it out!
How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties?
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
You go first.
Well. The prom's coming up.
Yeah?
Yeah? You like?
You have changed since second grade.
Oh, Teddy Bear, you're funny.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Watch your tone, mister.
Want a lesson?
I know.  I'm Ginger. Miss April.
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
I guess...I don't know...I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now.
Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history.
I understand.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
It's really late...do your parents know where you are?
I meant biologically.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I don't get the distinction.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
Funny you should say "peachy."
My adoptive grandfather. Who knows what my biological grandfather did.
He phoned it in.
You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball?
I mean my father.
A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad.
It's incredibly simple.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
There's gotta be something. We have to dig deeper.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
Rules are rules.
I'm warning you.
I have only one concern...
Yeah.  Everything's cool.
They said that? Really?  Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that.
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
I understand.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
No.
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
You got it.  The rich got richer.  While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
It's Homicide's job now, Ray, let 'em do it.  I'll tell you something else, there's more to this story than you know, Ray... If Suzie is dead, I think Hunter may be on the right track...
Why is that?
And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
Yes.
I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't...
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
Your Honor... Please...
Yeah.  But I got my bike.
You can trust me.
I've been a cop for a while, Kelly.  It's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  And then there's the love angle.  I mean do you and Sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
Police -- God -- get a life.
Sam!  Hi!
I won't.
Jeez, that thing... Can't you...
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
Lady has some deep pockets.  That's all I'm saying.
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Yes.
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
No.
Didn't you see her this morning?
I don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
If you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then I for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
Then why kidnap them?  Why not just kill them?
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
What about the explosive?
Limestone quarry, Southern mansion. Easy to get them mixed up... I say we invite ourselves to the party.
Prepare what?
I was six.  And ever since, my policy is: Act first and worry later.
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
A cylinder recorder.  My own design.
It's not a guy...
Of course not.
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
What is this?  A whole new train?
Thank you.  But the truth is, I'm a single woman in a man's world. That leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
Oh, I would hope not.
You bring the best out in a man.
Well, yes sir.  A Professor Morton, but with just a little more time, sir, I can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
That'll be all, boys.
Part of some speech they wrote for this trip I'm taking.
And?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Really?  Must be a dangerous business.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Call it what you like.  The point is, I was heir to that land, Mr. West.  It belonged to my beloved grandmother!  Now I intend to have it back.  My own country!
So, I'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an Emperor and a murderer?
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
Not today, Willow.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
Say what?
Good.  How long will it take?
Peck!  Quick!  Douse the fire!
I will.
Then I will teach you.
Shhhhh!
Now use it.
Just do it!
Surrender!!
Courage, Willow.
Who is he?
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
The sorceress.
Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Tell you what  I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
...I want to say a thing.
Have you got your gun on now?
You know who?
We do not go into your courts.
I would not be too sure.
Because  somehow  they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
I was wrong.
But you can't.
You tell him. When you're able.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
But Stoltzfus said...
Make that 1790.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Yes.
Oh.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
Yes, darling.
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
Yes, let the joyous news be spread.
Do you presume to criticize the....
No, I'm afraid it's true. There's no other Wizard except me.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
I'm sorry.  I didn't do it!  Can I still have my dog?
No, I'm afraid I didn't.
It's always best to start at the beginning -- and all you do is follow the Yellow Brick Road.
Why --
Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
Oh -- yes.
I said it had poppies on the wall paper! Eh -- she's -- What's this?  Why, she's -- she's putting her hand on her heart -- she's -- she's dropping down on the....
Stop her!
Oh...
Oh --!
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Oh! Oh!
Oh, see - I killed it. Oh, I killed that poor little honey bee!
Oh, my!
Lions and tigers and bears!
Well, you didn't have to go and hit me, did you?  Is my nose bleeding?
Not nobody, not nohow!
I'd sooner wait outside.
Oh, come on.
Ohhh!
Well, your head ain't made of straw, you know.
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohh!
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
I don't blame you for that.
Yes. Dorothy -- ah -- Dor --
Here --   Come on.
And you're going to lead us.
Imposserous!
Hold still - hold still --
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Yeah.
Not nohow!
Ohhhh -- it's me!
We do.
Some -- but mostly lions, and tigers, and bears.
A heart --
I don't think I could, but we could try.
What would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
I took the initiative.
The doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, hes a dead man.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
The worm on the hook again.
Who did you get it from?
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
Shell get over it.
Im sorry.
Its the only way out...
A little. Does it matter? After all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  Isnt that right, Elektra? Isnt that your motto?
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
I dont know what youre talking about!
BondJamesBond. What brings you here?
Bond, Im a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal familys, now its mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble...
A rope!
Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Who?  Bond?  Bond is dead.
How would you know?
I would like to use the bathroom --
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
God isn't there to do it.
Yes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me you're sleeping with Dreiberg.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
I explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
He pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an elevator shaft.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
His . . . whatever.
I don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide it?
What are you up to?
Oh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
My God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and he stops to take a --
Will you two lovebirds keep it down?
Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
With lots of ketchup?
My dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better than ever.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Laurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed the world.
What about you?
You're making a big --
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
Alright, Cage, you've got me. This is one of those moments. "Many are called, few are chosen", that kind of thing. Your government needs you. Are you up for the challenge?
That's too bad. I thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.
What do I get out of it?
Jesus Christ, Gibbons, this is something we came up with?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
You've kept up your end of the bargain, I'll do the same. But you really should consider staying on, you make a decent agent.
We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it.
But programmable. And expendable.
What do you get if you finish?
He gets to be the hero.
I also remember you drove your car here. Who are you really? Make no mistake, I will shoot you and not feel bad about it. Who are you working for?
Look at you. You're helping run things now. You're a gangster. I bet that snuck up on you. You woke up one day and you were a criminal.
I know where he's coming from. The only thing I really don't get is why he dumped you. Up until I found that out, I thought his judgment was pretty sound.
All I have to do is risk my life providing you with these facts.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
There's something I didn't have time to tell you before.
Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here.
I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
Use your grenades! Maybe we can blow it up underwater!
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
That's would be me.
I'm through, Xander.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I?
He's a pretty good actor, though.
He flashed his badge to half the bar when he bought his drink.
Had to do what I had to do.
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss.
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Beast.
I don't like him being here.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Shut up.  I got no interest in you, Xavier,  or your... X-Men.
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
You think I care about her?  I'm the only one who's sure to walk out of here.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
ALIVE.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
I know.
You have the wrong house.
Victor Frankenstein.
Are you trying to make me look like an idiot?
He has a big mouth.  Yes!  It seems to me I did read something about that incident as a student.  But you have to remember that a worm -- with very few exceptions -- is not a human being.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
I have taken an oath that each letter of this testament shall be executed...and by God, it shall be done!
MMMMM!  MMMMM!
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
MMmmm.
Miss me?
Surprised!
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
I suppose you're right.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Saturday night, yes, sir.  Have a pleasant journey!
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
Well sir... I'm not sure I understand the distinction between 'Reflexive' and 'Voluntary' nerve impulses.
A piece of what?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
It's not.  It's Fredereck Fronkonsteen.
What wockers?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
What?
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
Maybe...if you get here on time.
That's what we're paid for.
Come on, Froderick -- none of that.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
There's only one way.
For  God's sake -- go on!  Are you trying to make me look like a fool. Sing, you amateur!  Sing!!
Well...
Perhaps we'd better leave.
And look at this, Doctor!
Alive!  Look at it.  I have defeated death!
Me?  Sing?
I think so.
I know Frederick.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I will.
MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
Whew!  A nineteen-inch drill.
Three minutes to go!
Yes.
Igor -- the clock!  Hurry!
Tell what you see. Write it well, Sir, and make sure you get it right
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off- to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust
Yes.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Um. There are rumours that my Lord Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.
Which one?

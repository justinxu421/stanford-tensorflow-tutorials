Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
No...
What crap?
Let's go.
No.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
What do you think?
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
You did what?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
It's just you.
Just for a minute
Why?
The prom?  Kat has a date?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
How many people were in your old school?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Her favorite uncle
Don't make me do it, man
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
They're running the rest of me next month.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
What?
We're not.
William didn't even go to high school
Does it matter?
Who cares?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.

That's what you want, isn't it?
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
You don't care if I die
Who?
I thought you were above all that
What?
Why'd you lie?
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Maybe.
Good call.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
You tell me.
Answer the question, Patrick
Is that right?
Because I like to torture you.
You decided.
Then tell them I had a seizure.
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
Just smack her now.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Yeah...
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
Dr. Ruth?
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
Naturally.  But I would really deplore the loss of such a potential opportunity for Spain for a... dispute over a point of geography.
That's something you can't decide.
You don't usually ask.
Bartolome and Giacomo Colon.
This time with me!
... and also to bring medicine.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I am not sure... It could be twice the distance.
Give me absolution.
The Indians have no such word, Don Moxica.
You bloody...
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
You bring the cigarettes?
What's your cut?  How much?
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
If you cooperate with the DA - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
What are you asking me?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone...
I'll get my clothes.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
No, what is it?
You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Raw deal.
Yeah.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Just a shower?
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright?
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you?
Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me.
My father was.  He gave me many lessons about fire.  Now it's my friend.
Let her go!  Let her go!!
Yes.
How long are you planning to stay?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
You said speak Czech!
Sit down!
Bad last moment - I cut it out.
Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
Credit?
No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action!
Ha. Ha.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
How did you start the fire this time?
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here.
Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents.
Don't you get it?  He knew he was gonna get caught!  That's why he videotaped Eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor.
I'm afraid I've only got a few minutes, but I'd love to.
What's up?
Yes.
I guess it isn't.
Still, all we have to do is ask Hal.
Yes, but it's more likely that the tolerances on our testing gear are too low.
Well, I hope there's nothing wrong with the assembly on those. Other- wise we're out of business.
And don't you worry about it.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
Three, darling. One... two ... three. Be sure to tell Mommy I called.
Thank you.
Well, how's it going back there?
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Yes, it's coming along very well.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
When do we arrive at Clavius?
Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken wonderful care of me. I'm just fine.
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
Thank you very much, Hal.
Let me see the tracking alignment display.
Hammond.
Here's hoping, baby...
I used to go with him...I don't know where the hell he is.  I haven't seen him for two weeks. And I don't think I will.  He owes me money...
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
Sure, anything you want.
You're crazy.
It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I may call you worse than that.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers... They move off down the corridor.
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies would like to go a few laps with us.  How about it? I been nearly three years in prison and...
Luther knew more than he told me and so do you...Now you better tell we what the fuck this is all about.  I gave you 48 hours to come up with something and the clock's runnin' ...
You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Guess what?  Luther just got in line.
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
That ain't philosophy.  That's common sense.
You got a very depressing view of life, man... you gotta smile once in awhile...
Yeah, it doesn't look like he's gonna make it as a dangerous tough guy...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
No way...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Hello. And goodbye.
I don't know about you, but I could use a drink... I'll buy you one.  It'll be my good-bye present.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
I'll keep it in mind.
They ran.  As fast as they could. Caught a train.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I dunno ... he's gonna call me...
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Call me later.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Fuck you.
Hot?  Hey, they're not even room temperature.
We got a lot to talk about.
Sure, right.
You want that Indian to snap her neck?
What are you talkin' about? I said I wouldn't hurt her.
Naw, right here's okay.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
We have to save the world.
Good luck..
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
How do I look?
How many points you got left on your license?
Leeloo..
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
Where have I heard this song before?
You get that off the screen?
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I want to sleep... forever...
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
Uh..
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Your clothing reeks of it.
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
What's going on, Tom?  What happened?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
Tom... she's dead.
What you see is what I got, mister.
Bullshit.
Blow me, you paranoid fuck, that's impossible.  Why are you bothering me with this... ?
There's nothing there, you brain- dead cunt.  Think about it.  There's absolutely no way in this world to connect us to anything.  I want you to hang the phone up, and if you call me about this again I'm going to send a friend of mine out there and have him crack you open with a fucking rib spreader.
Hmm.
There are reasons for the way we do things here.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
It's good what you're doing.
Yeah.
How much did he pay you?
Fuck you then, you want to know?  I talked her up, told her how beautiful she was, told her she was gonna be a star.  I told her I was gonna get her a screen test, and while I'm doing that, I got her a soda and dropped a mickey.  When it was dark enough, I rang Dino and told him it was go time, I put her in the trunk of my car and we went and we fucking did it.  That's what happened.  She's dead.  She's been dead a long fucking time.  Nobody fucking cares!
You enjoy it?
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Well, whatever reasons Mrs. Christian has for engaging the services of a private investigator, I should certainly be a party to. But, since she feels differently, I can only go on the record as having expressed my adamant disapproval.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
You'll get it when we get there.
Yeah... guess so.
Max.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
He cuts all kinds of other stuff into his movies; photographs, newsreel footage, subliminal images. Thinks he's making art.
It's money.  People use it to purchase goods and services.
I try to be.
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I told you I can't, not yet.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
You told me to look, so I looked.
Fine...
If there's anything you feel uncomfortable talking about, tell me, but I have to ask.  Your husband... he committed suicide?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
There wasn't anything like that. The police and the FBI people asked, but there wasn't anything happened like that, never.  My husband... his heart broke when Mary left...
No one knows what it's like.  You can't even imagine how much it hurts.
Okay.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
They brought her into the room... one man, he put a knife to her throat and he raped her...
He raped her and...and...and he murdered her...he cut her up with knifes...
She was the kindest, sweetest girl you'd ever want to meet.  Oh, I adored her.  I supposed I always hoped she'd be back.  After a time, all I could do was pray she had moved on to better things.  Can you get this suitcase to her parents, if you think it's appropriate?
Yes, Mister Welles, thank you.
Certainly, sir.
Look, you gotta stand up for yourself. Learn to fight back.
It was bad.
Doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
"In her dream"?
Who?
It was Freddy.
Enough of that crap.
What else?  You ever look over this town's history?  Not a safe place to be a teenager.  Anyway, if I'm next, watch your back.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
It's no story.  It happened.  Freddy's real and he's back.
It's okay, Dan
Huh?
My name is...
Been having bad dreams.
My friend, with the funny hand.
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
I know.
You're right.
Me too.
It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
Meaning?
You know my mother -- get real.  What about Alice's?
He invited me to his house last night.
My father!  He's not - ?
Then...this is a 'flying saucer?'
So?
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Somewhere down there?
We'll have to look for them later.
Right at our one-eyed friend!
Sidearms?  But the saucer's dead.
Something wrong?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
Wonderful!
We can <u>ram</u> him!
Come where?
I am afraid not.  Therefore -
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Chub says you're fired.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You take care of your end, kid, I'll take care of mine.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game. I was just wondering, that's all. What'd he do, to shoot himself, I mean?
Sure you did.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
I called Mommy.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It's pretty old.
Pop?
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
I figured you already heard.
Like hell.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You and Mel Gordon?
Yeah, you can have the key. It's the key that's kept me locked to you all these years. I give it to you with pleasure.  Now I'm free. See how easy it is, Jack? All you got to do is give back what the man gave you, and you're free of him.  I've got to call my brother.
It's just...
Hi honey.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Is...? She's dead then?
How's that?
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Well, I guess -- that's what he said.
Call it what you want.
Crawl!
No, not tonight. I'm in bed too. I'm calling because I need you to listen. You're supposed to be a smart guy. You're a professor. I got this theory. Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot but he did.
You think Jack shot him?
Then who shot him?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
Shit, around here, you shoot somebody in the woods, you say it was an accident, you get fined fifty bucks and your hunting license lifted. Jack's probably saying the guy shot himself cause he ain't got his deer yet and don't want his license pulled.
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
I'm sure he's busy.
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
Big secret.  You said the same thing to Newsweek.
No, thank you. The gunfire did that.
That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
It's okay, honey. I got you. I got you. You're okay.
Holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you're making demands.
This doesn't make sense.
That's game, set, and match. There's nothing to do, except call the Chief Justice.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Maria... Maria Mitchell.
You're very valuable. And our nation needs so many things.
Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
Hold on, Alice.
Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... Lee, go huddle with the D.O.D. I want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
Tell our boys to cool their jets. I don't need `em creating policy for me.
That isn't necessary.
Can't it wait?
She's a big girl.  She understands.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the....
I might still have a few chips left.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Sir?
Te...!
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Roger.
Simon, what are you saying?!
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's okay, ROK.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
He's carrying a bomb.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
But if you'll just give me...
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
Every day.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
I'm Randy.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Yes...
Nothing?
Did you talk to him?
Yeah, sure.  I knew that...
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
Yeah, that's it.  Say it slow.
When will Strader return?
Sticking out of his ass... yeah! See, that's what makes it a joke. There's like a surprise, and your mind fills in the funny picture. Here's this guy with a pen stuck in his ass and he thinks it's a thermometer.  Nada, huh?
Please, I must get out here.
Come on, you won't have to get near the water.
Thank you.
Warren Hubley was in middle management at a refinery... Joshua Strader operated a successful bar and nightclub...
... It is called ss'jabroka'.  To us it is a potent narcotic.
We?  You've taken it?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
It'd be for your own good.  I think you'd be better off with a partner who's a little more... by the book.  ... Still, I gotta tell you, George, for a quiet guy, you're sure hell on wheels once you get going.  I'd kinda hate to miss your next two days as a detective.
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Position?
What?
All right.  Let's get on it.  What'll you need?
Well, thanks, I --
They had their minds made up before I even went in there. They think I'm a head case.
That's the plan.  My word on it.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
Corporal Hicks!?
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
But they don't know that.  They're probably looking for other ways to get in.  That'll take them awhile.
We didn't miss anything.
Stand back.
No.  Have you?
Oh, God.  Jesus.  This ain't happening.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
How long have I been on Gateway station?
You promise?
No, it's different, honey.
I'll be right in the other room, Newt.  And look...I can see you on that camera right up there.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
What do you mean?
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Is there a part for me?
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Oh!
What did you think of the music?
No, she's fine.
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
I want to go!
Do you think that's funny?
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
No!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
Shut up! Just shut up! I don't need them.
Oh, damn!
Stanzi!
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Madame. How can I help you?
I understand.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Yes.
What for?
Ah. Well. Ah,  I see you've got your manager with you. Well, Madame, how about half the receipts?
I hope so. I need it immediately.
Oh, yes.
Behold!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
Wine?
You are cattivo, Court Composer.  I want to meet this young man. Chamberlain, arrange a pleasant welcome for him.
It's just a trifle, of course.
Majesty, I did. Believe me, it was a most agonizing. decision. But finally, I simply could not recommend Herr Mozart.
I have to tell you, Mozart is not entirely to be trusted alone with young ladies.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Oh sir, yes! The honour is mine. Absolutely.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
It's actually quite amusing, Majesty. It's set - the  whole thing is set in a - in a -
Yes, indeed.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Thank you, Sire!
Yet we hear you are making an opera from it. Is this true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
Your Majesty, Herr Mozart -
I don't know. Stanzi? Stanzi!
Pupils?
Of course not. You're a good girl. You're very kind to do this. Next time you're sure they'll be out of the house, let me know, will you?
In there, sir.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
So there you are. What do you say?
No.
Why not?
Because there's nothing to see.
Well, we can.
Strudel, this is Herr Mozart. Say good morning.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
Well, this is hardly the way to go about it.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
But what is it they don't like?
Grazie, a lei, Signor Antonio!
How could it not, Excellency?
You mean she's not coming back?
Consigned to flames of woe.
Common time.
I think so.
With the tenors.
Do you have it?
Then let me hear it. All of it. The whole thing from the beginning - now!
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I'm not leaving you.
What for?
It is dangerous for you to interpret His Majesty's edicts. Give me your score, please.
Oh yes, certainly. Certainly, Herr Director!
Mozart -
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
So?
Leave me alone.
Here in Vienna.
I didn't. That was Mozart. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. You know who that is?
Every day. Sometimes for hours I would pray!
You cannot say that!
The only thing that worried me was the actual killing. How does one do that? How does one kill a man? It's one thing to dream about it. It's very different when you have to do it, with your own hands.
You must be mad.
The Emperor has given him permission.
Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Thank you.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
What happened to them?
Yes.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Yes.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
No, why?
No, not really.
No, a cab will be faster.
David?
A wolf.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
How is that?
I dream of death mostly.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
Twenty-eight.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Yes?
I was awake and he was in my room.
Anything.
A doper werewolf.
The zoo?
Don't you remember?
Will you shut up!?!!
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Why on earth do you say that?
No, but we're about to.
Where am I?
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
I really don't know.
You're talking about the woman I love.
That's a wolf's head.
Nice to see you.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Wrong.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Thanks a lot.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
What?!
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Yeah - sure!
It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
Yes, sir.
And tell him not to delay.
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
But after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
—running around. Not your work.  You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
No, they won't. Not when you are there. Oh, please, be a sport. Please ask me.
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
Cyril!
Good for you. Come on.
Oh, you're not so badly off. There's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
I'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
Oh, yeah?
Oh no, Mr. Cluett, if it's all the same to you, I'd rather not wait. It's about you and Mrs. Dickson.
I'm terribly sorry. I'd forgotten all about you. I'm so sorry, dear.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Yes, of course.
Guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. When are you and Matt going to get married?
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
No, sir.
My goodness, you ought to have a uniform. How much does one cost?
Yes, you are. You're protecting somebody. Now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. It can't be as important as this. Now come on, tell me. Where were you last night?  Come on, don't be a fool. Matt, you trust me, don't you?
Oh, I can explain about that later. You're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Yes.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
I'll talk to them. Listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. Tell 'em not to pay any attention to what I said. Tell 'em to verify every signature.
Get all the big bills in the place. Take them out and get them changed. Get nothing but ones and fives. Distribute them among the tellers. Tell them to take their time. Stall as much as possible. Count and recount the money.
But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
Oh, is that so?
I tell you, I saw them!
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
You used to carry a gun, didn't you?
Okay, Matt.
Yeah, what did he do with his first one?
Sometimes a wound will kill.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
Stop by our spread after that, tell our Ma we're all right. We'll go to Doc Mimms.
Exactly.
Hey!
You are a fine figure of a man.
Listen, Jesse, we've got a problem.  It's Cole.
He's planning a job.
Let's ride.
I got three.
Why aren't we the "Younger-James Gang"? I mean, there's three Younger brothers and only two James brothers here.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
A bad idea.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Missed you too, cousin.
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Shakespeare.  He's European.
Where is Jesse James?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Hell of a war.
Your Zee? Hmm.  "From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: they sparkle still the right Promethean fire; They are the books, the arts, the academes, that show, contain, and nourish all the world."
Heard of him.
Ma.
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
That he was.
I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Take care of each other, boys. You say your prayers.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
You're sick of my company?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
"Blazing Guns of the West. True Stories of Jesse James." Only a dime in the hotel lobby.
You are a hell of a woman.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
Communion.
I was always jealous Web Mimms got to go off and fight with you and Cole. Now it's my turn.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
I'll teach these podunks what happens when they challenge the righteousness of progress.
How much did they get from the safe?
We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
What is that?
Not to mention my men who lost their lives.
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Eight?
Is it a what?
Pull out, goddamnit!
Take it off.
You and...Luis?
Yes, Courtney?
Would you like to see my apartment?
Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Nice.
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?
You saw the ad in the Times?
No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times. But... doesn't Paul Owen still live here?
What exactly do you mean?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
What?
I want to get high off this; Bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Your friend has already been seated. Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
No, not really.
Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I...need it for... taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
What do you think I do?
Well...
I m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
She's from...France.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Oh right. Well, I haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  Not on "Page Six" at least.
No, really. I'm okay.
Your address?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Don.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
I'll be there.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
Yes.
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job?
What am I gonna do?
Speak up. Come on.
You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell.
We should've gone to Dorsia. I could've gotten us a table.
I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.
What're you -- what?
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Nothing.
I know you think I'm too attached to him, but still. I am close to Gary. And you're the most meaningful person in my life.  I'm going back to the Comix place, why should I be killing myself.
Right... What's that mean again?
And Outpost? You're happy there?
What?!
That'd change with a criminal indictment.
We tried!
I do!
Talk about work? Never!
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
'Have a look?
...Worse?
Oh, that's right. You're "clueless."
In exchange for endowments. They should just drop the pretense and name the schools after 'em.
I mean, it's your life.
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
Man, could he write code. Totally elegant. He had his own style.
Got out of my other commitment.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I'm calling Gary.
Where we going?
Show me.
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
You thought about it too. You've been suspicious for a while. But it's not happening in there. It's happening in the Day Care.
But why would they --?
No, no. Never.
They've got this guy in the DOJ, maybe others. We tell the wrong person, it's over.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Say there's just one "mole" working there, like Barton at the DOJ. How do we know he's not the guy we've contacted? Or she? Or the guy she works for?
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary.
Thank God.
Why?!
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
But you said the other --
I don't know.
Did you tell Alice?
I dunno. I guess Larry's got me totally suspicious of that place.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
Yes.
Hey, how are you?
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
My God, Vanessa's got a smashing body. I bet she shags like a minx. How do I tell them that because of the unfreezing process, I have no inner monologue?  I hope I didn't say that out loud just now.
Yes?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition. Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war.
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
What?
That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch. I get bad vibes from him, man. Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog.
We've got a doctor's appointment-- an evil doctor's appointment.
I never forget a pussy... cat.
I'm sorry.
I am not.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
Too right, youth. That's why I need you to lead the troops.
Likewise.
Behave!
Here, have a piece of gum.
Hey! Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Can't you see I'm only half a man? Look at me, I'm a freak!
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
They're mutated sea bass.
Don't be so hard on yourself. You're here, that's what's important. A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
You always do that!  Anyways, this is really hard, because, you know, my Dad is really evil.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
He's asleep.
Did you ever want to?
I know. Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had.
Well, it's kind of weird.
Really?
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
... bottle ...
... death ...
... power ...
... love...
You and I. Together. But first you must confront your greatest enemy. Who could that be, Mrs. Peel? The answer is obvious ...
Ropes?
He tried to warn us ...
After the cold war ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
Oh, no, Emma. They've only just begun ...
The result would be ...
Then what's stopping you?
I had a spot of bother at the door.
Much better.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
A Gentleman has to have a code. This is part of mine. A uniform. Think of it as my suit of shining armor.
As per mother's instructions.
I meant me.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
How on earth can you tell?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
That's what we were working on.
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
Because you always obey orders ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Winning isn't everything.
Have a look at this.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
I know all this.
In your operation.
No, please! I beg you ...
That's not playing by the rules.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Oh, come on, just a little.
I love that car.
Maybe it had something to do.
She's mine!
Yes I did.
Fine. How's everything going?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Sure have...
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
It looks awful.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Why don't you get undressed.
Rick, you're lying!
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
I am committed. I love you.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
You're so romantic...
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Your whores never showed up.
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
What are you...
Screw you...
Let's have a toast.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I didn't know you were into that.
I want women.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
That's it.
Ha, ha, ha.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
All right, who serves?
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Rick!
Oh, no!
You've been having strange sex...!
Olivier's in that, right?
Right in there, pal.
My Debbie?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
I don't know.
Be gentle.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Sheep don't count.
I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
What you did was drop the ball, Probie. Get that right.
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
Yeah... too bright...
Just... Just wanted to say hello...
Saw what?
I know.
I knew when you came looking for the chemicals. Looking for me.
I'm his Lt. He's my responsibility. I'll handle it. Me.
Shut up!
Thanks for calling.
Huh.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed.  Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
Well, you did invite me here.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
Then why did you quit?
Your boss is lying, Jennifer.
What'll you do?
The outlets.
Not such a far walk after all, is it, Brian?
I want another shot, Sir.
-- I don't give a damn what your test scores were, maybe you could have been a good firemen, but you had your shot.
See you Monday. Sir.
Yeah? Airtight?
How ya feeling?
Four months.
No need to be modest, Brian.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
I have a job.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
Lots of fires. They promote faster there. Take a look at the last Lt.'s list, half the guys on it came from that battalion. Gotta think about your future, Timmy. 115's the station.
"Probationary Fireman Brian McCaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double-check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with Anna Rodriguez, a seamstress for the North Shore Clothing Company... McCaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."
Well, let's have a look.
He just wants to --
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
-- You remember.
He treats you okay?
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
You can't keep being his father...
Wouldn't miss this for the world, pal.
Ronald here likes telephones. Used to tape wooden matches to the bell striker and wrap it in cotton. Came up with a whole little thing there, didn't you Ronald? When you got bored, what did you do? You just started making calls... mostly day care centers and retirement homes, wasn't it?
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
What the fuck are you? A drug counselor or a drug dealer? And you don't even do your own product! What kind of businessman are you?
Very good. Very good. The Mets are gonna win tomorrow.
I forgive you.
Let me think about it.
This psycho can.
I've been dodging bullets since I was fourteen. No one can kill me. I'm fucking blessed. I'm fucking Catholic.
What case?
How 'bout...
Alright.  Here we go.  Let's go NIGGERS!  LET'S GO NIGGERS!
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
So now I see where you're coming from.  Just because we ain't rapping about Gucci, Timberland, Rolex, Benz, Cristal, ho's and bitches, we're pseudo.
I'm a revolutionary.
Why are you smiling so?
Moorish.  Ya get a little taste of dat booty, ya wanna get some MORE.
You ain't happy about the green light?
In fact, we never knew she had any friends period.
Meaning?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
And I'm the feet.
Well do something about it.
EUREKA!!
No costume.  No blackface.
Can I finish?  Thank you.  I had a great Aunt, we called her Sister. She went to her grave not believing man had walked on the Moon. 
That's exactly what I think.  I want you to create something that people want to see.  Let's be honest, the majority of the people in the country are deaf, dumb and blind and I'm including 35 million African-Americans.  You know and I know "niggers" set the trend, set the styles.  This is a golden opportunity now.  These idiots have to be led to the water.
It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan.
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
What are there character traits?
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
What are you talkin' 'bout?  It's the move.  Stay wid me now.  We're movin' fast.  What does everybody else think about this?
Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
Funnier to who and at who's expense? Dunwitty, when Negroes start to run amok, the boycotts, when the demostrations commence, I'm giving them your home address.  Let's see how you like it when they picket your lawn in Greenwich, Connecticut.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to speak with you.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this?
Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
For what?
I don't want to hear it.
That crazy brother of yours doesn't think so.
Please don't go there.
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I didn't think this was in your studies at NYU.
Kook and the Gang, it's Manray. Let's do the taping.  You go back to your dressing room, get dressed and blacken up.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
Son, Peerless is your name.  Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
I will.  And good luck with your show.  I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard.  You deserve it.
He said that?
I don't even know why you're still concerned over him.  Daddy's not with you.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Soon.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I don't know who I am.
Years ago I married a widow who had a grown-up daughter.  My daddy visited us often, fell in love with my stepdaughter and married her. Thusly he became my son-in-law and my stepdaughter became my mother because she was my father's wife. Soon after dis my wife gave birth to a son, which of course was my father's brother in-law and my uncle, for he was the brother of my step-mother.  My father's wife also became the mother of a son.  He was of course my brother and also my grandchild for he was the son of my daughter.  Accordingly, my wife was my grandmother because she was my mother's mother. 
Are you trying to rap to me?
Never read a book in my whole life.
You look beautiful like that.
That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Good morning.
That is none of your business.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
All Europe shall hear of this!
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I believe they will deport you.
Certain?
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Have you had one?
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
When is he to go?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Yes, he's fine.
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
It's ten thirty in the morning.
I thought I was gonna have an attack. Go into a fit and bite off my own tongue in the middle of the bayou. Childs could tell I wasn't right.
It's... too slow.
You did Basic here?
Yeah. And that's all I'm saying.
I'm serious --
Yeah. Spent half his time in the infirmary. Only reason he enlisted was his father. West didn't section him till last week.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
West... he's dead.
So did we. Why didn't you come?
West's. Any kindling for afire?
You're lying --
His chest was hamburger --
They?
Mueller and Childs. One of them must've taken the grenade from my pack on the chopper...
Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.
There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
Because I was standing next to him.
Maybe --
Tell me what I can do.
Cadet Roberto R. Nunez. Killed right in front of me.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
I wouldn't know where to start.  I guess it was about one man framing another. He thought if the other guy got blamed, people would over look his own wrong doings.
You're drunk --
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Why?
What point?
Have no fear, Osborne, we have not yet begun to fight.
I lied. Wait for it...
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
But you will.
What?
Dunbar... He said he didn't shoot West. West wasn't shot, Kendall said he was blown apart by a phosphorous grenade and Dunbar never saw the body.
And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
For what?
Right back where we started.
I don't think I want to hear this --
You better watch it, faggot, I'm not sure you and Childs didn't do him --
Yeah and he doesn't know when --
He whispered it in my ear.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Bullshit --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
He's not Army, it's not official --
Tough break. Most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
Kid. Don't waste your time. She's out of your league.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
I've got a whole backpack full of clothes!
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Let's see it.
No.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
So I've heard.
I see. I thank you for your time.
I'll...
I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.
Terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. Wasn't three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "Your Grampa is going to die." Well, I ran right back to my parents. My father said, no, Gramps is fine, but I could see there was trepidation. And true enough, that next morning my Grampa was dead.
Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat a lot, can't you?
What's your name, Giant?
Jesus Christ.
I'm not scared.
The Old Lady by the swamp.
What did he say?
I used to do it when you were gone, remember? I used to do it a lot.
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
Okay. Okay.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Go out with me.
I was astonished to see the greatest poet of both Ashton and Spectre all the way out in Texas.
Edward, it's got your deposit slip on it.
Because he's dying.
My father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I'm sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I'm just trying to reconcile the two.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
I need to lie down for a bit.
I need you on my side.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
How much time does he have left?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man.  The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were good.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
Do you want to stop?
Ch...
Right.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Yes.
They go.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
Yes.
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't hate you.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
Some... What does that mean?
So now you hate all women?
Get out.
She's alive?
Nobody's that unhappy.
What was her name?
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Don't make it less true.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
You think I'm Ronnie's spy or somethin'? Come tomorrow that dumb- ass gonna be halfway round the world tryin' to keep his head on his shoulders. You think he's gonna be thinkin' about you?
Stop what?
I got others.
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Yeah.
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
And you gonna live it with him?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
I don't love ya no more.
BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
Well I don't...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
How you let men treat ya like they do?
No ma'am.
In my house, you watch that lip...
You can holla y'self hoarse. Ain't gonna bend my will.  Right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  Gonna suffer you like Jesus say, to the FAITHLESS and the PERVERSE GENERATION.
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
Uh-uh.
If all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  Rae. RAE! I'm not fightin' with ya. I just know you got more in you than junk.  Now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  You know how to boil water?
You drink whiskey?
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
You think God forgives people like that?  You think God forgives people like me?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
Maybe I won't.
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
You collar that dog, boy. I ain't gonna hurt nobody. Just wanted to know who she was.
What'chu sayin'?
Go ask him.
I think you did alright by God under the circumstances.  Your people are here for you, Laz. This is your home. No shame in showing your face.
Why's his britches round his knees?
Or what?
I told you to TURN BACK!
What's that chain around her for?
Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
Please don't tell my daddy.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
Yeah?
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
Ronnie. Please, baby...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
Let go...
It's not regulation.  And the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
No.
You didn't take, did you...?  You hear things.
I said let's go, Charlie.
Pussy, ass, soft personnel.
Hey, all right.
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
I can see that.
There she is!
I'll check it out.
It's illegal, Nick.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
I can't...
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I need someone to translate for me.
You met her.
Save it, I already took the tour.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Yeah.
Work with me.  I want your best detective.
Can we skip the poetry, inspector?
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
The families who control the casinos?
Not with these bills.  And even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
You want him dead too.
Oh?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
We've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
Like...
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
When do you deliver your project?
Where do we start?
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
She's not with you?
You start.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
But I would like to buy you drink.
Shot of vodka, please.
My pleasure.
Ya.
No thanks.
Four years.
Yeah.  But that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I know what they are, Deck -- Look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
Huh huh.
Can I come in?
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Are you for real?
What the fuck for?
Hey!  Do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
And who do I go to about you?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
You show the picture to your husband. He likes it and hangs it on the wall. The girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
In your opinion.
Where is he?
I am.  Part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
It wasn't very good last night, was it?
Nope.  Nobody could stand me that long.
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
No, I don't.
What difference will it make?
I'll see you in a minute.
If she is, the machine works.
How do you know I'm not?
What desert?
Thanks.
I'm Adam Webber.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
How do you do?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Yes, I'm right?
Right.
Again.
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Oh, I could die...
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Okay.
I haven't brushed yet.
Why not go to work for me?
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
How long would you need me?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
A wife?
Yes.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Of course.
Sorry!
Never drive again!
In the house?
So, what are you seeing?
Okay!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Well...yeah. Okay.
Not that one!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
I'm sorry.
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Neat. Goodnight!
My mother's like that.
Nothing.
A card?
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Because he must!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
Yeah.
I don't think so.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Okay.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I don't see anything!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Sorry, Mom!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll be all right.
You're my brave boy.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
All back East.
Days??
Then after that it's safe.
I'm not hungry.
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
What shall we call him?
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
Coming!
You bet.
Yes...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
That's what I'm sensing.
What do you think, Adam?
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
To bed?
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
I don't know. I like to think so.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
I'm not sick.
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
I was the same way when I was your age. I guess that's what got me into this business.
And it's horrible too.  I'm sorry Jeffrey. That's the way it has to be. Anyway. I'm sure you do understand.
Yes?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
The criminals are winning.
You're all through with this now?
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I saw you come in, talk on the phone. Get undressed.
No. Come on.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
Lie down on the bed.
I'll go then.
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Frank would open you.
I asked first.
And sometimes you think you don't?! Well, get away then!
I'm glad you do.
I want you to stay with me.
What?
You look beautiful to me.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
My bourbon.
Frank?
Yes, but.
Those are my breasts.
No thanks. What does that mean?
On a ride.
Well. Okay.
Yeah?
Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.
I just know, that's all. I remember you from Central.
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Yeah. It's close by, that's what's creepy. They've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except I don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Yeah, but.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't...
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I guess so. You want to help me watch Frank? I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow with a camera.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Just go over to Gelford and up to Vista. It's not far. Can you tell me any more about what you learned?
You look beautiful.
Really?
Sandy, this guy is a killer!! I promise you.
Yes.
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Just for him?
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
Aye.
Got it.
What?
What are you saying?
Think about it man. Nine men, six bullets.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
Do me a favor and roll it around for a bit on your way in.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Aw, c'mon. I gotta clear my family name here. I've brought shame to the house of Della Rocco.
C'mon!
What?  What, that guy?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
We... met them last night.
They had some pretty interesting bandages. Know anything about that?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I'll call you tonight, afterwards. 
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
Don't even do it, ya bastard.
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Okay. We're ready.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
Me too. That's stupid. Name one thing we're gonna need it for.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
He's a good man.
And the pennies?
Excellent! Number two. Greenly.
Possible, but unlikely. The angles are too extreme. A guy holding two guns to the back of your head is gonna shoot straight ahead. He wouldn't cock out his elbows, makes no sense. Besides, you telling me one guy came in here and killed eight men with eight extremely well aimed shots in just a few seconds? No way. Had to be at least two.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
Fucking figures. Look, are you guys seeing the pattern here? We got big questions at both of these crime scenes, with no answers. WHY did they kill the guys in the other two booths? WHY did he do the bartender? It would seem unnecessary, even stupid.  God, I hate cold crime scenes! I'm fucking leaving now. And do me a favor, tell me when the next guy dies, cause these guys are not done yet.
Sweet-n-low!
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Eight.
Witness?
Well you tell him ta take it easy with that. He's gotta learn ta respect women the way Connor does.
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
I'll be back at 9:00.
Roc. You okay?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
So?
Well, I'm sold.
Yes.
You feel? A soul is what gives you feelings. Happiness, guilt, right or wrong. It is a conduit through which the Lord speaks to us. You felt that your answers would be here in the house of God today. You feel these men are necessary. The Lord has spoken to you twice this day.
I guess not.
You know them personally?
Yes.
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Making Hutch David Soul?
OK. That's wrong.
Dignan, it's --
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Would they do that?
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
Eight dollars.
Yeah.
That's a good question. No. I don't. I'm just being hypocritical here. However, I will say --
You're right. You're right.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
She's not going to notice, Anthony.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
It's a great shirt. Don't worry about it.
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
No kidding.
Well, the world is a little bit colder today.
No, I'm serious. He made me a diagram.
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
What is it?
What's Hinckley Cold Storage?
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
I did.
You're all clear.
Hang on a second.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
Nobody move!
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Applejack's stuck in the elevator?
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
Yeah.
What'd he get?
We're not sure yet. It's going to need some repairs.
That's a sharp jacket.
How'd he do?
I don't want to die.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
Let them fight.
No, I don't mind.
Prison tatoos. I got to be pretty good. It's not like drawing on paper.
Nothing. I was just asking.
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
What's he doing here?
Looks like he's staying with Buckethead. That's what I figured. He's probably got his own room. Let's see where he's going.
OK, Bob.
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Let's just go.
He electrocuted someone?
His name was Swifty?
I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
Bob, I've got nightmares.
There were more than that.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Not in that car you're not.
Good luck, since I got the keys.
Just get in the car, Bob.
Anthony. Bad news.
Let's go!
Do you have your own cell?
I'm working on it.
Social issues. Crime prevention.
Did you hear that?
We're just going over a few things.
Come on in!
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
...this is Conklin's computer.
They found Danny Zorn's body. Dead in the basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.
No... It must have been Bourne.
I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Jesus...
I speak English.
He's dead.
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
How long? How long do I have -- 
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
The Telegraph office.
No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there... 
-- not yet --
There must be another way!
Get on it.
Who is Pamela Landy?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
You didn't answer my question.
Why you're alive?  You're alive because you're special. Because she kept you alive.  Because we want you back on our side.
If you ever want to make it to five, you're gonna listen to me real close. Jason Bourne is armed and extremely dangerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in Berlin, one of whom was a highly-experienced field officer... 
Amnesia?
Did you?
It's got caffeine in it. That's all I know.
Alright... I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on Bourne, track everything that's out there...
We just had a funeral, isn't that what it means in England as well?
Didn't want your father to die either, did ya? But it happened.
We cannot defeat this --
Impossible.  How dare you bring a panicky lie.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!
Wallace's followers.
Simply because he eluded your trap, do you think he is more than a man? My father is dying. Perhaps you should think of our coronation.
That's just a dream, William!
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. It's here.
I should'a remembered the eggs.
So more men were slaughtered uselessly!
We must have alliance with England to prevail here. You achieved that! You saved your family, increased your lands! In time you will have all the power in Scotland!... Yet you grieve.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
Nor I!
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
I need you so much! I love you!
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
It does me good to see you.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
When I asked Evan about his drawing, well, he didn't remember doing it.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
No.
What the fuck are you doing?
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
I know, but...
Those are your clothes, silly.
Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
Because you're... different.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
Oh? There's proof now?
Know what?
That I didn't leave you there to rot.
Which is?
Stop! Take me back!
I don't get it.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
There is no "right". When you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
Damn, Evan, on the D.L.
Thumper had a busy afternoon.
What happened?? Where are we?!
I'm sorry.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
A champagne cocktail, please.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Occupied France?
And the other alternative?
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
And I was wondering.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
The stairs from the street.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
No.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Because you're getting on that plane.
I don't understand. What about you?
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Goodnight.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
No, Victor, no.
Apparently he has the letters.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Very well.
I slept very well.
May we proceed with the business?
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
And that is?
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Thank you.
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
His escape.
Why two?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
I have my orders.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Huh?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
Sam's piano.
I have. Sit down over there.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
You ever going to bed?
Then don't have a drink.
Uh, my watch stopped.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
Worse than Warsaw.
Wilson, do you believe this?  Take the damn water.
Survive today, that's the point.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
I'm dancing on the roof of the Peabody Hotel.  With Kelly.
Well, I do a little drawing --
Well, not really, I --
Must be a story there.
I thought I did.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
We're a little emotional here.  It's Christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
Go on.  We'll be fine.  I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
That about sums it up.
It means a lot...that you came.
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Which I didn't have.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
Not to mention on me.
This is my home.  I'm part of the wallpaper.
What's going on down there?
Forget it.
That's why I'm running foreign and you're not.  That's why you're not married and I am.
Take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  That's FedEx, that's women, that's life.
We're on.
That's all there is.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Good night, Daddy.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
He's *paralyzed*!
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Sure. Thanks.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
*Liver* killed him?
That's why Kong loves her!
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Where are you going?
You're the one who's helping *me*, Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Where'd she get you?
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
That's 'cause I sticked my *own* knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my *own* knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
I don't think so.
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I don't need your gratitude.
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Sorry, Homer...
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
She took off in the night!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Sort of like a letter of intent.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
Gee... What makes you say that?
Just the last three weeks.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
Guess so.
Mob?
So what? We hide, right?
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
Alright, let's all put our dicks back in our pants for a second. Is this the best thing to do?
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Two million.
How's that? He works for Gillette.
You sure?
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Calls?
What do I always tell you guys? Don't spend it all. Sooner or later we're going to run into some bad luck. Save some. Put it away, so when shit like this happens, you're not desperate. That's it. The gig's up.
I have a good crew.
Come here!
All the shit we pulled with you and you're trying to shake us down? You guys got sack.
Hey, listen... If you guys don't pay your taxes, that's your business.
Don't worry about Moonan. We got him covered. When...?  It was him. There's a shipment coming through tonight. Kennedy.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
Help me.
I just have a good feeling about you. Haven't you ever had someone say they had a good feeling about you before?
I'll worry about Customs.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
You want to talk about an old boyfriend right now?
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
Just mail it to the hospital.  Mr. King, please. It's regarding an accounting problem. Yes... Correct... I know where it is. That will be fine. Thank you.
What do we need another Shill for?
Breasts.
I'm just thinking out loud here, but... Two million in a briefcase?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
What are you talking about? Yes we have. And we would have been beautiful about it. We would've had a bucket of chicken delivered to the King with a nice kiss my ass card attached to it. Then we woulda moved on 'til the next local putz caught on.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
Do you have a ticket?
This is embarrassing.
I'll find the time.
What I'm saying is, is that the King ain't gonna care. See he had a real thing with getting this Gillette guy, If you ask me I think he's jealous.
Eee Oott Auught!
A little bit of both.
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
The King.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
I try.
Whaddya mean? We got dick.
What's the Blue Book price?
Seven-fifty.
She went back to South Africa.
I'll try and make it.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I've got something to tell you.
What job?
Poor baby.  This'll relax you.
Are you drunk?
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
It will.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You're entitled to your opinion.
Never. Why do you ask?
Found a job?
You know where I'm from?
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
I didn't.
What kind of trouble?
The point is, they want a man inside.
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
No thank you.
I'm Lucy.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Not bad. I have other interests, of course.
Vodka. Straight. On the rocks.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
No.
Any exceptions?
Give me 365.
Five.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
The one on unit... oh, I think it's GMR twelve zero zero.
Where is the key?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Fuck that shit.
Well, then, everything sounds fine. We'll drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Fine. Think about this one, then: how do you know you exist?
That's good. Very good. Now then, how do you know that anything else exists?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
And you can only do it once, right?
So if you detonate in...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
You have no proof that it was correct data.
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
Talby was in the air lock. You blew him out of the ship. I'm going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can contact him.
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I'm in the Computer Room, and I think I've located the malfunction. The scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser, down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can't pinpoint it exactly, but I'm going down there with a starsuit and try to find it.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some debris from the ship! It's coming right by me.
Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.
Ah... it seems to me, Doolittle... Sorry, I've drawn a blank. Hold it. I'll have it again in a minute. I forget so many things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me think...
Oh, yes... Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Bruno's girlfriend.
I'm on a break.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
This won't hurt.  Triple dose of insulin, you'll go into a coma, couple minutes you'll stop breathing and on a busy night, the coroner will probably mistake it for an O.D.  Plus, it's way classier than blowin' your brains out.
You know each other?
No.
Could you give us a moment.
I'll make it worth your while.
Thanks, it's starting to kick in.  I feel almost human.
Yech...
I couldn't get to her.  It all happened so fast.  Logan had her, and I saw him fall...then Peter told me to run.  And then he...and I remember so clearly, thinking it's me they want.  If I run, maybe they'll come after me.  Maybe they won't think about her... So I ran...
Look, I'd really like to...
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
What's your shot in all this?  Being a famous, anonymous, underground, pirate, cyber-journalist can't be much of a payday.
So what are you gonna do about it?
You accept the way things are, you're an active participant in making it worse.
I won't be staying.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Hardly...
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
What's in it for you?
She's prepared to testify that she was instructed to do this by one of Edgar Sonrisa's managers.  You know who Sonrisa is?
They want me...bad.  Or at least they don't want me grabbed up by the Chinese or whoever.  Best case, I wind up back in that facility.  More likely, it's a long drive out in the country, if you know what I mean.
Open it.
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Let go of my hand.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Here's your money.
You and me both.
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
If I knew what you were saying, I wouldn't be asking.
And because he's my friend.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
I actually know how this works.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
You're the best, Maxie.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
But there's another side--
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
You would be making a mistake to come away from this thinking she's the villain in the piece... You are.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
Tell him I took the day off 'cause I wasn't feeling so hot.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
Don't be so glum, Hawk. The night's still young and filled with plenty of compensatory possibilities.
You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
I-I c-can't...
Yeah?
I don't care. I wanna hear more.
My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
That'd be great. Hey, maybe someday your band'll play there. It's a college town, you know?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
Totally. All I've had for chow was a packet of Pop Rocks and a Yoo-hoo.
Pizza, and I been jones-in' for a pizza ever since we left St. Bernard's.
Damn straight we are.
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Tickets?
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Sure.
It's my Bullworker.
Check.
Christine stole it! Asleep, my ass! The stella booted with your mom's wheels.
Grounded for the rest of the year?
What?!
What?
You know what they say about a big ass... big shit.
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Yeah? I have a saying too, Lex. It goes, "Catch my jizz in your mouth and stop jinxing us, asshole." We're going this time and that's all there is to it.
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Now that's what I like to hear!  Because too many young men and women today are paralysed by their fears. They give in to their feelings of self-doubt... they surrender their bodies to the temptations of drugs, alcohol and premarital sex. Empty solutions. These are toxic chemicals... and disease-spreading behaviour.
Did you know him?
The basic principles of time travel are there.  So you have the vessel and the portal. And the vessel can be anything. Most likely a spacecraft.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
What makes you think I'm not?
Sure.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
My mom is gone.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Where are we going?
Well, life isn't that simple. So what if Ling Ling kept the cash and returned the wallet? That has nothing to do with either fear or love.
When did you stop taking your medication?
I stopped rolling houses in the sixth grade, Mom.  Get out of my room.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Well... they say it right when they are ripping the place to shreds. When they flood the house. That like... destruction is a form of creation. So the fact that they burn the money is... ironic. They just want to see what happens when they tear the world apart.  They want to change things.
Where are you going?
Follow him where?
Into the future.  Then he said that the world was coming to an end.
I met a girl.
It reminded me of my dog Callie.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
What did you want for Christmas that year?
Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
He's right there... He can read my mind and he'll show me the way out of this. The sky is going to open up... and then He will reveal himself to me.
What does time travel have to do with philosophy?
Her name is Gretchen.
Congratulations.
Gerald.
What I think is going on with your son.
You're telling me my son has an imaginary friend?
He was a year ahead of us?
Go back to China, bitch!
No more fuckin' for her.
Don't let that worry you, Annette!
Oh God, I'm dead...
Really, Loretta?
I got it! Yeah, why don't ya take a...
Yah?
Honest to God, if I got to do it over? I'd start walkin' outta this town the minute I took my first step. Practically the only thing I wouldn't do different is have you...
We was robbed.
Sorry. I -- I don't make the rules.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
Are we on "Cops" again?
She's the prettiest, y'know. The best damn tapper. The most smartest...
My dress'll reek.
Wisconsin.
We're not in the showroom, Dear.
Let go! Let go of me. Oh my God, it's COPS!
Y'betcha, Iris. We still need a third judge and we need to think of a theme.
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
"Proud... to be... an... American."
Shut up, Hank. This here's business.
Tina! Tina!! TINA!!!
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
And wear a crown and everything.
Yes, sir. 
What kind of a dog is he?
Well - what is he now?
Yankee Poodle.
I'm sorry I'm not in.  I wanted to have a long talk with you...  Now look here, my good man, you've got to stop yelling "peanuts" in front of the House of Representatives.
I don't wanna work at all.
'At's-a fine.
You told it to me.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
Oh, sure.  We have horse maneuvers every morning.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Fine.  We gotta him. 
Well, with you two fellows on the other side, this country should have no trouble keeping the wolf from the door.
Yes, but I'll talk to you about that when we're alone...
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Go ahead.
I haven't been on the job five minutes and already she's making advances to me.  Not that I care -- but where is your husband?
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
WHAT  ?
Gloria -- I've waited for years.  I won't be put off!  I love you!  I want you!  Can't you see that I'm at your feet?
If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
That I am very little different from him.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
Deformed? Is that it. Then am I to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Good! How is the patient?
Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Of course they will. They're reasonable men.
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
Are you comfortable here?
Yes, of course... Well, it's been a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Merrick. Good day.
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
What a mess.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
No, nothing.
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...I learned a long time ago.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Of course! What did you think?
Oh yes.
Oh, our relatives... the children.
Friends. Ah yes, friends! How nice.
It's for you, John. It's all for you. Go ahead, let them see you.
Yes, very soon.
Then I shouldn't change anything?
No, he's very upset about something.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
HE'S GONE!
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
It's your fantasy...
What?
Why do you go on about that? What does it matter?
I've never been to bed with anybody!
I mean, you could have killed yourself.
Then let go!
Not quite...
No... no...
I will go and wake them up!
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
He wants to kill US!
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Yes... oh, yes...
What -- rape?
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Ah.
Louder.
What?
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
I know. I know.
What?
You'll see!
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Fenrir the Wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
What is it?
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Bastard.
Oh...
What have you got there?
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
My brother blacksmiths!
Together we stand!
You can't let Erik do THAT.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
You went berserk...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
Helpless...
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
Me too.
I'm not frightened... of anything...
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
You rat.
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
Huckleberry Hound?
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Yeah?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I guess.
Yeah.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
You should stay.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
No. Thanks.
No.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
This is our first "date" date.
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
And I didn't have an argument.
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
yeah?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
I love her.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
What if you stay this time?
I love you.
What if?
Oh, um...
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Hey, lover. Whatcha doing?
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
It's not somebody else.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
Oh! Great. That's great!
'kay.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Where?
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
What do you want, Stan?
Thanks.
Alexander Pope?
I have a family, Mary.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
Maybe after the holidays then.
She likes you okay.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
If we Ivy Leaguers aren't earthy enough to suit you hillbillies, at least we don't go around indulging in racist terms such as 'Chink.' Next thing I know, you'll be calling me 'chief.'
Why? Why do you have to go?
American Cheese. The king of road food.
I was a successful model once.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
On my way.
Smith, clear that airlock, man, I'm coming in.
We'll make it.
A power drain --
Pressure?
It's the Event Horizon. She's come back.
Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing you any favors.
You don't just dismiss Bill Weir. The man held Oppenheimer's chair at Princeton. If the Event Horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since Einstein.
Clear and open on my mark. Three... two... one... mark.
Frozen.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
Negative.
The Core...!
You said this ship creates a gateway...
I don't know...
I don't know...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
You... You can't do that!
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
No, no, we just got her back together...
It's building up with every breath we take. And the CO2 filters on the Event Horizon are shot.
No. I'll be right back.
...repeat, we're armed...
Miller, he's back, he was in the tank...
Shit, Doc, any closer and we're gonna need a rubber...
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
How?
I'm sorry.
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
I mean...
No, it's not. I thought I was done waiting for Reed... We're all in this together now, Ben.
Where do you think? With Sue.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Baby, you're scaring me.
Should?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Go back to the drawing board.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
You've been working out.
Gotcha. Okay. Supernova bad.
Right, whatever, have fun.
Now.
Johnny.
Sweet.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope. I'm done with this freak show. I'm moving back to the real world.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
What? What do you mean you --
If it happened to him, then it could...
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
You need a doctor.
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
Please, no apologies. I've arranged for your things to be moved to one of my condos. You'll have round-the clock care.
Oh, I think you already have.
Yes. I think so. Show some pride, Hamilton.
They're not home yet.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
See you later.
They were left over from the last shift.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Leave me alone.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
Come on...
How about both of us at the same time?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
What? Now?
Get going.
The Attitude? The Attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. Whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. When you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have The Attitude.
Did you go home and get it?
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Okay. See ya.
Sensitive -- what is that?
I'm Carrie Frazier from Toys 'R Us. Judy Hinton from May Company told me I could ask you something.
I was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
I wanted to talk a little bit about school, if I could...
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Believe it.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
No. But it's a nice idea.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
No.
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
What?
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
Not coming? What happened?
Yeah, like maybe never.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
I don't know.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
How about your phone number?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
You keep them.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham?
What about the notes?
I'll get you the notes.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
I'll have one more Coke... Do you want another Coke, Stacy?
He is. Don't worry, I'll get it to him.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
IN VIETNAM! ON THE GODDAMN TELEVISION!
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
And nobody did anything?
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
We won't make the nut unless we have unlimited credit.
My heart!
Thirty minutes. It was going to be very close.
Lacerda?
Why what?
What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
GO?
Calm down. You'll be straight in a few hours.
I want to leave fast.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Us?
Right. Let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon. I feel a powerful lust for red salmon...
They're actually nice people when you get to know them.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Like big lizards.
Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me. I got your message... what? Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while. Yeah. I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out...
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST!
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
They'll get in! We'll all die!
Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Shit!
Just an observation.
Why don't you go check it out?
What's in the back?
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
Is it gassed up?
Whoa!
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
What the hell's going on here!?
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
Don't worry, you'll be like my little papoose.
That's fine.
I'll do anything to help.
Yeah, I mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
What?
Where's Clifford?
An actress.
...Yes.
We'll get you home, Frances.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
I love you too, Francie.
Daddy!
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
Yeah.
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Hey, I'm a man, aren't I? Whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  For old time's sake.
If they say they love it, they'll probably love it. Not everybody lies, you know?
Animal magnetism!  No ginger beer. What's this red stuff?
You're coming.
Who said I was a lady?
I guess.
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
To quarter-horses.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I don't know.
Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
Very slow.  But we're not going to stop, are we?
No, we're not.
And no people.
Yes.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Who're you?
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Good. Then it's very simple. You have to stop being afraid, Frances. It's in you.
Yes, Ma.
I don't care.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
What's wrong?
But what -- 
Excuse me.
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Stay calm, please.
But you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you think I should believe?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
I am as he made me. In his own image.
The music? Or the fire?
I am afraid.
Materials. Nothing more.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
Stolen memories. Stolen and hazy. They taunt me in my dreams. I've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. Whose woman was this? I've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. Whose childhood friends were these?  Who am I?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
Read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. We'll say it came today. It'll set his mind at ease.
God took her from us.
Is that what makes it so delicious?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Come now. Magnus? Agrippa? Next thing you know, you'll be teaching toadstools to speak.
Blasphemy be damned! Waldman spent his life trying to help people!
I've been preoccupied.
We all know how hard you took Waldman's death. Even Krempe is sympathetic. But it is time to move on. It is time to concern yourself with life.
This. My home. My family.  If not for you, I'd be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
Despite the lack of challenge.
I'm... dying.
Are you a physician?
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
Your men are right to be afraid.
Jack? Marcie? Ned?
Tomorrow is another day.
Sure.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Marcie?
Hey, guys!
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I don't believe you...
Quote: Controlled substances are expressly forbidden. Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. Unquote.
Ned!
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
I call it my shower dream.
Why not?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
Twenty-eight.
It's hardly been used at all. I got it from a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God. That's like new.
What about Kate?
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
Come again?
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Yes, they do.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
You won't let him touch her?
I don't have the slightest idea.
Nothing. I didn't make a statement. I asked a question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a loser you can't tell when you've won?  The entire state of Texas, along with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn't. They had every entrance to the border covered. There's no way you could get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You've won, Seth, enjoy it.
Amen.
Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less time, so I'm only giving you the count of three. One...
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
You damn well better. Go.
You must have a bible in here, don't cha?
Anytime.
Me too.
Is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?
Haven't felt it a bit. Been inside with the air conditioner blastin' all day long.
That's all that's been on the box all day. They killed some people didn't they?
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
He signaled the Ranger.
They don't have anything except four walls and a roof, and that's all we need.
What the fuck is she doin' there?!
What?
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
Or what?
This ain't the time.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Really?
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
But are there... I mean, how many...
More than you'd guess.  It's just that we don't hold coffee klatches. If more then three of us get together at any one time, the guys think it's some kind of uprising.
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
Your prerogative, Senator.
Did you just have a brain-fart?
Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell.
Hey.  Ain't your call, man.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter.  And your success would mean a lot.  Jumping, now...
Absolutely not.
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Royce.  We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Wai', wait.  What happens if it works?  Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Which is guy-speak for...
Sure.  I'll join the crowd.
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
What?
Made it to Week 10 last time.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Thanks, Wick.
If you got a good one, Wick...
That's a good story.
He was married?
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
I can't go out.  Not like this.
Maybe half.  Not even.
Green Eggs and Ham.  You're not going to get anywhere.  You might as well put me in the cage.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
I think you're the liar.
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
Thought you two were file-closed.
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
I don't know.  Seems...
Okay, so now work it from the other end.  Think about California -- and how things might be handled there.
Big bites.
Hey, hey! I'm eating here!
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Me!? You where the one...
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
The JFK? In the rain!?
What?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Your old sweetheart?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Oh, I'm not married.
It means that due to a man made accident the Chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. Mutated by seventeen percent?
They're enormous! A new species created by man's recklessness. That's what I've been trying to tell you, I'm only a biologist. I take radioactive samples and study them.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
That thing's dead. What the hell are we waiting for?
I need you to trust me.
Why do you need that?
Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up.
Right... Sorry, sir.
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Come with me. I'll explain on the way.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You'll forgive my impertinence, sir, but even though we had never before met, always considered you as a father to me.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
Must be some sort of mining facility.
You go first! There's no time!
I heard something. A squeal.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
The ships are gaining...
Nobody was WATCHING?
Excuse me guys.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Yes, I know, and I want you to know I thought about what you said... I know you meant it constructively but...
Okay, you can go on in... I'm going to get Kyle. He knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
Lt. Madison, GO.
I never get tired of that joke.
All systems are working, Commander. ,~ -cc	PINK) -' C -
It's suicide.
Something BAD happened here.
Let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
It helps.
Yes. Yes, I'm here!
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
You are so full of shit
I have ONE job on this lousy ship. It's stupid, but I'm going to DO it. GOT IT?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Our former Commander was not... Strong.
A model, only as big as this.
It's difficult to... On our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
I didn't say that.  I said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." That's what I said.
Tommy, we have these...
How about the pig-lizard?
Practice driving, Tommy.
Well, you fought with them against the French and Iroquois, how good were they then?
The man's waiting for you to get wiped off the stage so he can become commander and chief.
Is that a fact.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
None of the servants is to touch a gun!  You know that!
Yes, William.  I am apologizing.
What sort of boots would you say he's wearing?  I should say, no sort of boots at all.  Aren't those rags wrapped around his feet?  Is that what he marched here in?
I, don't know what color is what officer, my lord...
What do you know about these men!? They can stand against anything! They've seen more war than most field generals!  They are not cowards, sir!  They are not afraid!
With pleasure... and an honor.  Did you hear about Nathan Hale?
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there!  Tell them I will give them my decision then.
He's from Virginia -- there is no more classist, elitist... English place on earth than Virginia.  And, what in hell has he done for our cause?  Washington has been preaching compromise, compromise, compromise!  Hancock acts, he led the Boston Tea party!  That's why New England loves him.
Unofficially, General Greene.
Joseph, are you afraid to cross that river with me?  I accept your resignation.  With regret.  You have leave to return to Philadelphia...
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
These supplies...?
When the snow melts, mon petite Marquis, I suspect the only thing blossoming will be bright red British soldiers.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
It's an anti-Christian dogma!  I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Is that why you come in here tossing pennies to my starving men? It's damned condescending!
I don't want to see your hospital.
Sir, Congress hasn't issued their pay for two months, many have not eaten properly for at least that long.  You're being a little hard on them, don't you think?
Well sir, I was an ironmaster before you got me.  Maybe I will let you down yet.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
It is; we need you George.
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Really?  Which precious homily was it?
It's the freest land on earth.
Let's get you darker!
I reserved a Cadillac.
That's your problem. You shouldn't've smoked the guy.
What, the setup didn't work so you want the key back?
No shit? What're some of 'em?
Where's your partner, the jumpy one? Why isn't he here?
You can talk to me.
I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
What money?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
I don't believe this.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Yeah? Which terminal?
I like it here.
Whatever you want, Ray.
I don't like waiting.
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm in the movie business.
What've you got?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
But you work for the casino?
What I did till recently.  After I get done here I'll think about what I'm gonna do next.
Ever shot anybody.
For a movie?
"Mr. Lovejoy".
But I could talk to the limo guys. Tell 'em to leave you alone for a while. Make the point in a way they'd understand it.
What do you get out of this?
Let's see how we get along.
Read it. It's a grabber.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
I had to tell 'em something.
You have it?
Ray Barboni. Guy from Miami, owns Leo now that Momo died.
He died.
Twenty seven hundred.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
That's not bad.
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Like in "Bride of the Mutant", when you played the whole end with that torn top.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
I already read it. Harry left a copy at the house.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
You thought I was faking?
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
You don't act like it?
You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
What money?
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coast Guard North Island Station. Over and out.
Maureen.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.
How long to fix?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Right.
I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
Some charts. A crew manifest.  Looks like her last voyage was January 1953. The question is where the hell's she been since.
You think she's sailing without a crew?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Only way to be.
Epps.
Same. Any luck?
February first.
Collision? With what?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Showing you what?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
If the weather holds it might not be so bad.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
I wish I could believe that. Either way, you know what I've done. I've got no choice.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Sorry.
Supposing he wants to get bad with us?
Maybe.
Drink up then.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
You've been out for about a day.
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Who?
Guess.
How should I know?
Yup.
What?
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Well, yes...
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
Hi.
Yeah, well... hi...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Why not?
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
What? Why?
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
In fact, never.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You can have that one.
You're better at it.
I'm going to tell him you said that.
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Fuck you, bitch!
Let's go hassle Josh.
Should we leave a note?
It'll only take a second.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
He does that every single day.
That rules!
But those are our people...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
I need to talk to you.
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
That's all you're bringing?
What time?
I dunno...
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
I love this place... it's so - you know, "funky."
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Hey, where are you going?
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
PLEASE? We have to!
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
I'm not holding my breath in that department.
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Yeah, right, I'm a klansman - thanks a lot!... Do you know the Cook's Chicken franchise?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
I... I don't think so.
What's up?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
What about this?
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
I'm just being realistic.
I hate sports.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I mean... of course I... why wouldn't I want to go out with you?
Yeah, well I like you too...
What?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
What do you want?
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
Right.
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
Did she say that?
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
You think so? Fine.  It's best you get out. Go. Tell all your people to go, run home where they'll be safe under the covers and when the bridge is built and the railroad is done, they can tell their women that out of all the thousands who worked here, they were the only ones to flee- 
As are they all.
-that's ridiculous talk and you can't seriously believe it-
We'll have to make them come to us, won't we? And since there are two of them, we're going to set two plans in motion.  First: we must move the entire hospital by tomorrow night.
Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched you confided in me.  But I don't really give a shit about your upcoming litter. I've made you with this assignment-  -don't make me break you.
What have they done besides kill Starling?  How many have they killed? 
I made a mistake hiring you- you're simply not up to the job. 
Well, he got away, didn't he?  Riding a donkey not far from here when the lion sprang on them- donkey took the brunt of it- then suddenly the lion ran off.
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I've got medical supplies to deliver. Come along to the hospital when you're done. 
So that's what a lion looks like. 
That's what the books say... 
Actually, no.
You think they'll come then?  Why?
Why?
Actually, I could have done it much more easily without you, but for whatever reason, I'm glad you came. 
Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly.
Clearly you don't agree about building the railroad?
Fine. Get started. And a strict curfew- no one allowed out at night.  Send half your men to the bridge, the rest with these two.  And I'm sorry for my tone earlier. But I repeat- there is no reason for fear. I will kill the lion and I will build the bridge.
I feel the same about the bridge. This country certainly didn't ask for it, doesn't need it.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
You know, you are really doing very good work here.  I think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
Good night, Janosz.
We don't have a relationship.
I'd rather not.
I'm not saying you did.  In science we always look for the simplest explanation.
I won't.
I don't know what to do anymore.
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
Okay, but it's not a date.  It's a dinner.
All right, you want to be real?  So tell me why did you dump me?
Thank you.  If I had that kind of support on a daily basis, I could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
So what?  It's a free country.  Thanks, Lib.
Peter, do you think maybe I have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
I know.
Then why have you come?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
Do I?
I'm a dermatologist.  I can't write orders on the psych ward.
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
Finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
Roach breeding?  Sounds better and better.  Dana?  The boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  Egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  Should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
This is about as deep as you can go under Manhattan without digging your own hole.
Nine feet -- ten --
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Nothing.  Just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  But we did turn up some interesting stuff on this Vigo character you mentioned.  I found the name Vigo the Carpathian in Leon Zundinger's Magicians, Martyrs and Madmen.  Listen to this:
I'll get one more reading.
She's new in town.
Huh?  What?
You finished here?
Look, Zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
I was just going to say "eight."  You're fantastic!
Are you sick, Louis?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I'm innocent!  Honest, Dana.  I never touched you.  Not that I remember anyway.
It's in the stars.
I know.  It happened by itself.
Thanks.  Coming from you that really means a lot to me.
Don't scream.
No kiss?
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I want you inside me.
But why?  The students love us!
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
I wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
I collect spores, molds and fungus.
Thank you.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
The magic word is "please."
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
The wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
When you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Oh, shit!
Looked at with your eyes.
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Great!  The marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
Right.  And the sky would fall ...
I want every single thing that belonged to my father out of this house!  If it's worth something then sell it!
You're coming back?
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
I am their hero!
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
He must have been.  He was on the list of prisoners to be executed.
I don't know...
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
There's no reason to say that. Everyone knows you're going to be well.  I had Servis groom your horse for a triumphal visit to the front at first light.
So I understand.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
What deal?
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
Before they leave, get gold.
Are you going to graduate school?
No -- why should I?
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Okay.
Oh my God --
But you're not enrolled.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
I don't understand --
What did she say?
Let me go.
But you might.
I have to go back now.
Yes.
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
I just don't think it would...
Yes.
No.
Thank you.
Not exactly.
Yes.
Well here's the purse.
Where are you?
Where are you?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What?
Ahh -- thank you.
A single. Just for myself, please.
Of course.
It's down the hall.
Is what a girl?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
What?
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Will you unzip my dress?
I know that. But I'm --
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Jesus Christ!
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Yes.
A drink? Of course.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
Well -- do you want to go up first?
Yes.
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Why don't you watch?
What?
Okay.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
No.
I don't.
I don't remember.
There!
What?
Him?
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Right.
Thank you.
Is it?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
What?
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
Not particularly.
Kind of.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
I don't think we were the first.
Really. I want to know.
No.
Let's drop it.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
I wouldn't know.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Did I say that?
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Then give me your word you won't.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
Go home now.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
No. She doesn't know about it.
Swell. I appreciate it.
What?
Quite a while.
Oh yes.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Great.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
That's quite a statement.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
I'd like to discuss this.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Have you got that skeleton key?
Why?
How?
No -- no -- no -- no...
You can't.
You might find a bullet through that head...
Really?
All right. We'll dance.
Money.
Yes --
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Nothing -- only to be here.
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And -- and --
How tired you are!
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
Go away. Who are you --?
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I don't want them now.
I --
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Till then.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
I've no luck.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.  It's good, -- come along, Baron.
All of that at once, Baron?
Oh -- good evening, Baron.
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
As you will.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.   Stay here... Give me that money.
Good heavens. What for?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
What?
Tired?
Moreover...
Perhaps. 
I understand you perfectly.
Well?
Of course -- of course. 
Oh, yes.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Good morning, Madam.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Go away -- go away.
Me?
-- We must do something...
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
I know -- I know.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
Well -- gentlemen.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Pretty as a picture.
Did I buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I want to keep my teeth.
Bobo, no, I --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug for me.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Right in front of the room.
Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Henry, no!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
One of those computer geniuses, isn't it?
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
Roy Dillon.
Just myself.
Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
You always did.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Sure.
Well, that's good news.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
Well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the track or the hot spots and Bobo's boys will be all over you.
I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
No.
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Joe, you know you'll --
We'll work something out, Joe.
You called the doctor, huh?
Oh, yeah?  Thanks.  How long do they say I'm in here?
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
You ain't seen nothin.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Sure. I'm pretty tired myself.
I saw her.
You must have some very knowledgeable friends.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
But the setup's there. It's there now.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
Explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
Yes.
The door was open, so we let ourselves in.
Do I know you?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
You sure?
Nothing.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
What?
You're right.  It does sound strange.
He's my brother.
You think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
Can't you hold it?
I'll pop a Benadryl.
Oh, they're so stupid... I'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
You're so easy...
Oh, don't be such a victim.
Reality check, dillweed.  This is 1995.
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
But they're gonna light the tree in a few minutes --
The voice man!  He's here!
Found this morning.  In a field outside Haddonfield.  Stabbed.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
Jamie's baby ...
Stay away, Sam.
Home is important to a man.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
I'm liable to find anything!
You know what gets me?
Good night, Colonel.  It's been beautiful.
Months?
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
You told me.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
That's against the law, isn't it? I can't wear a uniform anymore.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
I don't think so.  It could have been.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Is Penelope in?
For seven and a half of those years we were heavily drugged--or we would have been home long before now, believe me.  We were saved from starvation by the Lupi-Loopo Indians, who fed us a strange blue soup.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
We got to get another pilot.
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're my buddy.
Are you--
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
They were in the same creative writing class.
Sir?
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
The smallest thing I've got.
Gee whiz, Dad--
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Situation.
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Ram it up your ass!
People don't use that word any more.
More nerve than the doctor, I must admit.  He hasn't been home for two days.  Has he suddenly lost interest in sleep and color television--and the violin?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
He's afraid of you, Harold.  He knew you'd want to fight him.  He doesn't know anything about fighting.  He hates pain.
Action!  Interaction!  Give and take!  Challenge and response!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
You're begging him to kill you?
Honor, I suppose.
Don't!
Then listen to me.  You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride.  I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl!  You fool, you fool.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
You have chills?
I've never heard of it.
More and more we find ourselves laying aside false pride and looking into the pharmacopoeias of primitive people.  Curare, ephedrine--we've found some amazing things.
That's an editorial we, of course. I haven't turned up anything personally.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Correct.
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
And terror, if you don't mind.
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
If you're at home in the ooze, and nowhere else.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
I put a poisoned thought in your head.  Even now that poison is seeping into every lobe of your mind.  It's saying, "Obsolete, obsolete, obsolete," and, "Clown, clown, clown."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Was I ever of use?
You'd be killing a friend.  Don't you know how much I like you?
No!
Leave the rifle here.
So that's it! "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." Everybody was yelling "Kestenbaum, Kestenbaum." I thought it was some foreign language.
Who's dead?
Something's made you sore.
Stay home tonight!
He's a ghost!
Not true.
A lot of people don't.
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
What?
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
My father!
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
Women are always late.  You'll find out.
The park!
I'm sorry.
Well--it was nice while it lasted. Thanks for the memories.
No doubt Paul thinks it stinks.
Wear a coat of domestic mink.  For the love of God, though, Penelope, don't lightheartedly advertise that the last of the jaguars died for you.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
The what?
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
Goodbye.
Maybe God has let everybody who ever lived be reborn--so he or she can see how it ends.  Even Pithecanthropus erectus and Australopithecus and Sinanthropus pekensis and the Neanderthalers are back on Earth--to see how it ends. They're all on Times Square--making change for peepshows.  Or recruiting Marines.
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
You bet! "The Harold Ryan Fan Club." Pink, eh?  With a yellow streak up the back.  We got very good tailor shops up here.  They'll make you any kind of uniform, any kind of sweatsuit you want.  Judas Iscariot--he's got this black jacket with a skull and crossbones over the heart.  He walks around all hunched over, and he never looks anybody in the eye, and written on the back of his jacket are the words, "Go take a flying--
You sure? We have regular sessions, too. Only twenty dollars?
Two officers have been assigned to the case. I can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
What?
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
I was told there was a real nice girl here named Joanne. Quite young.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Pavonine. It's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
Overpowering?
You know her?
Tod might know.
How much do you make a week, Niki?
When do we start?
Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let's just talk for a while. Then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
You won't keep growing at this rate.
'Sucking off.'
No. But does it make any difference?  How did you get to be the way you are?
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
Yeah, yeah, go on.
It's not quite the same thing.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
So then, Mr. Mast...
Let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
Mast?
It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
Why don't you tell me something for a change?
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
I'll come with you. Let me pack some things.
You don't want to know.  Now, Wes, leave, please. For me.
She's got a man. A white guy. Tod something or other.
Yeah.
I want to meet Ratan.
Who told you about this?
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Not exactly...
To his own daughter?
To anybody.
You don't have to get uppity with me, Bill. I remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. And what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.
Was he with a girl?
Yes.
Isn't this your vehicle?
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
We planted it.
Is this your shovel?
Check.
Wait here.
Lady! Be quiet.
Well, not all the southwest. Although we do have a large business... Barley was very big last week...  Fifteen hundred...
What do you see?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Your hearse?
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
Oh, look! The birds.
No.
Me! No. Of course not.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Well...
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
But we can't just dig it up!
Thank you.
What were you fighting for?
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Okay.
With Life.
Yodeling?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
But they have.
Well, don't go.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Why?
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
Oh, Harold. 
Not now, Harold...  You can't put me down for Monday?
Fay, I'll call you back.  What did you say?
What?
I don't care what people say.
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
Why?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
You liked your teachers?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
The moment of truth.
Yes.
Souvenirs?
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Time to play.
Oh, I do. I do.
No. You look...
I know.
It's coming.
The Boxes. In the House. I told you.
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Finish what?
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
It's been Hell.
Steve...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
See what??
It doesn't say --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Is it bad?
The day Abraham Lincoln died. Hence "Abe" Sapien.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
Manning says I'm too soft on you --  The candy. Give him the candy.
"Myers", huh? You have a first name??
We're on the move.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Noooo! Noooo!!!
I knew those men better than you did --
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Alone?
No. Not this time, H.B. It's been months since I've had an episode. And you know what? I'm learning to control it.
Goodnight.
Good.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
Cocky.
Coffee's warming me up.
You solved the box. We came. Now you must come with us. Taste our pleasures.
No tears please. It's a waste of good suffering.
I could lead you right to him. You could take him back to Hell instead of me.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Oh Christ.
You remember.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
One last time. Give me the box.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
Oh.  Oh yes.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Tell me who you are.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
You're still afraid.
Yes. They'll never find us.
Then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
What's the problem?
Oh my God.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Shit.
No you won't.
Anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
I'll be down in a minute
I don't know where to begin...
Plain soda?
No personal details?
We don't need a bed, do we?
What's wrong?
I found a room.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
I love you too.
Really?
What?
I AM house-trained.
Not that late.
Yeah, there's room. And there's Julia.
We're not all frigid.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
No, it's good to see you.
Can I lend you a hand?
What things?
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
To me, it would mean that you're a liar.  You saw it twice.  Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick.  We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
You're not even coming?
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The."  But I could be wrong.
You'd love it!
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
Oh.  Okay.
Pardon me?
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Nice friend.
Fuck!  I knew it!  You're going through one of those what-does-it- all-mean things.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
'Course I will, Rob.  No problem. No problem at all.  I'll tell him next time I see him.
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously.  Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle  playing at Lounge Ax tonight.  I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good.  So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
Well stay for tonight, then.
My house?
Just the obvious stuff.
What, what?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
It sounds stupid.
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
I'm not -- hold on...
Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
You're also an idiot.
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
No, but...
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
Ha.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
Just local, of course.
We took care of that.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I don't know.
Nor have you!
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
That way.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Well call her mother.
And after that?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Fine.
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
Naw.  Those are for us.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
It's my birthday.
Thanks.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
Carl Smith.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Anything in Maryland is close.
Yes.
You have an active imagination.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
You?
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
I see.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
I'd like you to try.
That's insane.
I didn't kill the watchman.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Be careful.  Don't stay any longer than you have to.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Life is only life when it is bounded by death.  The inheritance is death. The gift is the finality of life. To be part of the fabric.  The inside.  I love you Brenna.
Yes.
Don't they have enough for you to do at the castle?
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What do you want from me?
What were you doing in Felton?
Why?
Aye.
I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation.  And a solution.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
Does it change with me in the room?
You are still so very young.
Go to hell.
But why be so concerned about me?
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
Of course.
You are young, inexperienced.  You do not know what time can do.  How it can sap all pity, all love.
Live?  In less than a week you're prancing about the country like a squirrel.
I'll not take that kind of talk from you.  From those others below, maybe.  But not from you.
Romirez is dust.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
It can be different.  It must be.
Either you are with me or against me.
Yeah.
You're wrong.
My quarry grows clever with age.  And the others, incompetent.
Of sorts.
Leave her alone.
Get up.
I want you to come to me.
Yes.
They were Steven, they were.  It's been a miracle it has.  He lasted right through and healed.  No one in the village has ever seen anything like it.  Ever.
Sure take after him.  Never seen a father and son look more alike.
I'll send them right up.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
What's the idea of locking this?
Open this door!
No. Roy. Roy V.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
Hello, Bruce...
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Hello, Hildy!
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I notice you still remember it.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
No, I can't.
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Dead?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
I'm not working for any other paper!
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Thanks...
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Now you got me.
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
No kidding, Hildy.  Say, this isn't a rib?
I'd like to think.
I get it!
Huh!
Call him a love-child, if you want to.  Duffy!
Where's Bruce?
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Was she? Did you notice?
Duffy!!!!   Duffy!!!!  Well, where is Duffy?  Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  Louie.
What is it? Here!
Where'd you wire him?
Who do you want?
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them.  We've got to get this desk out of here.
They can't do that to me!
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Beats king up.
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
Now, where is he?
I can't complain.
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
That's good, because my health ain't what it used to be.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
An attempt to ruin us!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Five hundred dollars.
You'll take fifty and like it!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
Huh?
That's good.
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
Don't move!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Get the Governor on the phone!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
How much do you make a week?
Huh?
Forty dollars.
For heaven's sake, why not?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Henry Chapman's daughter. It was Sheila. I remember her from last year.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I know.
But Grandpa, you said...
Who told you that?
Do you know any swear words?
Could.
Liar. Mummy keep still and Daddy moves on top of her. That's what they do when they know how.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
Thanks, son. I can hear it. I'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
Please yourself.
Weeds will grow, Mac.
You joined up.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Up to six weeks, I think.
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
OK.
Well, yeah, kind of.
He left!
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Fucking great.
I don't.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I thought she tried to murder a witness for the prosecution.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
Then the devil says, "are you gay?" Guy says, "fuck no"... Devil says, "Well then, I guess you're gonna hate Thursdays."
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
You're a real fucking piece of work.
Didn't look like chicken to me, more like fried pussy cat.
That food...  ugh, I feel like I'm gonna puke.
There's a dog in the road.
Quiet.
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
You seen this girl? Say... within the last 24 hours.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
No dear, I'm fine. Now what kind of host would I be if I put my guests to this kind of work.
Oh yeah, murder museum... sounds fun.
That seems likely.
Blah, blah, blah... it doesn't say, but she was released sometime in 1937, only to reappear as Ellie Bogdan, the arm-less wonder. Says she, "criss-crossed the United States constantly in carnivals and freak shows until her death in 1946."
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Tell me about it.
Yeah, hey how far do you think we are from your Dad's?
I still don't.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Oh, you mean on TV.
Aw, honey you know I can't do that.
Enough with the stupid voices.
I know the words... fucking psycho fucking bullshit, that's the words.
Oh, you are very welcome... Lord knows how I love a man in uniform.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
No, not really. Good kid, never been in any trouble.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Right.
Your Spidey senses tingling.
Aw, fuck.
Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
Oui.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Shh.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Stop. Get away.
What for?
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?
Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous.
I don't know. Something's missing.
I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
No biggie.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
You do?
I like you, too, Nathan.
I don't care. I don't care!  Like what, for example?
Do you?
I love you so much.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
I'm just preoccupied.
Sure. Of course.
Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.
How come?
Such as what womanly things?
Should I come with?
Ummm. It's good.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Oook. Oook.
Ooka.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Lila?
Even better.
It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really?
No.
Yes?
Right.
It's open...  What'll you have?
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Well, nobody has to sell.
How?
Cash.
Yeah. Sure, sure.
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
I never saw you do anything else.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
When do I raise the bet?
I don't know.
Well, here it's half.
Who's he?
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Whaddya mean?
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Give me a drink, will ya?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
I told you you'd get your money back.
Oh yeah? Where?
Okay?
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired.  And beat.
Who's he?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
Shoot.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Call it.
Yeah, I'm quittin'.
Eight o'clock.
Can I buy you another drink?
How come you didn't catch your bus?
I'm not.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
No. I'll take you home.
Okay. So what's your name today?
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
Thanks.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Raw.
I got beat up. They...  They broke my thumbs.
I love you.
I feel pretty.
First time for everything.
Come here. Come on, now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks.  Here, you hold it.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Nine ball.  Three ball.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
You watch me.
It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
My wife.
I only protect myself -- !
Humans.
I don't know.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I surrender --
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
Okay.
What did it look like?
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
I was so scared.
Yes, Mr. Gardner.
I understand, Miss, that you have my son in your office.
They didn't find any signs of life on the Viking missions.
This is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
I take it you've heard.
Love was never our problem.
Then get them out of there.
It was turned on. I was ignoring you. What's the big emergency?
What's the bad news?
And the good news is you won't charge me.
Just do it!
Not really...
A countdown to what?
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Three years.
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
You try Martin?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
Better than we thought.
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Really? Ballet?
Oh. Sorry.
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
You're gonna break it. Just leave it alone. Here, take your medicine.
If we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an America left to defend.
I said call them back.
Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
Air... water... your "sun."
And before here?
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
And I am his.
The dog!?  You are named after the dog...
Yes. My treat.
It's today's mail. And it's been opened.
What is it?
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
The Name of God...
You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
How dare he?!
You could be more right than you know.
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
Don't call me that, please.
I'll never forgive myself --
He was actually there? You saw him?
I'm out, Dad!
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
There is more in the Diary than just the map.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
But what are they? Can't you remember?
Marcus would agree with me.
I was the next man.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
When?
Fly... yes. Land... no.
You call this archaeology?
Get out of there, Dad!
A long time to wait.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
But, Indy --
They have them. In the belly of that steel beast.
Of course. Admittedly, it's taken time. Britain's controlled India for almost two hundred years now.
No, he's a very shrewd old boy. Power behind the throne and all that. He actually runs this whole province.
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
You should have been there...
No? Well, I guess he just hasn't met the right woman...
I am only his humble servant, but the Maharajah usually listens to my advice.
There are no stories anymore.
I think that's enough of this nonsense, Dr. Jones...
And didn't the Sultan of Madagascar threaten to cut your head off if you ever returned to his country?
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Why?
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
They came from Palace and took sivalinga from out village.
I'm sorry, I don't know how I can help you here.
Siam.
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
A snake!
It's curling around me! Damn it, stop talking and do something!
Can you move your arm?
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
Maybe...
He said he couldn't take us any farther. He has to go sell the elephants.
I can't find any lever! Help me Indy!
Yes.
So now they believe me.
You didn't do so well yourself. Finding that stone could've gotten you all the fortune and glory you were talking about.
What is your name?
Then how'd I get here?
What for?
Hear voices don't I.
Yeah JOE Why there's a little man in my head?
If I'm real, they'll get me out. If I'm not, they'll treat you. Either way you'll be better off than you are now. You'll get a reward.
He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Then what are you stopping for?
I did. I brought you back here.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
I'm not leaving until you do.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
See the codelock? Punch this in. 26993
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
I can't remember..
Gone where?
You can't go home. When UST finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
Not who. A data bank. Just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
You are not alone. But you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
We get on which plane?
Well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
Little late for that.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
I don't want to eat it.
Follow it.
She doesn't seem to understand.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Wait.
No...you idiot!
To the hotel. To register.
Without your pants.
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
That's a big if.
I don't know what's going on.
...I've lost something. I must get it back.
Maybe she's telling the truth.
It's not your time. I get time off.
You found her.
Osaka.
On what?
That's not funny.
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Relax. Let me do this.
I can't see a thing.
Never mind, just say it.
I don't trust her.
Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
Don't worry, I can.
Ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. Looks like all they need is the chip.
What exactly?
You've changed your mind.
You're lovely.
That's nice.
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Let us get to the border!
What a nerve!
Rene?
You have nothing...
Bit expensive, sir.
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
He's...more. Somehow, enhanced... He's...zxflbbgt!
That name's familiar.
Fine. You look fine.
Not you. Them.
I don't know Who.
I noticed you staring.
A little voice in my head.
Whatever it is, don't do it.
What's what?
I didn't say anything.
Where?
Let you leave without it.
...Rene.
You're doing...Okay.
Who do you work for?
Why didn't you tell me?
Last night?
He must be a good friend.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
Get us one.
What?
I know the territory.
Nothing we can do.
Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
We just don't stop.
If he was able, what would he say.
Why are you on to him?
Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Thanks.
It will be fine. You have another.
Ahhh...Okay?!!!
Poor bastard.
Mom.
Get me Wigand.
Sure.
Good.
Maybe later.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
Hey, Lowell.
Okay. 
Our standards have to be higher than anyone else's, because we are the standard... for everyone else...
Call me back in ten.
Right now?
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
"60 Minutes"?
I'm alone on this...
You're not listening.  Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
...you fucked me!
No. No, it's okay... How's -- how's the new place?
Alright.
That's right...
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
All right. See you...
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
I think it was a disgrace.
Yeah, that's right.
I see a rhetorical question on the horizon.
Like what? Corporate responsibility? What, are we talking celebrity here?
Far as you go where?
This issue is a drop in the bucket. I can talk to you about what's in here. But I can't talk to you about anything else.
Did work.
I'm Lowell Bergman. We spoke on the phone, remember?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco... they got up in front of Congress that time... it was on television...
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
Why?
I don't think you really understand --
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
They do this with impunity!
Did you have a good day?
Run that Sandefur piece on "nicotine's not addictive." Run that on-camera. Then cut right to Wigand with "I believe they perjured..." Then go wide to the CEOs all taking the oath. Back on Jeff and play the pause after the word "felt" on the B-side...
What?!
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
Everything... you... say! And I can't defend you, man, with one hand tied behind my back! Because you keep from me... what they can discover. And they will discover everything! Believe me.
What?
You greased the rails!
What?
For example. James Burke, the CEO of Johnson & Johnson... when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in Tylenol bottles, he didn't argue with the FDA... He didn't even wait for the FDA to tell him. He just pulled Tylenol off every shelf of every store right across America. Instantly. And then he developed the safety cap... Because, look, as a CEO, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? But he's also a man of science. He's not going to allow his company... to put on the shelf... a product that might hurt people.  Not like the Seven Dwarfs...
What do you mean followed you? Did you call the police?
Well, what do you really think, though?
You're gonna get your fix...
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I had no idea until after, but --
Excuse me?
Uh... poetry recitation.
I don't need it.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
What is it you're after, Miles?
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
So I hear. Is that all?
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
She never particularly cared for me.
She held that against you?
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have "things."
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Please! Leave the house.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
We are. And it's winding down.
Marylin.
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
He was right, wasn't he?
Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how Jean Harris made it work for her.
But you're going through with it?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
Well, that's about to change big time.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
Nothing?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
And she has...?
What the fuck...?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said --  "When I grow up, I want to be divorced."
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Yes, sir?
"I found a million dollar baby—"
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
I might.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
You only met him once .
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
Please don't shout.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
No.
I'd like to have a talk with him.
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Yes, of course.
What do they say?
All right, let it go.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Are you talking to me?
What am I going to do now?
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
No. I'd rather you didn't.
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
My ticket?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Where is the shower?
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
Why, haven't you—?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women.  How do you expect to get there?
know—but—
I don't want it now.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Oh, no!
Clever.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
Come on—get in.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Ain't gonna wait a minute.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Oh, excuse me. 
I said, the old man's screwy!
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Get out!
What's the thousand bucks for?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's she gonna marry?
I am, Joe.
Now I know you're drunk.  I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Okay, pete. 
Yeah.
But what in the world do they want a trumpet for?
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you?  To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is—"  No, do you really?
Zeke.  Git!
What's the idea?
Say, Buddy–
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Not one word.  That's an order.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
When did you first do business with this Bertrand?
You knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know.  He had command of the king's English.
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
Chief, maybe you had a little too much to drink.
I couldn't be more serious, Jack. Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty.
Your boss got a serious problem, Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's been going on at your office
You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking as a friend now.  You're riding on the Titanic.  Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison.
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Yeah, what's the big mystery? Everybody down here knows the guy.
Go on, Willie.
The anonymous kind, Chief.
When something's rotten in the land, Bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias.  Start checking around the Quarter.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
I think we should have him in for a little talk.
Yeah.
Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - he was afraid of dying, then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace, but he leaves two unsigned suicide notes.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
I don't know.  Were you?  Who you scared of, Dave?
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
There were admirals.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62?
I know.
No.  Never heard of him.
A Perry Russo?
No, I don't believe I know anyone by that name.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance.
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am an international businessman.  The Trade Mart which I founded is America's commercial pipeline to Latin America.  I trade everywhere. I am accused, as are all businessmen, of all things.  I somehow go about my business, make money, help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world.
But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission.
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.
I don't know what to tell them.  How 'bout the truth - I'm doing my job to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice won't be an arcane, vanished idea they read about in history books, like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis.
It's going to get worse, honey.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
That means we gotta subpoena Time- Life on it.
The Warren Commission call him?
Allen Dulles?
Boss, then I'm afraid I can't continue working with Bill.
Are they?  Why would they?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.  What can I do for you?
It never did. 
Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't have time for this nonsense.  We've obviously got the bastards worried now.  I'm going to Washington.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
How many men are working with you on this?
That's it.
I understand.
Yes, Max, I understand.
Who was there for your ass?
Who?
And you didn't tell the Police?
Ever heard of a fella named Beaumont Livingston?
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Can you do it or not?
Who do you think I am?
I thought you might want a drink?
I'd love one, but not there.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
What's your brand?
I am, as a matter of fact.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
Black's fine.
Are you?
Why?
You know, I can't really feel too sorry for you in that department.
What'd ya see?
Well, I'd never be so bold as to speak for all men, but as or myself and a few of my friends, that's definitely the case. There's a lot of actresses out there you like, and there's some you have crushes on. But there's always one who you love. And with her it's sorta like going steady.
Sandra Bullock. You know her?
I don't care.
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
Uh-huh.
Did you tell him you were leaving?
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I never lied to you.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Who's side are you on?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
And splittin' with her?
Uh-huh.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
Si.
You'd take a polygraph on it?
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
What about me?
What about you?
Uh-uh.
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Talk to you tomorrow.
If you want.
No, I give it to someone else first.
So we need two people, two women.
I got the woman covered. Where you thinkin' about doin' this?
Managers get ten percent.
I need to talk to you alone.
I was there, I saw her do it.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Susanville.
Bank robbery.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
Sure.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
All right already.
Are you sweating?
You sure?
This one.
You sure?
What's your cost?
What do I do?
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
That was Beaumont.
You didn't even hafta say it. I know the woman.
What does that mean?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
Uh-huh.
You said five hundred and fifty!
The fitting room. It went down exactly the way it was supposed to.
If she's got it, why didn't she take it all?
I don't know. Either she has it or the Feds.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
I got some more business for ya.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Beaumont worked for you.
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
Well, give it to me then.
I'd like to hear that too. Turn around and put your hands on your head.
My ass be dumb, but I'm not a dumbass. Go sit over there on the couch.
Yeah.
No.
You better be, motherfucker.
You know it's for you.
Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they're new.
Give me his home number.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No, thanks.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
No, don't. But thanks.
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
What do you want from me?
You see this line here? It's your life line. Here's where you were born. And this is where you got married. You're a married man, huh? Oh oh. Nope. Divorce. See this split.
Just my luck.
It's cold.
Used you?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
But the paper ...
I saw Sarah the other day.
Who?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm walking, aren't I?
No.  I see them.
Yes.  I don't want them. I'm not looking for analysis or drugs. It's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  It's more than that. I can feel it. I need you Prof. You're the only one I can talk to.
What's your name?
I'm not cold.
Of course not. You have all the blankets. It must be ten degrees in here. I'm telling you, Sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. From now on that window is closed.
Where'd you leave 'em?
They're weird names.
And look what I got.
Why you left.
She looked good then.
Gabe.
I don't like things that make you cry.
How's it going?
I enjoy crushing into you.
Why do you bring her up?
Where?
Lie down!
With wings. You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
While you were in the shower.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Sit down, Jake.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage.  Where'd you go today?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
Just relax.
Yeah, you and everyone else.
Push 'em back.
We're not going to hurt you.
Of course it is. What else could it be?
Paul Gruneger!
Nothin' much.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
That black car?
What's goin' on Paul?
I don't know.
Yeah.
I don't know what to do.
What do you mean?
You've seen them?
Last month, before Thanksgiving.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
We don't have a choice!
Delongpre! Out of time!
Yeah, yeah.  Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
Kkinsa! Open the doors!
Where'd you get the gun?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Where is he?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
Oh man, what the hell happened?
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab.
Guys!!! The shuttle?
What if we don't?
You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh? You must have been a very lonely girl.
Wait around on your asses all day.  I'll need a distraction.
Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
Well, do something!
Just get us to the ship!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Crutch?
Barbie from hell...
You killed him?
Ssh.
Alright, I'm . . .  No way . . . is this a joke?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
More soldiers?
What have I done?! Idiots.
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
Sure but what good will that do?
On the swing? I told you not to play near there until I sanded it down.  See what your son did?
I'm authorized by the township of Amity to hire you as an independent contractor. We'll meet your price. $10,000.
You got it.
Nobody. We're drifting with the current.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
I almost had 'im.
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
He's taken him!
He's sitting in it.
Michael! Come inside!
I'll see you back soon. There's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks, and there's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit.
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
My kids were on that beach...
No, it was local jurisdiction.
It wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or Jack the Ripper. It was a shark. It was a shark.
You could say that.
How can you tell?
He ate a car?
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there.
Just keep kicking.
Pretty stiff.
Doctor, you're the one who told me what it was!
You love sharks?
Yep.
We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning, Mayor. Fatal. Gotta batten down the beach.
C'mon, it'll give us time to think about what they're going to say.
-- and an America's Cup Trials...
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. He was born with what he does best. Eat. He's a swimming appetite. 'Course he might eat this stuff, but then I've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.  Next time, ask me.
It ain't a Big Mac.  The expert don't approve. What do you thing? You're closer to the situation. 
What do you see?
I think I can top that, Mister...
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
I'm pregnant.
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
Well, I do.
We could get back together too.
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Yup.
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. It's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Wow, dream big!
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Oh.
When was this, like '96?
You weren't even alive!
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there.
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
You're something else.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Nope. We're safe.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Vanessa, right?
Then what's going on?
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Yeah, she does.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Dad, no!
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
You're not listening to me.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What do you make with that?
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
And I disagree.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Have you found a place to stay?
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
That French ain't it?
...Yeah.
Yeah.
Jeez... Adele!
Early, sing me a song.
I don't know. Wish I did.
Vernon, Florida.
...Too bad.
This guy killed a mess of people.
...just like that?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
Fuck!
Take your time.
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Why, what did he do?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Then try again, 
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Where would we find him?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
Hell yeah. Fuckin' starvin'. Wait up a sec.
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
You think?
It is right.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
No, I'm serious man. I'm dead ass. Do you wanna try? We could be like the fuckin X-rated "Wonder Twins"!
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
She was handing out those watermelon slices. And I sat down over on the other side, And I watched her.
Yeah.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
Bet.
Yeah. Why you give money.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
Yeah, good luck. I mean what the fuck. The guy had no legs.
Shut the fuck up.
I don't know. How much do you want?
Casper, where's Telly.
Nothen' B.
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yeah. Come on.
At the block party?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
I wouldn't believe it?
Well, I don't mean to be a pest. It was just that I was looking at you. And you look upset. I liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. And I was wondering if I could be of any assistance? Maybe I could cheer you up or somethin. Help make you happy. Who knows? Somethin' maybe.
Yeah, I guess so.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Am I getting warm?
Thanks.
Well then, I don't know. You know what you do then? You forget. Block it out. I remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother told me to be happy. She said. She said, "Leon, my darling little grandson. If you want to be happy don't think. Don't bump into any walls. If you stutter. Don't talk" And I took her advice. And look at me now. Couldn't be happier.
Is Telly there? This is Paul. Who is this?
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I know.
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
I'm not sure. He said something about meeting Darcy. I think he likes her now.
Because he can like climax you up to that...
Oh shit.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah I get bored.
You think so?
That's right.
It's grandmother style.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
Get off me!
Sit down!
No.  She just moved here last month from Portland.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
You think he's dirty?
Anything?
What was suspicious about him?
I haven't got time for this.
The game's almost over, Peter, and you're running out of time.
Very good.
Congratulations on your daring escape. You just missed me by a few seconds.  It's check, Peter.
The game's over.  You lost.
No.  As usual you're wrong.  It is her I want.  Killing you would be easy. Living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
I think your mother knows that now. Why don't you put the knife down.  Put it down, David.
Thanks.
Of course not.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
Why did he what?
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Boys.
Has he gotten through to any?
For what?
How long has she been dead?
Bingo.
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
It's important.
He moves around a lot.  Why?
That's a big area to cover.
What are you saying?  That I'm seeing what I want to see?  That I'm protecting a murderer?  What?
This stinks!  You want to know what I think?  I think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. You need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Answer the question.
I went out.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Exactly... and you did this.
No.
I can check and call you back.
It's alright.
Yes.
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Getting too hot in here for you?
How can you look at it so clinically?
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
Let's change the subject.
Very good.  Spoken like a true psychologist.  When confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  What is that Masters and Johnson?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.
And you?
You've got to face the things you feel.
I said I didn't plan on getting involved.
If I have to.  I'm going to take a shower.
Where's the note?
Can I come in?
You don't understand.
It's got to be grammatically correct.
I'm not nervous.
I don't have to go through with it either.
Thank you, but I can wait.
You have the power. <u>Will it</u>.
That way. I can feel the cold.
I must follow the Slayers. They've taken Lyssa.
Turold's son was to marry her.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
You must never know her name.  If more than one approaches, she will certainly kill them. Alone I may have a chance.
Lyssa, your bracelets. Bend them straight and cross them.
We must enter the swamp.
Yes. It is today.
Blast! A thousand miles off course. Well, I was rushed. There was a certain difference of opinion concerning a venison pie. The foolish man left it sitting on his windowsill. What did he expect?
That I promise you.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
Colwyn, don't be a fool. You can't do battle with that thing.
I ...  ... am Titch.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
And who is <u>he</u> that they should join <u>him</u>?
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
Yes.
You knew! You are a rude bumpkin!
Yes. It is the Western Ocean.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
She has the power of vision.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
Could not. Could not betray the girl to whom I was betrothed.
You had a son.
Where is he? My son.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
I was nervous, that's all! Where is the guy?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Why?
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...17.
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
I prefer waiting for a while...  I feel it would go the wrong way.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
Yes.
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
...Composer.
Huh, that's good!
Yes... Twice.
If you can't redo these six hundred miles when you're rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
Uncle, the way I was told, if that police car didn't happen down that road, you would be dead right now. That guy Denny, had jumped bail in another state, he's dangerous... They'll be other Dennys, if you don't plan.
I finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
I'm completing the walk.  I'm almost there.
Yes -- you are.
I've seen it before.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
Twenty miles?  I see.
What it is -- is the truth.
What do you want from me?  Would I swim across an ocean for you?... Would I walk across the United States for you?  Yes... Yes I would.  You know that.
There's no reason.
I think it's a different place for each person.
Did you have a dream?
Good.
From where?
I see.
That's a reasonable assumption.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
You tell stories?
Nine.
You know what -- that was a really good story... Tell it again.
What was that?
God damn, you're right... You don't say much Michelle, but what you say is golden.
You're amazing.
... The Grapes of Wrath.
I mean you've done a great thing. You should be rewarded monetarily.
What?  Who are you?
No.
Of course.
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
You do?
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
OK.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Be careful.
Can we just forget it?
I don't understand any of that.
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
Where are you staying?
Right here at the hotel. Why?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
I have a 4.0.
I can't tell you.
Are we done for today?
I saw Brooke standing over his body, drenched in his blood.
I guess.
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
So everything you just said --
No, she was crying her eyes out.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
I think so...
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
I am. And I'm looking at a beautiful, fabulous, sexy woman.
How'd it go at the trial?
Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
I'm her sister.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
You're kidding!
What?
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Yes, he is.
You guys are so sweet!
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
What?!
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have?
No, she can't move for an hour.
That's not really a topic that keeps me up at night -- but maybe it should.
What're you talking about? You earned it --
Then, forget it. Besides, I have an early class tomorrow.
I'm canceling the mixer. We'll blacklist Sigma Chi.
Where's Warner?
I can't believe you're a Laker Girl!
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
East coast people are different.
I told you, Elle. I need someone -- serious.
Sarah was my girlfriend at prep school. We got back together over the summer at my grandmother's birthday party.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
Where's the Rock?
Yeah, luckily.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Purely a precaution...
To finish last evening's delightful work.
You're magnificent.
Grotesque... monstrous...
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Oh, yes...
And then?
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Faerie ring?
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
What do I do?
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Aye.  Before the wee pesties attacked.
It doesn't matter.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Patience, lad.
He'll not escape me.
They'll do nicely.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
I may have said perhaps...
Liar!
Sport, indeed.
All right.  I'll show you something sacred.
Are you honest?
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Dead, dead, dead.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
And sweet?
You... you... you mortal you!
Please...
Be fair, Oona.
I think she's about to foal.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
I don't know.
Why?
Turn over.
It's freakish.  I don't get it.  I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
I'm not gay.
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
You'd hate him for the trick.
He's got a standing invitation.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Allowed outside the enclosed area.
If that's what it takes.
To the patio and one north-facing window...  And six inches to the height.
how much weight have you lost?
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
I'm not.
That's too long.
I'm sorry.
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
Mom...please.
I almost saw Catalina.
I warned you yesterday.
No.
You snore at night.  That bugs me.  Can I take you out?
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
My dad used to play a game.  I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
I like how it feels not to feel.
What would you like to be?
I'm telling you now.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
Good for you.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Can you build a house in four months?
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I want you to find someone for me.
Where is he?
When's school over?
Last time you were gone for a week!
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
The first and the last.
Sam's favorite.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
Finished or unfinished?
Oh...with his ear infection!
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
I think so.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
I'd rather you not be here.
Peter left me yesterday.
It's not my back that's killing me.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
Not a perfect day.
You got the money?
Who?
I'd be you.
Good.  That was the plan.  We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
Sam took them to a movie.
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Why?
What did you say?
Someone stop her!
Yes, it is.
Dad's home, already?
Is Mae Rose okay?
Crawford's are always looking for new talent.
But you can't.
At least the kid's getting out. Isn't this what you wanted?
But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is. Look, when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes, didn't I come through for you? Ain't she stepping in style now?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
He looks like he can take care of himself.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Why would you want to go home? It's so early.
Claude Banks.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
I can't wait to see that. You slay me, man.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
So you mean, if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running, I'd have to hype some square like you?
I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut.
Are you kidding? Tell me you don't want a slice of that pie right over there.
What gave you that idea?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
That jelly you were talking to right here?
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
What ain't there?
No, I don't like it here. Look around. There's nothing but ass. Male ass! Balls and ass! Believe you me, I'm getting out of here.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
What do you want, Claude?
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf --
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
You drew this?!
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
I know people.
Of course, he's in the lineup. There he goes right there. Hey, Babe...!
We're like his handlers. He can't function without us.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
Don't touch that car.
Then you're lucky I came along. Doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. Now help me out of this trunk.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
Don't call me soft, I hate it when you call me that.
Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day? More beautiful than any church I was ever in.
You're the one who said that boneyard's the only way we're getting out of here. We're gonna join all the rest of 'em soon enough. Jangle Leg, Biscuit, Goldmouth, Poker Face, Cookie, Radio -- yes sir, pick a plot and start digging...
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
It's too late for plans.
Why the hell not?
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
You kidding? I've been in and out of prison my entire life. Mostly in. I'm hard-core.
Creamed chip beef on toast. Except we're outta beef, so I had to improvise.
Made just for you, Cookie.
How about some steak sauce?
Listen up, jiggaboo! State of Mississippi ain't interested in your... in your...  metropolitan assets!
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
Do you realize what your saying, Gibson?
Yeah, it's special. They don't make 'em like this anymore.
Why, my wife gave it to me on our anniversary some years back.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's a long story...
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Comes up the Mississippi. I can get more. A lot more. I was thinking about going into business for myself, but under the circumstances, I'd be willing to take on a partner.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
She's so nice.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
How bad?
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
That's a pretty brassiere.
I started slow, though. For years, I was just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one, too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I'll take the soup.
That's nice, Grandpa. Why don't you just enjoy the fishing?
You're not saying it's up to me?
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Should we wake him up?
Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
The South.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
What are you doing?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
I have to, Valerie.
If it's Cassius, yes.
And if that is your so-called "flask," how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?
You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
You know about Sanctuary! I know you do! You have to help us! You don't have a choice! It isn't your decision!! Tell us.
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
Maybe, maybe not. What's the difference? Come on, Logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
Come on. I don't want to miss the filing-in. There'll be some I know tonight, I think...
I'm in my party mood.
No -- it's that last Runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
I'm Mary 2.
Where do you live, Mary?
Killed? Why do you use that word?
I never 'killed' anybody in my life. Sandmen terminate Runners.  Who brought you?
Thanks... but I have the choice.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
All right.
You know something.
Maybe you'll think of something...
You're not going, are you?
When did you begin to question Lastday?
But what is this -- why?
I -- I can't.
They won't believe us.
They won't listen.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
You're really one of us now, aren't you?
And yours.
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
I won't.
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
Of course.
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
Things change!
But there are so many of them. Do you know each one separately.
Yes...
"Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity, There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
My name's Holly... Holly 13. In ancient times they said my number was unlucky. Do you believe in luck?
What makes you think so?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
No, no, no
Never, never, ever. Nothing.
More... many more.
Logan-5... Francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. Intrusion accidental.
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
No. Fred hates them.
Maid? Relative?
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Or something.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Okay...
No... no.
Pete... Don't...
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
In pornos?
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Andy?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Yes.
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
Yes, I believe so.
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.
You really don't remember the other night, do you?
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Same as always. Pete takes care of himself.
Out in back.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
No, sir, it's not.
When he went to work, right.
What about yesterday?
FUCKIN' "A".
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
What do you mean? You're where right now?
Alice who?
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
Same one you were reading the other night?
When you didn't come to the club.
Who the hell owns that dog?
Two detectives are coming out.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
No, it's nothin'... I'm all right.
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
I want you to ride with me. Somethin' doesn't sound right.
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
I'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
No. No, I don't.
What?
Sure.
You were acting like a different person.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I beg your pardon.
It certainly is.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Come on, Lovey.
Think of it! In times like these.
Oh, no - you don't want to go yet, honey.  She'll stick around too.  Is that right?
Yes, yes. They were very sincere about it too. You see, a perfect body in perfect health is the rule here. They've never known anything different. So what was true for them they thought would naturally be true for anyone else living here.
Mr. Chang, if you don't mind, I think I'll go on being amazed - in moderation, of course.
Why not? She's an attractive young woman.
Not for years. Shangri-La will keep her youthful indefinitely.
I've offered you some warm broth. I thought perhaps-
You shouldn't be looking at the bottom of the mountain. Why don't you try looking up at the top sometimes?
You may not know it, Mr. Chang, but right here you have Utopia.[15]
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
"Ungrateful fool . . . !"  Those were my very words to myself last night. "Here are these people in Shangri-La doing everything in their power to make our stay comfortable and happy and I haven't done one single thing to show my appreciation."
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Of course I have suspected that our being here is no accident. Furthermore, I have a feeling that we're never supposed to leave. But that, for the moment, doesn't concern me greatly. I'll meet that when it comes. What particularly interests me at present is, why was I brought here? What possible use can I be to an already thriving community?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
Shhh!
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I don't believe it! I can't believe it. She's lying.  You're lying. You're lying! Every word you've been saying is a lie! Come on, say it!
That fellow got on at Baskul.
We'll smash his face in. That's what we'll do.
Well, Mr. Conway, for a man who is supposed to be a leader, your do- nothing attitude is very disappointing.
hope you'll forgive me for—
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
Father Perrault. Of course I can't quite get used to this age thing.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
Why, mother?
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
You'll wait till you rot!
They don't.  Now, son.  If you get the job, you're going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  Here's a little piece of advice:    Don't use this so much.
Yes, sir.
Actually, sir--
Oh. Shit. it's in the car--
Oh yeah?  The hell you weren't. Little pither just out of school...
INS, Washington.  Special services.
Sir--
I know, but we're on a college campus...
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
Hold it.
Jeebs is eager to have me deport him. But would rather kill himself than go downtown. Why?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
The radio show?
I think that's what's happening...
We're rising.
Well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he's saying is true.
Right.  Oh, and here.
In case I need it.
You know, there's something we never really thought of...
Yeah, right.  Even I can barely read all my work.
With exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
What is it?
It would've had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
Actually... I don't know.
What if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
They respond to fear, right?
How could it not?
No-- a Person is smart.  People are dumb.    And the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  And you know that.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
I don't believe you, Mikey.  And you know why I don't believe you? Cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
Did he say where?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
What?
Agatha...
He won't.
What is it?
I can't leave.  You said so yourself, there is no Minority Report.  I don't have an alternative future.
The other two will die without me.
She died?
How did I not see this?  Agatha, who killed you mother?  Who killed Anne Lively?
Yeah --
How can I do what I do now?  Let's just say I spent a lot of time in the prison library.
How do I find the --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
Not to mention, "Saved by the bell".
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
I show a cop on horseback.
You don't have to chase me, Fletcher.
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
We keep a strict separation so that no one can accuse us of tampering.
The oracle isn't where the power is anyway.  The power's always been with the priests.  Even if they had to invent the oracle.
Nothing... she grabbed me, and then there was an image on the screen...
She said...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Come on!
I was looking for you...
I know that.  I know you would have done anything to find me.  I know you would have died for me.
He's alive?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
I'm... not... a... killer.
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I can't help you.  No one can.  The Precogs are never wrong.
He's dead, Lara.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Tell him not now.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Oh, it's all my damn business now, Lamar.  Investigation of a supervising office for a capital crime falls under federal jurisdiction... so as to rule out any possibility of conspiracy.  He's my suspect.
Not quite.
How?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
Yes.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
Right here.
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
I'm sure you've all grasped the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology.
We can stop him.
Knott!
Who?
So you haven't seen his apartment?
That was our apartment.
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
To what?  Trap him?
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
Snifter are for warm drinks --
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
See you later.
You girls aren't from Brooklyn or anything?
We used to take baths together.
Bullshit.
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
She's, uh, sleeping.
Where were you?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Look, man, I'm the bachelor, alright? I gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
She'll be out in a minute.
What's his name?
Shit.
Where is this happening?
No.
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
Yeah. The blaze. I bought her in '66. Hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. That horse made me over a hundred grand. In 'sixties' dollars. You know what that is today?
I don't understand.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
We get it. We're sorry.
Bobby.
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
Depends what night.
Ricky's taken care of.
Ruiz isn't here.
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
It's not losing record.
I'll page you.
Damn right, I have. You think I like living on fucking Yucca? We do a good job on this, we're in.
We'll kill Fairfax this year.
What are we delivering?
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
Seat belt.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
To keep?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
What's the movie?
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
No. Look. There.
Yeah, I guess.
Relax. You got one-fifty. You heard the guy.
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
What are you doing?
Relax. I'll do right by him. You know that.
I don't know.
Yeah, but you know Horrace. What did you get off him?
You fucking nuts?
You got that right.
Fuck you. Go then. I'm taking the car.
Yeah, I know how you do. I know how you do. I've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. You've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. How the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. How you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. Who wants to play 'Just the tip?' Dancing around like a smacked ass. Oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak English. 
He wants to see us now.
We're getting whacked.
You gonna shank him in the shower?
C'mon, man...
Yeah. Where they gonna whack us?
The what?
Did you hear what he just said?
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
How is it you're good? You on a list?
You look big, man. Diesel. You been lifting?
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yeah. Me and my boy here are gonna be in New York overnight. I want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I'm talkin' a California style, Tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. And make that drink a double.
So we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
I don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin Irish. You heard of the Westies?.
Coke?
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Yeah.
You'll love it.
So tell me how it is.
It's a digestif.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
You better not be. Cause if a cat toe you down in this town, you better stand up or make tracks.
Man's rep travels.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
Let 'em come. I'm ready.
What did you give it to me for then?
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
Man, you been locked up too long, everybody conks. All the cats.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
That's what Mama used to say.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
The first men on earth were black. They ruled and there was not one white face anywhere. But they teach us that we lived in caves and swung from trees. Black men were never like that.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
I don't know how.
She ate.
If you want to tell me.
How do you like it?
What have you set your mind to?
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
Shhh!
I'm tired of praying.
Let's cancel.
That's right.
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Well, I have this to say. Do you know what a Negro with a B.A., an M.A. and a Ph.D. is called -- by the white man? I'll tell you. He's called a nigger.
Yes, sir, I did.
If you don't know, man, then I feel sorriest for you.
I do know I love you.
Murder.
Make it 1000. We got a lot of fishing to do.
How long has this been going on?
What mission?
I won't let myself come between you and your father. Go home.
You will, baby -- if the time come.
You the man!
Yeah.
Might be all right.
Head nigger in charge?
Okay, baby. Let's flip for it. Flip this.
Are you sure?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
Good grades. Fine athlete. President of his class.
What do you want?
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
So where do we begin?
[Si.]
[What is his name?]
[We don't know! We never see his face! We have to wait in the other room. He was screaming to the girl that...]
[Who's Tazinari?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[Ordered by who?]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I want you.]
[I want you.]
[What do you mean?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Don't lie to me!]
It's loaded.
Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught.
Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
How long you staying, Crease?
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
Everything happens once if you live long enough.
So you'll be the silent type. People will appreciate that.
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I said the plan was right here.
I won't kill again. Hunt people. I gave that up. Anything else? It's yours.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Ein Klines Bisschen. [A tiny bit.]
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
The United States.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
Pretty impressive. Maybe I need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
So you were unhappy?
Where?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
You need to practice.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Don't worry. You will.
Did you used to?
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
Never.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
Because...  I was already dead.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
This is Mr. Creasy.
Hmm?
He has to go.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Oh, yeah.
I could see she likes you.
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
I been looking all over for you!
It's early.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
What they say?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
I'll wait for your call.
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
Oh, that's a sad story.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, what?
Sure, great if you ain't married.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Put on your blue suit...
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Marty...
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
...and they sit down right next to me...
Well...
You should be ashamed of yourself.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
Lemme tell it, Tommy.
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Didn't recognize you, Red. When you get the clamp all the way down, open it as wide as you can and see if you can close it on the artery.
Reckon so, but we been boozing all day and you work up an appetite.
They've hit us on Cherry Hill. I just got word. We have our slack periods but when the action starts, you'll have more work in twelve hours than a civilian surgeon does in a week.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Look at that right eye.
I have great interest for America, his peoples and his custom.
No, Ho-Jon, we're not going to open you up.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
Same general idea.
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
Way we hear it, the Pride is supposed to have run up the highest lifetime batting average ever recorded in Wayne County.
A native is someone who is born in a particular place.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
The nigra boy with the Philadelphia Eagles?
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
No. The only thing to do is write General Hammond.  But it's hard to find a place around here for a private discussion.
We think the same way.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
You betcher ass, Dad.
Right.
I think I heard about that.
I'm sure we could find a date for your team. Why don't I take it up with Henry?  Thanks for the drink, boys.
I don't know why. As long as it's light enough to see your caddie.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
Major Burns is far from satisfied.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
You have a certain modest charm yourself.
Ayuh.
Of course not.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
You're on his side all of the sudden?
In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all.  Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Why would he do that?
I didn't have much choice.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
What's wrong with him?
Let's get his clothes off quick.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
And another one, but it's from the south.  There.
The address of the N.E.P.H. and W. Why don't you meet me there when you're through golf for drinks and dinner and whatever strikes the fancy?
Yeah, I'm all right.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Yeah, that's the one.
Money.
A hundred dollars!
Yes. The John Doe Party.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
You bet I will, Ma.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
We'll get a handwriting expert to—  What!
A deal?
Who, for instance?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Oh!
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
He's watching the other door.
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  Yes sir, they got you!
The heelots!
Sure. Mostly often.
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Yeah, sure. Er, you know Grubbel, for instance.
A what?
Sure, you are.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Yeah, you bet!
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd—
No.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It's Lieutenant Sam Baffert from the San Francisco Police Department.
They want Walter dead!
How can I help you with the particles?
Is that where you're family lives?
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Am I gettin' the car?
You're gettin' the car.
That's right.
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
National Marksman Competition.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Do you really?
Where did you hear that?
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
No.
I need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so I can cut off his nuts.
Thou shall have no other God before me.
Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.  Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
So what do you want to do?
Only that floor.
Let me show you something, Ray.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
She's the one to blame. Not me.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
I've proved that, didn't I?
I've been craving that stuff all week.
Mmm, needs a little something.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Define concern.
Your concern is heartwarming.
What do you think would be in order?
And even if this doesn't work, I want all the money. These SWAT guys don't have the temperament. They don't have the background...
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
I can't do that.
-- Two million people lost in the digital night.  What do they seek?
True.
Why --
If you could meet God, what would you say to him?
-- No.
I'm serious, how did you know my name?
About what?
Guests?
Just like you always wanted.
Not real?
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
Dream?!
But what if he doesn't --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
-- He says the maze has been changed. I need to know for sure.
But have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
Why?
Try harder.
Insurance.
-- The inside?
But you were with me.
Not you.  A copy.
Sorry?!
Male.
IMPACT IN EIGHT SECONDS!
What?!
I've never been this sore in my life.
What does that mean?!
The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED!  You must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and Ivan is released!
Ryan's Comet!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
... A falcon?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
GO IVAN!!
Awwh, Charlie.
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
I guess I am. Just a little.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
Who hired the bastard?
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
That's it.
Something came up.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
Italians, Jews, Irish. One big party. Course, some guys don't get along.
Come off it, Bugs.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
Not stupid. Fat.
I got partners.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Boss, we got our own tradition. We call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
Masseria's been after me too.
We were overdue to get hit.
That's just what I'm sick of. Everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! Greedy for what you got. A bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
Spare us.
Open a window. Every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
Best we got.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Guess so. Ya got a minute? I got somethin' for ya.
This is nice. I mean it.
Olive or eyeball?
Stu Miley.
Sad commentary, huh?
Well - you'd need a body.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can certainly give it...three months.
I think it's a pig hair. <i></i> How much is McDonald's offering?
Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity now, do I really want to get married? But on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
That's not going to stop his nightmare -
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Hyp, I'll do anything.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
I'd better go report this...
The ring...
This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> I gave the order.
Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
That poor boy's a crack dealer from Alphabet City.  We do not allow his kind on this block.
You want to come inside?
But I was dusting.
You know, you never tell me anything.
No, no, it's my fault.  I've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
Aaron?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
Mother!
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Poor man had to leave town.  And I hear that other women came forward.
... Oh ...
Forty-five all total.
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
I'll take your hat into the cloak room.
It was?
Yes! This was how I could be put out of the Senate and out of the way! They even *promised* me that if I--
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
It couldn't be.
Blow a bugle!
Huh?
You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What! Who?
What show? Would you mind telling me what's coming off here?
You play--left field.
Oh--yeah--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. *She* has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
Yeah. Some of my best friends are funny.
Shut up, Diz.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
I apologize.
Any time.
No--not offhand--
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
You don't think he'd want *me* within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his *face*--?
Now, pet--  Jim!
Your name's spreading like wild-fire out here--you are the winterbook favorite to get on the National ticket.
Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.
Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna from heaven--the man *we want*--and the votes *we need*--
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
What stuff?
Yes. Come in.
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
Look! There it is!
I addressed the Chair first, sir!
For one week!
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
Yes, Ma found him slumped over his desk that morning...
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Yes, I was--
But--there are a hundred other places in the state that *need* the water. Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, who owns some of that land--and he didn't say anything about a dam. No-- I'm sure, sir--there's something wrong--and I--I won't vote on this thing until I get a lot of questions answered--
Will he *yield*?
Does my colleague's piece concern Section Forty of the bill--a dam on Willet Creek?
Certainly would, Joseph.
You mean--you tell these men--and Senator Paine what to do?
Oh, no--no!  My dear *Senator*--it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Oh, but this one is so simple.
Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
Tonight.  Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called *dinner*--!
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I did--and--and I got right up.
He did?
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
No!
No! Stop it!
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* name--
In Terry Canyon?
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
Are you drunk?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
But--I've done everything I--
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was *you*. Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising *rightness*--to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a *lot* of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter *what* the odds--he can't *ever* quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the *truth* on his side--
Well, we *must* see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
Ring the call to quorum.
Well--I can *manage*--
I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.
Let's get away from here. 
My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
Okay. See you here.
What do you mean?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Yes--
I thought I could, too.  *My* business--this fine future! I have no future I *care* about, if this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. The only important thing in my life now is to save what I can for him. I want him to get a start again--I'll see that he's taken care of as long as he lives--!  Saunders--whether you ever mean anything to him or not--
It's too late now--it's *impossible*!
I know, but is it worth the risk of a scandal now that a new man is going to the Senate?
Well, then appoint Miller--if you're sure he'll take orders.
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Just a minute, Joe!
*I* know what I'm doing! I'll say what I *want*!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Senator Paine.
Certainly.
Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. You won't have no trouble at all. Talk to anybody.
He sure is pixilated.
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
He sure is.
Next, please.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to—
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
What did he play?
He did?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'd like to read it some time.
Let's just walk, okay?
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Yes, of course.
Oh, hello darling.
Don't be ridiculous.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Have lunch.
When're you going to see him again?
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
Sure.
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
That's the rub.
Right.
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Yes, sir.
I wish you luck, sir.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
All set.
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
Yes.
Are your parents living?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Nah.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
No, thanks.
What're you talking about?
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich.  Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Me?!
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Now you keep out of this!
Thank you so much. Good night.
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Really? You think so?
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99.
Doubtful. What did he say?
We're not sure. She's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. Some of 'em are callin' it --  -- Epstein-Barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... Chronic Fatigue Symptom...
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
Ernest, what do you think?
How do you mean?
As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife.
Why not?
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
Why? I'm paying for this.
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Nope.
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  So what do you think?
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that?
What?
That's a lot of people all at once.
Oh, I don't know...
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard.  Then I did my laundry... watched 20/20.
Okay.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
Sure.
That would explain it.
Can you help Mom?
Got to.
Mother... go away!
Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
No, you can not. I wouldn't know who to say is calling.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
No.
Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
What would you do?
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Is she against you getting help?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
We're only talking about six weeks.
That's not quite what I said --
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
This is exactly what I wanted.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret.
Jerking off?
Definitely.
Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Holy shit!
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
I wish I could live in the shower. I'd take five a day if I had the time. I went to this spa in Germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. And the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
It's not going to be me. I'm giving it up.
When?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
And then killing your sister.
None of the above, thank you.
Why do you like to fight so much?
He has come to help Mister Burns. Somehow I feel responsible.
It is because it was you who read from the Book. He has chosen you to be the human sacrifice needed to regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.
You will not believe it.
Correct, And that's when --
What did you do to him!?
Forty.
No?
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
You don't believe in curses, huh?
No you're not.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
FINE.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
Yes?
All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 B.C.
I was mistaken.
You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah?!
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
What's it look like!?
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
Of course.
Except for one little thing.
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
What --?
I'm his daughter.
Really?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
He was cute though.
But they all had one thing we haven't got.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Thanks.
Think positive.
And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.
Against.
So are you!
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Why not?
Not tonight. 
Date?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
It's home.
Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and I'm it. Maybe -- just maybe -- I can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
Now you're talking.
Yeah.
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
So you're chicken?
Wait!... Look!
Well they've crawled back out.
He hasn't stolen it yet.
Come on.
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
What are you doing in the silver drawer?
You did?
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
Proceed.
Ah -- you approve?
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
I shall tell you in the strictest confidence -- when I was a boy, I had a passion for rafts, and never had the opportunity to build one.
I did, sir.
Please...
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
What do you have in mind?
But where are my wife and son? What's become of them?  Where is Marmont?  Where is Mortier?
That is incredible.
I have never heard an unkind word about her spoken.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
No, they're living in Nice now.
Ah-hh, no.
I see...
My God -- don't you recognize Mouton -- our regimental dog?  I would rather eat Cossack.
Oh?
Earlier this afternoon, the Emperor refused the hand of the Grand Duchess Anna, of Russia, and, as I'm sure you can appreciate, he is quite able to change his mind again.  For the Emperor, to choose a wife, is only a matter of minutes.
I fear our meeting is long overdue... Napoleon.
You have made such excellent use of it; I should think you will hate to leave it.
I'm afraid I am, just a bit.
I'll have the fire built up.
Oh, yes... of course.
When is she supposed to return?
Ah, that is good.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
But you have had mistresses while you were away.
No.
Five minutes.
Five minutes.
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Are you trying to provoke me, monsieur?
If I have given you any cause to be insulted, monsieur, may I offer you immediate satisfaction?
Yes, I do -- very much.
Of course, my dear -- how cruel to have been separated from her.  And how strange it must be for you to be here, away from your family and everything you know.
We have a treaty with Austria.
I am looking for Monsieur George Varlac who resides in the Rue de Frelicot.  Do you know him, monsieur?
No, Monsieur Varlac, my warrant is only for you.  Now, will you please come down at once.  You will be taken back to Chalon for trial.
And I can go free?
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Naw, it ain't like that.
'Cause your lips is getting black.
You know what he mean, dude.
That's fuckin' poetic, Craig.
Naw, I already ate.
What about the dog?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Yeah, I'm alright.  Is my face still orange to you?
I can't taste nothing.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
That's the sister.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
Why?
Okay, plan B.
I know we cousins and all, but don't try an' hook me up with the big little sisters.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
It is easy. You know why?  'Cause they're not expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me and Day-Day to take a good look.
Wait for what?
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
Why didn't she put'em out?
I said hold on!
Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
I'll remember.
I said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
Sorry, dude.
Maybe you can ask him to loan you the money.
I know.
Let it go!
Where's Craig?
I know.  I'm sorry.
Nothing.
Alright, no problem.  We gone.
Shut up!  Where's that other miyatea?
Yeah.
What urgent message?
I don't know the number.
I don't know.
I don't know.
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
What you doing to my nephew?
Craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
It's an important speech.
What the hell are you saying?
For what?
I'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
The gun...
You...
Do you now, Mr. Watson?
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
No, please...
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute.
But...
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
Right.
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
To be a hero?
Don't denigrate yourself, my friend. Where would the government be without accountants?  They wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
Keep it.
Keep it.
Something is going to happen. When it's over you'll know what I was talking about.
Cover your mouth.
It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
What are you going to do?
Hi.
Thanks for the tip.
I don't think so.
Why?
Help me get her off the rug.
You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control.
Nah.  Hates his wife.
Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they?
Come with me, honey.
Go ahead, sugar Die.
What'd I say?  What? What? What? What?
Hm!
The religion the Almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
If you was to let that money serve the Lord's purposes, He might feel kindly turned towards you.
Pshaw now! Ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
When'll the skiff be ready?
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
There hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook Mister Gar. What a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
It's more fun hearin' stories in the dark.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How do you mean?
Mother, I only --
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Tricked us!
It's awful soon after Ben's passing.
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
She'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- Harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  She was drinking.
Blue men.
'Cause you're too little.
Pearl! Oh, Pearl!
It'll spoil our supper.
Dead. 
I mind you said there was two.
What?
Tst-tst! Then I reckon I'll have to try again! Where's the money hid?
All right.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
No.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Only she won't never let me play with it.
Yes; from the first night.
Our honeymoon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
It's about that John and that Pearl?
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Them kids!
Miz Cooper. I never went to sewin' lessons all them times.
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
I sure as hell hope so.
Thank God.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
Oh -- jeez -- Glen! Rod's gone ape!
You believe in anything?
No.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Yeah, and if he gets me, I'm pretty sure you're next.
How you plan to do that?
What!?
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
School.
Get into bed.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
So he's alive?
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
I told you.  It was dark, but I'm sure there was someone else IN there, under the covers with her.
I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; I dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room I was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. Sort of... obscenely. Then he walked out through the wall on the other side. Like he'd just come to check me out...
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Good. No more nightmares for either of us then.
Bring me forty-five back.
From Leon!... How is he?... Come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
An omelet.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
About what?
You should. I'll show you.
I see.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
An evening gown.
Evening gown?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
You want this?
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
Or it might be the firing squad!
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Why should you be afraid?
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
May I add, sir, that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx's Capital on your night table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust, sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady.
It is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Comrade.
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Look for yourselves.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
No, thank you.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Private.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
I must get into that country of yours!
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Suppress it.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Yes, very strange.
I will do my best.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
It's false sentimentality.
Oh, let it ring.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
My darling.
What, darling?
Darling, darling... please!
Shhh! Shhh!
All right.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
Has done what?
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Madame, if you...
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
You leave me no choice.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I will do my best.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Sir, I still don't think, uh, we can contain it anymore.  There's a cancer on the presidency.  And it's growing. With every day that ...
I agree it's ridiculous but --
We have nothing to hide.  But the only flaw in the plan is that they're not going to believe the truth.  That is the incredible thing!
John, you don't want to start down that road.  I remember what Whittaker Chambers told me back in '48 -- and he was a man who suffered greatly -- he said, "On the road of the informer, it's always night."  This is beyond you or even me.  It's the country, John.  It's the presidency.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
You do it.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
And?
What the hell are you doing, Ehrlichman?  Screwing with the CIA?  I don't care how much he wants -- pay him.
We should set up a Cuban defense fund on this; take care of all of them.
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
My point exactly!  Somebody had to die before his shit got in the paper! Fucking Kennedys get away with everything.  Do you see me screwing everything that moves?  For Christ's sake!  I did what the New York Times editorial page said we should do!  I ended the war, I got SALT I with the Russians, I opened China!  So why are these cocksuckers turning on me?  Because they don't like the way I look.  Where I went to school.
We are covering up!  For some petty, stupid shit.  There are things I can say -- when other people say them, they'd be lies. But when I say them nobody believes me anyway ...
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
You know, Al, men in your profession ... you give 'em a pistol and you leave the room.
That's what they're doing.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Can we get around this, Al?
How do you see this?
That's right ...
I know it well, sir.
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Because he didn't even know about it. The CIA never told him, they just kept it going.  It was like ... it had a life of its own.  Like ... a kind of "beast" that doesn't even know it exists.  It just eats people when it doesn't need 'em anymore.  Two days after the Bay of Pigs, Kennedy called me in.  He reamed my ass ...
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
... but even the presidency isn't enough anymore ...
We ought to fire his whining ass. Right now when he's on top.  You know what -- it'll set the right example for the rest of this administration.
... beating out the other papers, chasing girls ...
He'll be looking in his toilet bowl every time he pulls the chain.
It's Helms -- it's got to be.
For God's sake, when does this end?!
Sir ... six bodies.
Why me?
No, no!  Please, don't.  Don't tell him.  I'll never do it again.  I promise.  I promise ...  Please, mama ...
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Firing you, Mr. Helms, wouldn't do any good.  Of course you'll continue as DCI.  You're doing a magnificent job.
We have recent intelligence that a Soviet nuclear submarine has docked at Cienfuegos.
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
You asked if you could count on my support ... As long as I can count on yours.
We can't keep a goddamn secret in this government, Edgar.  They're stealing papers right out of his office.
Jesus, I'd like to book him into a psychiatrist's office.  He comes in here ranting and raving, dumping his crap all over the place ... Could you prove it, Edgar?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Party ain't started yet, Dick.  Got these gals coming over to the ranch later for a little private "thing," y'know ... There's some fellows I want you to meet.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
That's what geopolitics is about -- the whole world linked by self interest ... You tell me, Ron, how the hell I can explain that on television to a bunch of simple-minded reporters and weeping fucking mothers!
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Secret, Mr. Chairman?
I don't know.  He made me see the stars ...
I came down here to close a deal for Studebaker.
They were throwing rocks, John, just rocks.  They don't think I feel ... but I feel too much sometimes.  I just can't let a whole policy get dominated by our sentimentality.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
But change always comes slowly.  I've withdrawn more than half the troops. I'm trying to cut the military budget for the first time in thirty years.  I want an all-volunteer army.  But it's also a question of American credibility, our position in the world ...
Hello ...
She must be very attractive.  Would she like an autograph?  She might remember me ... Where's Trini?
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Well, we could delete it.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
No, I'm not!  I'm finished.
They've lost a brother.  You know what that means, Dick.
They love you, Buddy.  They need you, too.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
I asked him, "Lyndon, what would you do, on a scale of one to ten?"  And he said, "Bomb the shit out of Hanoi, boy!  Bomb them where they live." ... John, do you think I was too soft on TV?
Then what are you scared of, honey?
They were for me.  They're mine.
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
I am older.
How fresh is this coffee?
In Angola. Yeah.
Nineteen zero and nine.
Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'.  Diggin' in that hard caliche.
No ID in her room?
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Who's he in trouble with then?
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
No.
You sure?
I'm hidin' behind you.
Wasn't no bullet.
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when.
Okay.
You gave your word?
I need to know that.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Uh-huh.
You are comin back, ain't ya?
What did you tell him?
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
I do know to a certainty. And you know what's going to happen now. You should admit your situation. There would be more dignity in it.
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.
Well -- where ya goin'?
I seen you was from Dallas.
With anything?
Now. We close now.
Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed.
You live in that house behind the store?
For what?
Somethin' like that.
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
No sir, it's unusual.
I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
When did you last see him.
Yes?
I know how he found me.
No. You don't understand.
What did you do?
Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
What product.
No. You don't.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
No sir.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
What outfit.
You should get the order you want.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Bad idea...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Junior year!
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
Great. Good. Content...
You must be joking.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Good. I'm prepared to offer you a job. You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally clear?  Fine...
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
Maroon.  I stole it.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
You're in serious danger!
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Did you love it?
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I married a car salesman.
...did I win some contest?
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
I was talking about what you could wear!
What? Where was he?!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
You never know who you'll see.
You still in love?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
I don't follow...
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh?  Is that stupid, Wesley?
Wesley...  Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
A mark, huh?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
I said 'got it?'
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
Huh? Oh, umm, a car.  So, to a successful transaction...
It is, if you like idiots...
He's waiting...
"Injuns?"
We know that...
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Oh, there's no tellin' what that girl could've accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a childhood... caring for her father, going to school.
Yeah. Why, you know him?
David Ravell.
She's a lesbian.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Awful sorry I betrayed you fellas; must be my Hogwallop blood.
Good Lord, what do we do?
Izzat right?
That ain't it!
Problem a p'seption.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
Helluva awgazation.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Ain't gonna paddle it; he's gonna kick it real hard.
Well, I believe it's mawva kickin' sichation.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
Powas p'suasion.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
- in the gods - Huh?
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
Pete, it's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart. What the hell's that singing?
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
We ain't got a constichency! Stokes got a constichency!
I been calling for four months.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
No, sir!
I said, come here!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yeah.
Or we could do that yeah.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
But in what ways?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
I don't know where that is.
I can't risk it.
I've seen better.
Sure.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
Peace out.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
Not that one.
Fourteen business days.  Escrow is always business days.
You're an idiot.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Can't.  Whole point.  Can't get in the room.
They're coughing.
And we're never getting in.
I don't get it.
Evan, I am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
He's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
No, you will not, because without Burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as I'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
What is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  You're a bus driver, "Homes," you live in Flatbush, so please don't start spouting some Elmore Leonard shit you just heard because I saw that movie too,
Observe.
PANIC ROOM!
Chills?
Blue is phones?
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
I'm sorry.
I was trying not to tell you...
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
Yeah.
What? So you can shoot me? Call it resisting arrest?
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Man... fuck you. Why you always bustin' my balls? All that high and mighty militant shit. I ain't doing nothing.
Man, fuck you!!!
Party needs the bread.  Be hip to the struggle, only a dollar!!!
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.
You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
No sir he didn't.
Work harder. And get me some results. Those Black Bastards could be up to anything.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Where you been? I saw the cops rousting you at the rally.
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
Yeah.
Yeah... I guess. Any of other Panthers know about this?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
And who is we?
Yeah, well, cops kick the shit out of kids too.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
If you got something to say, say it.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Shut the fuck up!!
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Didn't want folks to think I was a snitch. You know?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yeah... cop hit me...
Congratulations.
I... uh... that wasn't me, it was Samuel... I mean Nathan...
That would be nice.
His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically.  But he has a weakness.
I've done nothing and for that I am ashamed.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Oh?
Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status.
Restrain them from the targeting of civilians, including women and children?
Are you going to meet with him?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were born.  I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her.
I don't care.  I hate him.
That's a damn long time...
And your principles?
Not held, just slowed down.
No, there'll be skirmishers on the roads.  We're safer here.
Leave him.  Take care of William and Susan.
Proud, priggish and competent.  A very bad combination in an adversary.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I hate that smell.
Huh?
I swear.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want.
Good for you.
Ayuh--they get older as you go toward the middle.  Pete LaVasseur's dog is buried there...  the Stoppard boys' racing pigeon that Missus Cowley's cat got...and I think that's the cat himself right there, although it's been so many years I can't tell for sure.  Missy Ellen! Come over here just a minute!
For Ellie's birthday, yes. I didn't go because her old man thinks I'm a shit and the feeling is heartily re- ciprocated...they'll be back tomorrow night. Jud, what's this about?
Yes.
I don't know.
Is there quicksand?
You keep saying that.
Whose burying ground?
Don't worry about that.
Jud, why am I doing all this?
Why, saved a little girl from being unhappy...that's all. Drink up, Louis!
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Why, then, things should be fine.
Jesus, the road!
I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow.
Did you see his shirt?
According to what Mr. Crandall says, the road's a lot more dangerous than the operation. Church will be just the same. Well--almost the same--and we won't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks.
You can't.  I can.
Simple.  I have something you won't more than anything.  The way to free you from the curse of the treasure.  You have something I want -- more than anything.
You give me the Pearl.  Then I tell you who you need.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
That's fair.
What're you suggesting?
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Did you, now?
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Boy overboard!
Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine!  Go capture him.
Commodore, please!
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Not as a condition -- a request.
That would hardly be proper.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
Me!
I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child.  Let's hear it.
Exactly.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
First -- have you found me a crew?
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Not if the fool has something Barbossa wants.  Something he needs.
We're not going to just surrender!
I don't think that will be necessary.
Indeed.
We are bound for Port Royal, not Isla de Muerta.
They left me stranded.  Twice. What have you got to lose?
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Commandeer.  We're going to commandeer a ship.  Nautical term.
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
On what?
No, it's not.
Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and sodium pentothal.  He'll sleep, that's all.
Wow, that is one moving story.  Take it easy on my heart strings.  Now I really feel guilty complaining about you shooting me up with your poison.
Yeah, I'm going to finish what you started --
It's ready now, I know it is.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
If you loved me like I loved you?
The nanobot is gone.
Shut up and do it!
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Mr. Sim, watch out!  O'Brien escaped and could be on his way!
And for cleaning up oil spills.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Mouse?  What mouse?
Yes.
Got it.
The waste.
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
That's going to fit me?
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
Yes.
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you?  How about 'infantile dementia'?
And you have him?
While you remain on the staff at Argon Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon's priorities.  I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl like you to figure out.
You won't.  That's why you're whispering.
Certainly. Right over there.
For the letters, of course.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it?  Well, well! Ain't that nice!
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Gallagher?
What are you talking about?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play!  Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
Oh, hello Mother!
I was so worried for fear he'd knock over a vase or something. I must have acted like an idiot.  What does it say about the reception last night?
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Mother!
Oh, that's all right with me. I won't hold it against you. But you see, I'm here to find out about—
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
My play.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around.  Gilded cage?!  Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha!  That mug. What does he know?
Hello, Hank. How are you?
Been where?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Here you are.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
I have it here.
Good.
Well, at best you might deny it.
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
It's all right. Bring him in.
Now the lady said you may go—
No, sir.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
That's all I wanted to know!
No she's not.
It's alright.
It's fine. You'll put on some make up and ...
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
To be honest Mary Sue. I didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
Trust me ...
We were gonna ... You know ...
Now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? Don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
That's not going to happen!
But it could happen.
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
Thank you very much.
Good. Do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
Very well. Let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
Oh sure it is.
How'd you know how to put it out and all?
Hunh.
I don't think so.
It's in your closet.
He won't notice anyway.
Nothing.
They're happy like this.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
Really? It seems so fattening.
Not directly anyhow ...
... Yeah.
Yes.
This thing works. We could go home right now.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Well--it all just keeps going. Roads ... rivers ...
What?
Out there.
Rain.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
My name's David.
Excuse me?
Well they're not just cookies. I mean, they're great cookies ... Look, I'd love to get into this whole thing but I'm really running late. Why don't we hook up tomorrow?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
I am actually ... Glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
Yeah ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
Yeah.
Aren't you a little early?
Well here I am.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Hello everyone.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Are you gonna do it?
I....please don't do this.
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
Sure.
...just talking to you....
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Hi....what....what's up....?
Can I ask you a question?
You don't even know how much it is.
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
I need help.
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
I think that'll be fine.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
I saw a picture of you.
....Hi.....
....Hi.....
About six months.
You were talking about the promotion --
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Really?
So what do I do then?
Yeah?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?
yeah.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
I think maybe over a hundred.
That's right you travel so much.
You can't do that.
Bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
I don't know.
I cut myself.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
And your Social Security number.
It's ok, take your time.
No one will know your name.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
How's business?
It's alright.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Fine, thank you.
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
I'm sorry.
Why you wearin' a suit?
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
So what should I do with the pudding?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What happened?
Ok.
Ok.
Yeah.
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Please don't do this.
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
Are you going to the party tonight?
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
It's fine.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Once or twice.
Now give the signal.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
Mustn't do that, sir.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
Good day, Marquis.
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
A man after my own heart...
Your words drove Bouchon to --
I know, because I felt it myself --
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
It's a formality; truly.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
What of my lips, will you soil them too? When you've broken every other taboo?
Come now, darling, give it a read.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Is it terribly erotic?
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
No. But tell him I would.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
....shame on you, truly...
But it's just begun --
No, when I was but a tender lad--
You're just scared.
Am I?
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Mm.
And he did.
The actor
I'll remember that.
There's no call for that language-
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
It's 12th Century. From Deauville -- in France.
You are repellant when you drink.
How so?
Please be quiet.
I can't remember the lines!
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
Nonsense
Forget it-
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
Butts on seats. That's what movies are about. You got one job in Hollywood -- everyone has the same job, in fact -- putting the butts on the seats. You gotta sell 'em popcorn and Pepsi- cola. It's all about popcorn and Pepsi-cola.
Kid, you just got your ass kicked on Joseph Conrad and now you're gonna go to Schaefer and tell him you wanna do the id and the superego? Stop being so goddamn smart.
The old man has his own way of doing things
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
Oh Christ...
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
He was a drunk. And he was my father and I was ashamed of him.
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
I told you this was going to happen! I told you he was going to come after us! So we took the chance anyway and we lost. That's how it goes, okay? I got my check, kid, and so did you -- and that's what it's all about -- so fuck it and move on.
George...
I been talking to Swanbeck in New York and... Orson, I think they're gonna take it A long pause as Welles looks at Schaefer
So ain't this just the bee's knees? The high muckey-mucks dolled up all Aztec-like for the human sacrifice.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
Get out
Get out.
Again.
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
They've all seen a rough cut
You don't think I've tried? No one is willing to open the picture
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
It's not done.
It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
How do you know? You know her that good?
You want the title shot or not?
Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
It didn't have nothin' to do with you.
Some things changed between us. Now, he thinks who the fuck he is. He's been passing certain remarks that I don't like.
So what?
You're very smart, Joey, very smart. Nobody gives me a straight answer around here. You're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. Did you fuck Vickie?
Nine o'clock.
At night?
Are you outa your mind? If I come out, I'll lose the title.
Oh no? I thought you was a movie star.
Just keep your eye on the ball.
No.
What does that mean?
Jake...
Who asked you?
Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
"Father of the Bride."
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
No. Open the door.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Does he have your number, Mr. Jefferies?
Goodnight.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
You think I made all this up?
You told me.  I've got to run, Jeff.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Who left -- where?
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
A possibility.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Something wrong?
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
Tell her to bring it back!
You've got a hormone deficiency.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Now wait a minute --
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Only because it's expected of her.
I think it's enchanting.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Three.
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
So do I.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
Homework. It's more interesting.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
All right -- but what's he doing now?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window. 
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
What?
Chicken?
Stay there.
Down in back.
Hang loose.  We got all night.
You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Plato.
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
Plato.  It's a nickname.
They're still there!
I hitched.
Judy.
Come out come out wherever you are!
No.  I'm scared.
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
Who?
Plato!
My gun?
I need it.
I shot at one of them.
Hang loose, boy.  I'm warning you.
No.
I just get so--  Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY  Okay.  Okay.  Let it out.
Try the desk.
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
Okay--
Who lives?
You going there?
Dig the square wardrobe!
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
He hates me.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
What?
Must have a way with stationery.
Read a lot about you, Nick.
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Smile.
Not bad. Just regular.  You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
JESUS CHRIST!
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
No, Nick, no --
I love you!
For what? You to talk me into "helping"? What, he promise you a share of the winnings?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
All I wanted... was to make it home... for a little of Dad's turkey, and Mom's stuffing... Aunt Lisbeth's acorn gravy... Aunt Mary's cranberry buns...
I don't know...
We need to find a way to make me part of it.
No.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
Well. I'm going home.
What are you talking about?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
What'd they call her in college?
Christmas... Eve...
What the fuck are you talking about.
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
Put it on.
Six men means six guns.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
How'd you know my name...
Show's over.
We're aware of your position.
We're all outta gifts, boys and girls, but we got charitable donations!
Hell yeah. You work here long?
How long ago was your makeover?
How do we take them out?
DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
It's a roach, guy --
Fuckin, Zookerman --
Three days, man.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
Shoulda written, Rudy...
Thought you hated Sidnaw.
And you set me up.
You're hitting for MY cards!
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
I'm ninety-two years old --
I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
That I should've picked you up?
Scagnetti? Oh shit, I hear he's a motherfucker.
You don't hafta lift shit. You don't really work there. But as far as the records are concerned, you do. I call up Matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. You're on the schedule. You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti thinkin "what the fuck." And if Scagnetti ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin. We gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. You're at the Taft airstrip pickin' up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. Part of your job is goin' different places - and we got places all over the place.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Elois?
How do you know all this?
Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
That's okay, Eddie, I do.
Pam Grier.
Well, if this crook's a Brewers fan, his ass has gotta be from Wisconsin. And I'll bet you everything from a diddle-eyed Joe to a damned-if-I- know, that in Milwaukee they got a sheet on this Mr. White motherfucker's ass. I want you to go through the mugs of guys from old Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery, and put a name to that face.
What?
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
Well, what I wanna do is go back to work. But I got this Scagnetti prick deep up my ass. He won't let me leave the halfway house till I get some piece of shit job. My plans have always been to be part of the team again.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
No, they're not.
That piece of shit. Workin' with the cops.
What's my problem? Yeah, I gotta problem. I gotta big problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
He's the reason the place turned into a shooting gallery.  What are you, a silent partner? Fuckin' tell him.
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
Can you believe the songs they been playin'?
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
What's wrong with it?
A few cops.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
Did ya see what happened to anybody else?
Joe could help him. If we can get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor, Joe could get a doctor to come and see him.
He asked.
I'll make you a bet that those same damn niggers who were showin' their ass in public, when their bitches get 'em home, they chill the fuck out.
Maybe he did.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
I'm Clay Phillips.  My brother Steve.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
That's fine.
Why do you think?
Maybe it's better that way.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Which ranch?
A little hot.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Of course I do -- but it'd be better for you -- and the house is kind of small --
It isn't that --
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Well, say it.
Yes, people make me restless.
And you're all alone.
Yeah.
Who brought you here?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Don't you even know your letters?
I sure would.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Steve --
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Thanks.
Hello Ray.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
You sure?
Maybe we can study together or something.
Open chest!!!
Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Yes...
Great!!!
No. Keep rubbing.
So, whatever happened to her?
She killed herself a week before he died.
It's the sequel.
Oh, right.
I'm Hanson the caretaker.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
Made you say it!
Both of them?
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Oh.
Let's start with some rhythm. Sway back and forth like this.
Yeah, bitch, give me my apple. What's gotten into you?
I wouldn't go that far.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
Who?
Let me see the files.
What's this?
It's not what is looks like. She's having a breakdown. Help me get her to her room.
That's why we came here, remember?
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
I'm not even wearing any drawers. Forget about a belt.
Alright, go to the belt store...
It's okay. I understand.
Not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
No, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
What does it say?
Aww. Cool. Dude.
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
That's right up the street! Come on! Just in case!
"Serial Mom"?  WOW!
Sure do. Did you bring back "Ghost Dad"?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Oh Mom...
CHIP! You know how much I hate the brown word!
You scared me.
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Suspect's family is headed east on Calverton....
And all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
I just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
We can be real quiet...
Ooohhhh!
Oh, honey!
Sorry, ma'am.  We're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain Mrs. Dottie Hinkle.
...People who don't mind their own business.
Let me check the zip - 212 Fuck you?
Yes, I was.
You know how I hate gum, Misty. All that chomping and cheesing... 
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Certainly not!
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
What's he know?
We have mice! I mean it, Ralph! I saw one!
I'll give you fifty cents.
That's what she told you. I looked it up at the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright girt.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I'd like to get out of here.
Then, you also understand that you must die.
But why? She's been ill --erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!
But I'd give a great deal to know.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but it doesn't make good sense.
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
I don't know.
You know about the Palladists -- you know who they are -- what they are. I was one of them.
Good-bye.
Yes.
I don't think that's so revealing.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
It's here, too.
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
Well, since, you're over twenty one——
Why not let your publisher judge that?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
She is very young -- I have an old habit of failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
I don't know.
It would be a charming experience. She might only protest half as much.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
I'm very, very serious.
Thank you, my dear.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Why?
I had to help get rid of the body. You saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary -- go back -- you don't know what you're doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget Jacqueline.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
Because I have something very important to do.
Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Oh, uh-huh.
No, I think you look... fine.
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
Nine years.
Do you want them?
Agreed.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Ann. Hello.
Can we look at one?
Why not?
Because I promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.
I don't... why... why do you do this?
You know?
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
That's a good question.
What will you do when the money runs out?
It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Yes.
About me?
Yes.
What was the problem?
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
Did you confront John with the fact that you knew about him?
Subtlety?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Who'd you have lunch with?
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Radon leakage?
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
Is he still at your house?
Yes.
Do you want to leave therapy?
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
Well, why?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
No!
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
You touched him?
You are in trouble.
Why?
What is it?
It does not.
It was busy.
You want me to leave?
No, I really can't. I find it healthy never to characterize people I don't know or conversations I haven't heard. I don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. Last time I saw Ann she left here very... confused, I would say. And upset.
She didn't tell you why she was upset?
Nothing.
And that's all?
No.
Yes.
Prettier than Ann?
Okay.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Cynthia. John. Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.
Cynthia. John.
That you... you don't even know the guy.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
I just... Ann is very...
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
Plus first and last month deposit.
What the hell do you think? I love Ann. You think I'm going to tell her about Cynthia and hurt her feelings like that?
I need help? Whose sitting by himself in a room choking his chauncey to a bunch of videotapes, Graham? Not me, buddy. You're the fucking nut. Now show me those tapes.
Goddamit...
One moment.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Oh, no. I haven't seen Dr. Hobbes since I was in medical school. He taught me... he was my prof in urology and... I think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. That was it. I had no idea he'd ever set foot in Starliner Towers until today.
Far as I know, yeah, that was her.
Yeah, that's Dr. St. Luc. He's the head of our little medical clinic here.
Please, Janine. Please, pleasepleaseplease, Janine Janine JanineJanineJanine...
Please pardon me. I am Niccolo Spergazzi. I am a resident here. I don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... Cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
Look. You got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. Now. Why not breed a parasite that does something useful? Eh? Why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? Why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? If it takes a little blood for itself, so what? Be generous! You can afford it.
Huh?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
NIGHT NIGHT
WELL FIRST YOU GO RIP RIP RIP THEN YOU GO SNIP SNIP SNIP THEN YOU WHIP IN A ZIP ZIP ZIP AN' YOU SPLIT IT UP TO THE HIP HIP HIP AN' AS YOU STRIP STRIP STRIP YOU QUIVER AND SHIVER FOR THAT SOFT CARESS AS YOU SLIP SLIP SLIP...INTO THAT LITTLE BLACK DRESS
So it seems.
Indulge?
President?  Past Presidents! Betty, this is beginning to add up.
I'd forgotten.
Who?
It's...
Vance!  Vance Parker.
No...couldn't I do this later?
It's classical.  Almost a textbook case...
Of course.  He was in great danger of harming himself.
I never signed the contract.  He's not going anywhere.
And you can 'peep in' on Brad in the morning.
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
She walks in beauty...
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
And?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
You're a wonderful writer, Miles. Don't be discouraged.
My condolences.
Lot of good stuff.  Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?
Glass or bottle?
You got it.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Nice.
Good. How're you?
Not so bad yourself.
No, I'm an actor.
Yeah, Conundrum.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
That's a good age.
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
I'd rather have a knife.
And Lexapro, yes.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
So what's the plan today?
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Nope.
You're an asshole.
Obsessively.
Slaughterhouse.
What exactly are we going to do?
Are they too sporty?
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
Huh. Let me think.
What's that?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
No way. No way.
Me?
I feel like driving.
You need a new car anyway.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Sure.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Miles?
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
I am.
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Well, you boys do what you want. I just think it would be nice for us to be together as a family on my birthday.
It tastes old.
A hair.
That's weird.
...I will.
That's right.
Eleven a.m. They're gone.
Already thought of. Two other birds did the same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see they hit something.
Ray Reddy's house.
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
Got it!
I have some upstairs.
Oh.
Where are we going to sleep?
Don't yell at her!
You're scaring your sister.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
I would say so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
You take care of yourself...  Graham.
What book!
They'll find a way in.
No money, eh?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
The one with the shotgun.
Where were you?
Goodbye?
That's why I'm here.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
Yup. The whole rig. I don't care much about the rest, but I surely will miss that bay. Least they didn't kill me. That was right considerate, I thought. They were laughing when they left me. Thought it was real funny. I walked for a little while but there was no use, so I gave it up. Figured it was just bad luck.
I expect.
I hate to see any man swing. Bad luck.
No hard feelings.
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.
The other guy drew first.
Howdy.
Give the man a line of credit. He already owes the house thirteen bucks.
We're going to make some adjustments. I wanted you to be here when I offered Paden your job. I think he could do it without getting greedy. Stella and I are tired of you skimming our profits.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
It's none of your business.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
Because they enjoy it.
What about his brother?
You've got a legitimate job.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I run the place. What can I get you?
Me too. What's wrong with us?
You see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
So-called?
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
I'm ready for that.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. You got a lot in common.
Of course.
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
I'm glad we talked.
Excuse us.
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
The picture's dead.
Good to see you too, Elaine.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
If it's on the page...
There isn't one.
Simone does not control my destiny.
I should fire you more often.  The film's looking wonderful.
She doesn't want pity.
I'll try.  Maybe live but remote. She'll never go to them.
I'd love to.  But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards.  I should be going, she'll be here soon --
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Oh, Viktor.  You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this.  But in the morning, you'd go back to her.  What man wouldn't?
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Yes, of course, but very beautiful in your own right.
Do what you do to Simone.
What I do to Simone?
Yes, yes, again, again.  Do what you do to Simone.  I want to know what it's like to be her just for one night.
Body double.
For you.  I want you to know, Simone appreciates you all working for scale.  But why am I thanking you? Simone can thank you herself.  She insisted on speaking with you before filming begins.  She's on the line now.
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
I have to talk to her about my experimental film.  It's very... experimental.
I was misquoted.
I'm sorry.
That's why you're so perfect.  You have something I don't have.
"Straw God" changed my life.
She still with Kent?
There was no other way.
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
You know, I... don't know.
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
If anyone asks about Simone --
-- I know, I don't know anything.
Night, Lainey.
You know me -- married to my work.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
Lainey...
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
Don't you have a real story to write?  Why aren't you in Latin America?
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
No.  Thanks.  Absolutely.
Why?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
Sometimes you have to tell a small lie to get to the bigger truth.  As for a photo -- if you can't do it, I know twelve million people who can.
What do you want -- ?
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
You know what I'm talking about.
--Do I know you?
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
Thanks.
You're a doctor. What kind?
Words.
Yes.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Them?
Yes.
I don't know.
They talk to you?
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
I know.
Like what?
You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
S-ssssstop it!
J. C. Penny's?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Chicken blood on the crops.
...Chicken blood? Who said it was... "chicken blood"?
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Slut.
The band.
The hell with this.  I'm coming back up!!!
Find out what's holding things up. I want to get the hell off this farm.
Missed you at church this morning, Jeremiah.
Sounds familiar.
Book of Jeremiah.
Bus broke down.
Died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. Next.
Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
"-- an AXE!"
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
-- It's not me!
Down boy.
Then why go back now?
You never had trouble communicating before.
-- You're not making sense!! What "Scarecrow"?
It's you. You and your father.
Listen to me --
'Mornin', Jack.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
And that makes you look like a squid?
Whatcha' doin'?
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
He tried to kill you, Starla.
You took Bill.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shelby --
Sorry.
Hell, I was game!
Yep. And while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? Osso buco?...
Wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. I remember it.
No! No. Heh. I'll be right back.
Gold--digger, huh?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
Why? You have a bowling date?
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Okay.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
He's after us again!
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Weight Station.
Maybe six months with good behavior.  One to five.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
Also boring.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool.  Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
I would say your future's looking dim, boss.
My handle's Smokey Bear and I got you by the tail.
If that sumbitch was in the race, he'd be in the winner's circle by now.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Is your security team armed?
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
And when you saw him later, he was wearing one of your security jackets --
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
You were here huntin' a man named Israel, weren't you? Your name is Tremor.
You think so?
-- Fine, fuck, I got it... Lake Tahoe, Nevada. I'll have Hugo book your flight, you can be here in a couple hours. He'll meet you at the airport.
I left him a message.
...to what? Incinerate? 'Cuz I'm almost dead certain there's not a fucking laundry detergent or dry cleaning process known to man that can ever return that jacket to its former glory! Some shit, suffice it to say, just don't wash out.  Now, the money question... To whom does that stain belong?
Without peer?
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
-- Buddy, it's bigger than that, they want 'em all, Ivy, Beanie --
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
You're finished.
...So you made another deal?
Yeah... Sid?
You got clicks, anything?
-- okay, g'head --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
None whatsoever.
Okay -- yeah, I can, I respect that.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
A Fed? Like FBI?
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
No?  Who am I, then?
Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Why did you agree to come here?
You fucking bastard...
He'll let me in.
Who was it?
Oh, that's a relief.
Rheya.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
That's right.  And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Oh, this one you love?  What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  You didn't love her?
I love her.
I'll be right back.
Yes.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Let's go home.
Is it intelligent?
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man.  Even the limits we put on it are human limits.  It can do this, it can do that!  It designs, it creates!
I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth.  This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Not this time.
Gibarian.  He was here.
I love you.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Then you won't make it.
You're lying.
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
Please.  Don't.
It's an experiment.
Fuck me.  I knew it.
Looks a little constipated to me.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Uh...
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
I'm supposed to call in.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
Let's get a drink.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Listen, that was my fault.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
You were reading my Renoir.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Let go!
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Do you?
I don't know...
I do.
Absolutely.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
I might stop you.
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
She took you shopping for a tie?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
I'll be right up.
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear what I said?!!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
I'm sorry.
What did you watch?
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
Why should she come in?
I know where everything is.
Yeah.  She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'Bye, Dad.
Be nice.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
I'm always here, Pete.
Flash, drop it--
-- but they got it all wrong.  Any fool can figure it out.  Spider-Man nailed this guy!
Lemme down, bugface!
Right.
Get inside and get pictures.  Fifty bucks.
Gimme that.  Pick it up later.
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Would you cool it already?
Deal.  But don't tell anyone.  I want to keep a low profile.
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Some things you should say anyway.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
I hate people with alliterative names.
Thank God.
Since you're feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
What?
You should write that one down.
"Flash," Liz.  You're going out with something that calls itself "Flash."
Hurry up, Flash!
Oh. Maybe I should, too--
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
I know what you mean.  I...
Unh-huh.  Excuse me.  I've gotta go.
Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
Oh, God, I forgot to--
I... I like you.  A lot.
Some of him… char-broiled bones. Teeth. We ruled out suicide.  Any bad blood between him and Ock?
There's an infinitely greater danger. If--  Listen.  The only thing Octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  To do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, SL 270.
I know him.
Einstein, right?  We'll see ya.
Nope.  Maybe he skipped to Rio. Feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  Are you absolutely positive that one at E.S.U. is kaput?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
No.
See?  You big dullard.
It's fine.  Tell me what--
Rosomoff, I have better things to do than teach Introductory Physics to mindless adolescents.
No. It isn't.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
Like it?
They never caught on.
Plenty.
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
Any news on Dunbar?
Don't worry. He'll be all right.
Forget it. He'll be back here. They've got no proof.
Just what makes you and them Krauts so buddy-buddy?
Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
Which one of you is what?
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Who doesn't! Suppose we wait until we hit the Waldorf Astoria.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Me? What if she don't want me?
This is a good one!  Shut up, everybody! Listen to this!  'The President of the United States to Harry Shapiro. Greeting: Having submitted yourself to a local board, you are hereby notified to report...' What do you know! So now I'm a draft evader!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
I want everybody out of here. We'll need a lot of commotion on the compound.
What radio?
Lay off, I said -- if you don't want your head handed to you.
Anybody cover?
I'll tell you how come.  The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
Are you questioning me?
What did you say?
Go where? To the Kommandant's office and tell him where Dunbar is?
Good morning, Schulz. And how's Mrs. Schulz? And all the little Schulzes?
You Americans! You are the craziest people! That's why I like you! I wish I could invite you all to my house for a nice German Christmas!
No! No!
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
That is my wife.
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
He is.
Wait. The Bozeman,why did it change course?
Yes, sir. There are two in the Veridian system.
Agreed.
All hands, brace for impact!
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
For you. This is where you wanted to be.
Left behind?
I don't understand.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Yes, yes, it is.
Better?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
Sulu. When did he find the time for a family?
Where are the deflector relays?
Normal is what everyone else is, and what you are not.
We learn something new about ourselves every day.  Now. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. It is very important that you tell me exactly what Captain Picard knows.
Bad food, brutal discipline.  No women.
As ship's counselor, it's your duty to know not only when you're needed but also when you're not.
There's nothing selfish about pursuing your own life, your own career.
The Nexus.
There are no other ships in the system.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Not from here, no.
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Sector three... Sub-tropical vegetation... Temperature --  Temperature decreasing rapidly --
It's a little early to celebrate.
Not exactly.
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
Pon Farr. Vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
No!... I'll do it.  Give me your phaser.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Do you have an explanation?
We are under attack! Stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
Mr. Scott. Have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
Come, come, Scotty. Young minds. Fresh ideas.  Be tolerant.
Just him, sir!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
Saavik. Send to Ambassador Sarek. Tell him we're coming in.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Jim, in your absence, Genesis has become a galactic controversy... Until the Federation Council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of Genesis... Consider it a quarantined planet. And a forbidden subject.
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Then I'll find a ship -- I'll hire a ship.
Who is this?! How dare you --
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
But, why?

Then you must know that you should have come with him to Vulcan.
Yes...
What you ask is difficult.
What I have done, I had to do.
Station!
<U>We are Klingons</U>! Once you control the ship, I will transfer my flag there. And we will take Genesis from their own memory banks!
Put him on screen!  Study him well.
A twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. I mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
You're not going in there -- !
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
Exactly. Happy birthday.
Ah.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
We have received new orders. Upon our arrival at Regula I, all materials of Project Genesis will be transferred to this ship for immediate testing at Ceti Alpha VI.
... taking Genesis away from us...
Jim please --
This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I'm Doctor Marcus!
No. I -- I guess I'm not what you expected.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
The Admiral's son.
I shall avenge you --
Surely I have made my meaning plain. I mean to avenge myself upon you, Admiral. I've deprived your ship of power and when I swing round I mean to deprive you of your life --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Here it comes. Now, Spock.
Try the emergency channels...
Do it, while we have time.
Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out. Scotty, I've got to ask: Any chance of getting the mains back on the line?
I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
I see. Well, shall we start with the engine room?
Oh, no, sir! This is the finest engine room in the whole Star --
The word is given: warp speed.
'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...' Message, Spock?
Or the one.
How far?
It might help my analysis if I knew what Genesis was.
Yes.
WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And <u>why</u>?
It's all we've got.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Steady as you go...
Or the one.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
Who?
They just don't want us going in there.
At what.
Power levels quite low, sir.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
You've earned it. But I'm still grateful to have you at the helm for three weeks. I don't believe these kids can steer.
Aft thrusters, sir.
Ready, sir.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Humans make illogical decisions...
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
If you have a better idea - now's the time.
... My shoes...
Depends on how much shielding is between us and the reactor.
"Neutralized?" How?
We are launching everything we have.
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Then --
Flown... And that's the last you'll see of them?
I told you: I'm a sucker for hard luck cases. Besides, I want to know why you travel around with that ditzy guy who knows that Gracie is pregnant and calls you Admiral.
What do you mean now?
No, I'm from Iowa. I just work in outer space.
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
Kirk. They're gone.
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
Mr. Sulu: full power descent!
I belong here.  Suppose by some miracle you do get them through.  Who in the 23rd Century knows anything about Humpback whales?
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
Thank you, Admiral.
To the on-board computer room. To confirm my suspicion.
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
What are the variables...?
Judging by the pollution content of the atmosphere, I believe we have arrived at the late 20th Century.
Yes.
You mean profanity. That's simply the way they talk here. Nobody pays any attention to you if you don't swear every other word. You'll find it in all the literature of the period.
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Weapons systems?
Continue on course. Chekov, any signs of Federation escort?
Steady!!...  Now, Mr. Sulu!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Tell her I feel fine...
Arigato. Sayonara.  Thank you, honorable sir.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
... who wouldn't be tempted by the promise of perpetual youth? I don't think so.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
When time seemed to stop... and you could almost live in that moment...
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
I don't.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
And our people?
Until this week, that young man probably never saw a  machine, let alone one that walks and talks...
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk...
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
Good luck. Dougherty out.
How can there be an order to abandon the Prime Directive...?
Who are we to decide the next course of evolution for these people?
The concentration in the rings is what makes the whole damned thing work. Don't ask me to explain it. I only know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic reaction. After it's over, the planet will be unlivable for generations.
Do you know how to disable the injector?
Recommendations?
Do you have everything you need from command?
Fail-safe?
... had regenerated.
It may not last after we leave. If not, I just wanted, before we go...  I've never actually seen a sunrise.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
Even if it doesn't, they'll be teaching kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.
Fat chance. I'll post it on every monitor on the ship...
As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.
Actually, I was a good deal older when we arrived... in terms of my physical condition.
Yes... yes, I... can hear you...
I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a hypospray of lectrazine ready...
Make it so.
Evasive maneuvers... heading one- four-zero mark three-one...
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
And have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
We're here to find Zephram Cochrane. He may be injured or dead.
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
Are you saying they won't help us?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed.  Any word from the Enterprise?
You think they're still up there?
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I'm your creator now.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty...
Vulcan?
Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship?
Contact Starfleet Command.
According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg.
Power. There hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. Most of the batteries are depleted.
Outside, around back. Next to the water tank.
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be some kind of manual release...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
I'm on it...
Main bus...
Oh... here and there. You know how it is.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
Steady as she goes.
Aye, sir.
Onscreen.
I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
There were no planetary defense systems in this era. Their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
The charge is murder.
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Some people ARE afraid of the future; of what MIGHT happen;  I was frightened, really frightened.
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Killed trying to escape - it's a classic...
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
And what did they tell you?
Yes...
I am.
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Uhura, monitor!
Then all we've got is a neutron radiation surge - and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes...
I shall look forward to it.
I like it here...
He's got it.
And your coat.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
Candidate for what?
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
LET THEM DIE.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Not yet... Section 4236...
Who else?
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
An omission. After that -
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Mr. Scott, you forget yourself. Please accompany me.
That could take hours!
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
Aye, aye, sir.
Yes, sir.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
I know.
For how long?
I'm counting on it... We've been ordered to head to sector 3274. Starfleet is diverting the fleet to meet us there.
How far we've come. Let me know if you need anything.
And you were particularly aware of this feeling because Commander Riker will be leaving to assume command of the Titan?
Well. I suppose it does a bit. I'm very happy for them, of course, but I'm going to miss them. The ship will seem... incomplete without them.
We're about to find out... Power up disruptors and fire on my mark.
Yes.
Why is it moving?
I don't know.
I can feel your desire, Deanna.
There's something else. I was reviewing the sensor logs.
I'll take care of it, sir.
What are you doing to Counsellor Troi?
Listen to him, android. Such a small and weak creature. Yet he roars so valiantly...
Thank you, sir...
He's firing through his cloak. We can't get a lock.
Agreed.
Anything.
I intend to.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
And the Senate supports you?
And you're wondering why the Scimitar is so well armed. Is this the ship of a peacemaker? Or a predator?.
They sent me there to die. How could a mere human survive the dilithium mines? It was...  I was a slave. And a monster. The only thing the Romulan guards hated more than the Remans was me. But one man took pity on me: the man who became my Viceroy. He taught me how to survive. And in that dark place, where there was nothing of myself, I found my Reman brothers. They showed me the only kindness I ever knew.
And if you had lived my life you would understand that there is a great respons- ibility in representing the Federation. I can't let my personal feelings unduly influence my decisions.
I need a sample of your blood. What do your Borg friends say? Resistance is futile. 
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Long ago.
On my way.
Seven minutes.
None.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
We're only going to be here a few hours...
It's still the full price.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
Clarify that.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
You're not hearing me.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
That's the chance we have to take.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
What?
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Watch it. They're coming out.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
What are you doing?
Yes. Very good.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
My... husband.
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
It was yellow.
You better.
When we get here.
You want this ticket?
I was afraid.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
He will.
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
I feel better if I move.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You don't forget anything, do you?
What for?
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
My grandmother's rich.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
You have no conception of this, do you?
Very beautiful country up here...
We better get it into the box. Come on...
Hey, fuck you, man.
Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Fuck you.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
We should talk alone.
The killer knew right where she was. Because he put her there.
I can get you what you want.  You just have to talk to me.  I'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls.  I'm the Magic Man, the Santa Claus of the Subconscious.  You say it, you even think it, you can have it.  You want a girl, you want two girls?  I don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy?  You want to be a girl... see what that feels like? You want a nun to tie you up?  It's all doable.
Let's work it.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
Where's Faith?
You bet.  Did you like it?
You got froggy on me a couple times.
Sorry.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always bring you choice.
Who was just here?
You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Okay, take some executive... bored with his life, bored with his wife... he picks up a hooker or some girl at a bar.  Then he goes around for months, torn up worrying that he's got AIDS, that he'll infect his wife.  And maybe he really does catch something--
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Get it.
Sure, Lenny.  The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
It is my sword and my shield, Macey.
No idea.
Yeah.  I'm ghosting pretty bad.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
That's where it gets a little strange.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Lenny.  Calm down.  This is what I do.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
I don't think those cops did Iris. I think whoever Iris was wearing for killed her.
Right.  That explains it.
Are you going to make me beg?
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
Takes four days to chill, then its time to come back.  Is that...?
No, sir.
Ten miles back on the Texas side.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
Let's take a look.
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Hi there.
I want the autopsy report, where is it, Minnesota?
I'm sorry. This won't take long.
You know, you ever think about other women?
It's been wiped down a hundred times since then.
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
Maybe cause he's smart.
This better be important.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
I was looking for a pattern.
In Ft. Myers before your instruction. Nowhere else, sir.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Thank you, Rangers.  Put this man in the unmarked.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Not especially.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
A very sexy case.
Where's my watch? It's gone.
What's this country coming to?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
"Intra-Agency fraternizing."
But he believes in it. That's all that matters. He toyed with you, you toy with him. Convince him you've got a lead on Suspect Zero. Use Zero, you'll find Low.
I got an autopsy report from El Paso that doesn't seem right. A girl on Low's list. Karen Sumpter. We're getting a court order to exhume to body. I'd like you to come and look at it.  Don't worry, I've cleared it.
What's going on?
Burn marks. The original M.E. listed it as "burn residue." Same place, the outer thigh, as Karen Sumpter. The UNSUB is able to abduct, kill, transport and bury without detection.
I've got to take a piss.
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
I want to protect the boy. I also want to protect Suspect Zero -- from you.
The little piggie speaks.
Yeah.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
Excuse me, Agent Mackelway?
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
What do you drive?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
Yes. Like the quiche.
How?
To do what?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
Hey, man. At least it's Disney.
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Wait... Wait... Listen... So, I check the time and place. I'm where I'm supposed to be. I call my agent... She says they asked for me specifically...
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
Sorry?
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
Sure, I guess. The phone's in the back.
Yeah. And an actor.
It's not going to well?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
That's okay. I wanted to talk to you.
Really?
You don't call.
It's like "Hi, Mom. I'm not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I'm Goofy. Send more money."
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Darwinism at its best.
Ah, there's the rub...
...yeah, a month ago.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
Oh, like that song...
What's the point?
It's been two days. You should call that girl Nikki...
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
We ran into them that night at Roscoe's. Tee cleared it up, I apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. They fuckin love Tee. That boy can talk.
She's really special, guys.
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
Listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What Vegas?
We're going to Vegas.
Tonight, baby.
I'm cool, baby. They're gonna give Daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe Bennett's singing.
Baby, we're gonna be up by five hundy by midnight. Vegas, baby!
This is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. Tell me Mikey doesn't love pirates.
She smiled baby.
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
It's just that I've been out of the game so long. Trent, I was with her for six years. That's before AIDS. I'm scared. I don't know how to talk to them, I don't know...
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
We didn't do so bad after all.
No, baby. You're money.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
I just need some time...
It starts at eight...
It's on.
You looked right at her, baby.
Don't sweat it, baby. This one's a lay-up.
She didn't see.
We're not messing with you...
No, baby!
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
They're a bitch team... SCORE! Roenick!
You could make their heads bleed, though.
See, baby?
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...and fangs... and you're like "I don't know what to do. How do I kill this bunny?"...
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Be smart about it.
You owe the Don a service.  He has no doubt that you will repay it.
And what is that Bonasera?
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Probably all the other families will line up against us.  But, it's alright.  These things have to happen once every ten years or so...gets rid of the bad blood. You gotta stop 'em at the beginning. Like they shoulda stopped Hitler at Munich, they shoulda never let him get away with that, they were just asking for big trouble...
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
What percentages for my family?
Sure.
No, give him a living.  But never let him know the family's business. What else, Tom?
What miracles you do for strangers.
No.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
Calo and Fabrizzio are with me; nothing will happen.
Long ago.  Now there is nothing: the men killed each other in family vendettas...the others escaped to America.
You look good, too.
OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
No, no Consiglere.  Not this time. No more meetings, no more discussions, no more Sollozzo tricks.  Give them one message: I WANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it's all out war.  We go to the mattresses and we put all the button men out on the street.
No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
You like spaghetti?
Michael you're trying to scare me...
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
Michael.
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Oh Michael.
No, you eat...don't wait up for me.
Let HER ask.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
Then wait, Sonny.  Talk to Pop.
The kid's right.
Probably a year...
What guarantees can I give you?  I am the hunted one.  I've missed my chance.  You think too highly of me, my friend...I am not so clever...all I want if a truce...
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
Thanks.
Is my credit good enough to buy you out?
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I think so.  Detective squad?
Shut up!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
No, I like him.
Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
Oh, it was.
Yes please!
Okay.
Can you mix a martini?
No, I think your mother, her illness --
I love jazz.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Your parents met her.
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
No! I've got more than one shirt!
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
Relax. The most important question is where to eat. I hope Freddie made a reservation.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
Is Freddie here?
I thought you might write again. Now that we're brothers...
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam.
I'm actually a little relieved you're going, to be honest. I think we've seen enough of each other for a while.
Dickie?
No thanks.  Some kid at the American Express Office.  Are you living here?
Is it on "delle Croce, just off the Corso"? You're a quick study, aren't you? Last time you didn't know your ass from your elbow, now you're giving me directions. That's not fair, you probably do know your ass from your elbow. I'll see you.
Yes it is.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
San Remo. The police are amateurs. Well, my boy, it's come to a pretty pass, hasn't it?
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
He was thinking of you, Marge -- he asked me to deliver this.
Errand number one -- deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone.
I think you're right.
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
And you, sir? Any better?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
That was moving, wasn't it? When Meredith said --  Meredith's the American girl I saw last night, I know her, at the Opera, she's been seeing something of Dickie --
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
A hotel would've been fine.  We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
Hello.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
Are you a homosexual?  Interesting non-sequitur.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Well hurry, before we sink.  Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
Hi.  Sorry. You okay? You look as if you've seen a ghost...
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
He's already angry, I don't think --
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Nothing.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
I suppose I always thought -- better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.
Peter, I... I...
And don't forget. I have the key.
...Tom is a mystery...
I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him?
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Even her.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and I say to myself, that's a lonely girl. She needs a friend. And I'm gonna be her friend. 
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I bought a couple of tickets.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
I'm getting a taxi.
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
What taxi driver?
How long has he been there?
Ouch!
No, why?
What is it? I'm busy.
Just follow me.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
Ask Travis. He's the ladies man.
You said that?
The cops and company raise hell they find out.
Yeah. From the likes of them.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I can leave anytime I want.
But that one night?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He shoots dope too.
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. You should get rid of them.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I sure hate to go alone...
My work may take me out of New York.
Listen -- I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog!
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
There's porno theatres for that.
We don't need any misfits around here, son.
How's your driving record?
Why?
Anything you say, officer.
Take it or leave it.
O.K., cowboy.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
I'm not the chemical weapons expert.
Now they only have three rockets left.
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
I do?
I did?  Huh!
Well... where can we go?
Whoa.
No, you are.  I know exactly what you mean.  It's not that you're missing something.  It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
Have you got a cigarette?
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Yes, sir.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
I'm not refuting anything.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Um... no.  I don't have a statement at this time.
Listen to me!  The young man in there...
Exactly.  Break it to her gently.
Thanks.
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Nine and-a-half years...
Why?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
The film broke...
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
The G-man?
Sandra Sinclair.
No, sir.
I... no, I... I just can't...
No, I'm not much of a dancer.
Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
Exactly.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart!
The customers?  I don't know...
I thought you...
What exactly did you hear?
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
Yes.  Very.
Who?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
Yes, I did.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
And the second?
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
Look.
Could I have a puff?
Yes?
The two kids?
Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world...
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
A what?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
How long have you known her?
In a bird shop.
Yes.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
That's a chance we have to take.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I started to say... inside...
You don't have to.
What good will they do?
Do I sound foolish to you?
I wish I could be that way.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
I don't think I get you, Mitch. Do about what?
That's all right.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
Lovebirds.
Aren't these lovebirds?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
A little birdie told me.  Good day, Miss Daniels.  Madam. 
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
What kind of law?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
I'm sorry.  Who's your friend?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Seven o'clock then.
He was watching a ball game on television.
What?
Oh. That. Rome.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
Why?
What do you do?
You'll think me very bold, sir.
No, thank you.
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
Santa Rosa?
Almost two a.m.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Birds are not aggressive creatures, Miss. They bring beauty to the world. It is mankind, rather, who...
What were the crows after at the school?
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
They are incapable of organized warfare!
I haven't finished my drink.
I don't know that I can do that, Mrs. Marsh.
Yes.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
MacFarlane
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I thought only the best students were made assistants.
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
Wilmont used up the last spinal section.
Dr. MacFarlane, I wonder if you know what happiness you've brought those people.
No.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I'll not do it, Gray.
I've had some experience.
Oh, it's the bit of a girl Fettes was talking about.
And you're a fool, Toddy -- and no doctor. It's only the dead ones that you know.
The heart pumps it.
Here, have another glass, MacFarlane. I'll take you home and we'll be friends again -- now that you know that you're Knox's man and my friend -- aye, forever.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
Get out of here!
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Yes.
I know that you kill people to sell bodies.
I never heard that song. But what did they do?
That was Hare's end. Ah, you should have seen him on the streets, when he saw some old beldam deep in drink how he cozened her!
The cops from my trial. They killed Lauren. The whole thing was fixed. 
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
What's your damage, man? Corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
No. Listen to me. Lauren found out something they didn't want her to know.  This.
Erin. I'll always be with you.
But you, you've had them.
This guy said he was a friend of Lauren's. He had like paint all over his face.
What's that supposed to mean? He was right here. He was!
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About them. You've got to leave it alone.
The whole city has stopped. People are running around like ants!
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
It isn't faith that makes good science, Mr. Klaatu. Its curiosity.  Sit down, please. I have several thousand questions to ask you.
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
I leave that in your hands.
Yes.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Of course, dear.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
I was speaking of earth men. I meant the greatest philosopher -- the greatest thinker.
I shouldn't be at all surprised.
I thought that was only for bombs.
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
The President asked me to convey his deepest apologies for what has happened. We all feel--
About five months -- your months.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
We're very curious about that, too. Would you care to talk about it?
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
No, I'm a resident as of today and you'll probably be seeing a lot of me... I've been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you'd like to see my collection?
It's a pretty cool place if you're a Martian.
He's my brother.
Time to activate Plan B.
What's Plan B?
They pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  It wasn't our fault! They opened their eyes and talked!
Hey, take it easy.
No.  Stick around.
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
How do you know they're not?
Max?  You men we're having company again?
You have a T.V.?
Good!
Great.  I wanna get some new comics.
I thought we were goin' into town.
Promise me you'll keep it that way.  You're not like the others, Laddie.  You're like me.  I can still remember, too.
I like Michael.
Soon.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
No, I'm not...
-- a job.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
It's <u>garlic</u>!!  I like garlic, but...
I don't want to fight with you, Lucy.  Come on.  Let's give it one more try.  Dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I'm cooking.
Oh.  Your folks, too, huh?
I'm Michael.
Now you and David...
Take laddie.
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Just for a few days, Sam.  Give me a chance to work this out by myself.
Let's load 'em.
Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
Don't know.  Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Look Blair, maybe you're right about this.  But we've got to be rational. We've got to talk this over.  I'm unarmed and I'm coming in.
What?
If it did get to him.
Hell no.
No.  Just let him freeze out there.
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Was dark... find a light...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
How the fuck do I know?!
But...
Gee, thanks!
What for?
Then kill me.
They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
When was the last time you used it?
After all this mess then.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Extinguishers.
Forget about Childs.  He's over.
Calm down and get in your position.
Then we go after him.
Please, just listen to me... Your mother would be very cross with me if you got hurt.  I'll find her.
But there's nothing here.
1899.
Oh yes... They found our knowledge useful for a time.  They used us much as your people did.  Then they decided they had learned enough so they tore us up for spare parts.
You'll live like this forever. Alone.  You were meant to help.  To be with people.  Not like this.
Yes.
Imagine that... seems that little devil got my power relays...
Alexander.
Created?
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
There's a cantilevered gasket on the --
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
I want to get into the light, that's all.  Please...
So it's astronomy now, is it?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
Oh?
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
That's because I'm working.  You remember that?  You used to care about your work.
I know that --
Wasn't it?... I have a dream almost every night now.  The Lady and the Tiger, you remember that story?  In the dream I'm alone in a huge chamber with a thousand doors. Behind every door, save one, is a tiger.  I have to make the decision.  Which door conceals Emma?  And I just stand there... looking at the doors...
I would.
I'll tell you what... come by for dinner in a week and I'll show you.
His home.
Thank you...
Sir...?
Your husband is dead?
That machine --
Don't then have stars where you come from?
We all have that dream.
Or mud carriers.
If you only knew...
It's undamaged?
Mara --
Please, I beg you.  Take him away from here --
Tell him to go away --
I see.
Imagine that.
But I know that none of my faculty would ever deviate from the assigned curriculum.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
New Yorkers.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...
My God!  How can you just do nothing!?  They're your friends, your family.  You all knew Mara. You ate with her and worked with her... Your work in the valley, what is that for if not to --
Young man, we have a way of doing things here.  Radical theorizing is not acceptable.  Have I made myself understood?
And you've no idea where he went?
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
We never should have done this to him...
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Temporarily.
Yes.
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
How...how are you here?
It was part of the treatment I intended...I didn't know what the effects would be...
Oh yeah, what'd he say?
They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Oh, yeah.
I have no idea.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not.
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
Because I don't think I'm crazy.
It doesn't look all that different.
Because I don't have time.
What for?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Why?
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. [Resolutely, for her own benefit] It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
What.
Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
There's two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  And you blew it for 'em.  Now they've gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I'm gonna hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I've got no feelin' for you.  But I may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you're either gonna tell me every damn thing you know, so there's a small chance I can actually do them some good, or I'm gonna be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  Your misery is gonna be my goddamn mission in life.  That's a sincere promise.
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
Well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
Who do you think did it?
It's a nightclub, not a drive-in, Hal.  I don't follow the customers to the parking lot.
Oh, great.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready.  He's still too much of a kid himself.  He prides himself on being infantile.
Naw, honey, that would be burglary. I never got arrested for burglary. Burglary's for chicken shits.  If you're gonna rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  Just take the money.  That's robbery.  That's a whole 'nother deal.
I may be the outlaw, but you're the one stealin' my heart.
Why now, Jimmy?
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while.  I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun.  So let's have some!
I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way.  Do you understand that?
Our next move?  I'll say one thing, Louise.  This is some vacation.  I sure am having a good time.  This is real fun.
Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
No, I didn't tell him.  And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
I don't know.  I won't be.
It's probably not a good idea.
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
Nothing.  It got messed up.
You left that guy alone in the room?
Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Yeah.
Oh, come on!  Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Alright, Louise!
You know those little dogs you see people with?
We should have just ignored him.
What?  What's not funny, Thelma!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
About how fast was I going?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
What?
Yes.
What do you mean?
We can change our names.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
You're drivin'.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Pass him!
Does that mean suck my dick?
You're crazy.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
How do you stay so positive?
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
All this for us?
We're fine!  How are you?
I guess.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys.  Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Never?
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
Amen to that.
Out getting coffee.
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
Thanks.
I already know it, Mary.
It's right there on your golf bag.
You know...  ...the guys who ride the short bus.
A surprise?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
How about -- ?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
No.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
So she's married?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Surprised?
Your turn?
Same here.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
What do you mean?
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
I know how you feel -- I been standing in the same spot for the last five hours. You know it's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Oh. Well I am.
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
What's a mook?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
Are you all right?
Who's that?
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets.  God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
I agree there should be more.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Toy poodle!
Mary, come on...
Shhhhhh!
Shirley, get in here! You gotta see this!
I think I was very clear, Ted. If everything else falls apart, maybe.
Giddy-up.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
They're going to be pressing for a military solution soon. We can't afford to let them ram their agenda down our throats. We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here.
They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge. It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all, and they were just stalling for time.
I just checked myself.  They're being issued identity cards. Call comes, and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas. They go by helicopter to Mount Weather. We meet them there.
I think it's a bad idea.
Yes it is.
McCone's been notified and is coming back from the West coast. Carter's here, though.
Yes, sir. We can be sure we get all the missiles, and we remove Castro so this can never happen again.
What's happened?
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
What about you? Where are you going?
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
Jesus Christ...
Hey. Nice tie.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
-- don't "man" me, Jimmy. Where's the key?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
It ain't Geronimo.
Good. Thank you.
You ain't gonna cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once. Leo did quillwork, he's gonna need his hands.
The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
That's right.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
Watch out!
Medicine. As in medicine man?
What's real to you? Wall Street? Capital Hill? Now they are myths.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
You tell me. You tell me who went to the B.I.A. -- Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin' with your case, man. I don't give a goddamn about your case.
What the hell do you want me to do?!
Bullshit, let's get outta here,
Ray. What's your 20?
Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?
Get up!
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
All I know... is I did what I did... and I ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can't take this shit no more.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
Yeow!
Where were you?
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
There you go with those moves again.
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Thanks very much.  Care for some suchi?.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
And that's one!
I was, later.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Sir?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
He better be kidding!
Since when did you care about paperwork?
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
On what?
This is Maverick.
No shit. The Iceman....
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I can't eject.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
The girl with the purple fingernails?
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
IT'S MY SHOT.
LOOK OUT!
We did it.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
Speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  We're gonna get them wet unless we find a Sonoco station.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
No bother.
I called your house.
Not something they tell dependents.
What happened to them?
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Who is it this time--my mother?
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Yes, sir.
Why not?
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Not since you lost him.
You tell me.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
You blabbed, Quaid!  You blabbed about Mars!
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
I've got Quaid.
I've got him.  The guy in the turban.
Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
Doug...
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug, if outer space is your thing, I think you'd be much happier  with one of our Saturn cruises.Everybody raves about 'em.
As real as any memory in your head.
You're talking ancient history, Doug. Nowadays, traveling with Rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  Look at the statistics.
There's something I have to tell you...
Not any more.
This is too weird.
Then he dumped me on Earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
Because you're still working for Cohaagen.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
If Cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Like what?
I don't need Kuato for that.
You two-faced-bastard.
What reactor?!
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
...Who are you?
We were buddies in the Agency back on Mars.  You asked me to find you if you disappeared.  So here I am, good-bye.
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
One of these days, Melvin, somebody's gonna kick your ass.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
Listen!  Listen!  We know what they are!  They're big things under the ground!  Much bigger than we thought!  They're coming after you! They're coming right now!
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Forget it, man.  It's not worth it.
That's the plan.
Oh, you mean somebody who ain't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do?  Camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  We don't stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
Great.  Thank you.
<u>I'm</u> best at driving the Cat.
You are so full of shit...
Yeah, Val.
We have to go into Bixby in the morning.  The concrete blocks are in.
That's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.
Could be.
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Well, I'm supposed monitor these seismographs.  You know, they measure vibrations...
Yeah.  But I'll tell you, if you ever wanted proof God is a man, this is it.
And one good guy.
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
I suppose I could find an inmate who'd say that Shu boasted about Chinatown just to survive in the joint -- though he didn't really do it...
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can describe it.
Ah.
No further questions.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Damn right I'm right.
-- an angel dust dealer --
So go take your job on Wall Street.
-- Remember?
What other case?
...Are you sure we want that?
What, the lunatic who --
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
That's why I hate experts.
Let's get a cab.
...For ten years, now.
Neither.
Nothing has. But that's all changing.
EXACTLY!
-- About what?
I don't know shit, man! Goddammit --
They g-got the wrong g-guy.
Mr. Rabin has no right to --
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
-- But you just said you were personally involved with all the principals of the investigation.
You're trespassing into the area of witness protection, Mr. Dowd. Such showboating puts lives at risk.
That's right.
Chuckie OD'd, Mrs. Esparza. He's dead.
I would tend to plead the Fifth.
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
By "takes care of," you mean "kills".
The phone company was broken up.
A woman.
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
Thank you, Carl.
Did she have someone with her?
Oh.
Okay, Gordon!!!
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
Thanks.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
She must have known someone.
Esthetics are subjective, aren't they, Agent Desmond?  I'm Sam Stanley. If you ever need me.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
He probably wanted to drive over.
Maybe.
Call me.
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
You want a muffin?
No, you're the muffin.
Nothing.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Yeah... look in here. Look at it from this angle.
Bob.
Maybe.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
I'm so sorry, Laura.
It does matter. We're in love.
We were supposed to be together.
James...
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
What about tonight?
What's going on?
Everything, but everything.
You mean the ones you pity.
What are you talking about? Bobby didn't kill anybody.
See what?
Boating?
No.
You'd think so.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Now hurry, dinner's almost ready. Your father says he's starving.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, sweetheart.
A friend from school.
Yes.
No.
Laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  And look at this.
As if I didn't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
Come off it, Leo. I'm late for work...
There's no one here.
If Leo comes here, he won't believe that I am out doing the "Meals on Wheels".
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
The man's an ambulance chaser...
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
What does it mean?
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
Yes.
You've just said you signed it.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
Just as you are, Sir...
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Answer affirmatively. Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't 'part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist. Isn't that right?
When she...
We went to Code Blue...
...We did everything we could...
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
Tell us.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I'm going to have you disbarred. I'm going to have your ticket. You know what you did? Do you know what you did?
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Well...
I... given the limits of your question, that's correct.
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps. Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
That's perfectly all right. I'm kind of rushed. Do you mind if we walk while we talk?
...and you're going to do that?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Mrs...
I used to be a nurse.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
That's what I'm going to try to do.
What...?
You're talking like a drunk.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
I have to reach him. This is an emergency. Could you give me his home number?
Kathy Price.
I didn't do it, Mister.
I do. Who is it? The Doctors. What do you owe them?
...I'm sure you do...
...and I have inquiries out to doctors, experts in the field... there is, of course, a problem getting a doctor to testify that another doctor's negligent...
Thanks, Franky.
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
I can't talk now.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Yes.
Yes, the roving nurse...
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
How'm I doing so far?
Let's go.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
All right - I've seen enough!
But I think I know where she'll be....
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Why, sure -- I got it!  Do you have a match?
Like...ah...
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
If they're mortal, they must have mortal weaknesses.  They'll be stopped -- somehow!
It was...  ...one of them!
It's blocked here, too!  They've pushed up earth or something all around outside.  Here, this way...!
It's pointing out to the gully - where that meteor came down.
It might give us something.
I believe we can get a lead from their anaemic blood.
No.  I thought you had them.
From the data - and from that picture the Air Force took earlier tonight ...  ... what we've got in the gully out there is a guide ship.  One lands ... Others follow later.  They appear to clear an area, then drop in groups of threes, joined magnetically.  Is that possible?
I've done about all I can do here. You go back in.  Sylvia - I like that Doctor Forrester.  He's a good man.
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
I'm sure we can match any offer.
Yes, but...
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
You've got to get back on the horse some time.  Look, you've had a nutcase making harassing phone calls.  I know how scary that feels.
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
They were safe and could sleep.
You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
Home, that's right.
Coming for you...
Read me some?
Holding my own.  You know that guy who was calling me all the time?  He's started again.  He's been putting stuff in my mail.
Yeah, sure.
Yes?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Exactly.  The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned.  However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.
Then what is he doing?
Your father?
Guilty.
Phil, he's not looking inside.  He's just striking out at the world.
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Yes, Sir.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Fifteen.
Yeah, sure.
Well, Romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Believe what?
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Figured what out?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Nobody says you have to be like me.
You only hurt yourself you know?
Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
I guess.
We all have problems.
That is the point... And Skipper'll slip off the hook.
I know you will.
I'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  I guess that's what I thought it would be out here.  But, it's not is it?
He left his passport in Curacao. It's being mailed to Panama.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
Indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
Oh, really?
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
Not a chance.  Remind them that according to the Geneva Convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
How the hell are we gonna get outta here?
Why would you do that?
Then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, Mr. Lawford.
Nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
But, they don't speak English.
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Then keep your mouth shut.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
He's so ugly. Guys with beards and beer guts ain't quite my type.
Then lemme throw in a couple more things.
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?...  Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
What's that?
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Juana called. They're stayin' another week.
What'd you say?
No, of course.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
Thanks.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
We were. Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and I are on our way back to Utila, in the morning.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Do you know Honduras, Johnny?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's got an appliance shop.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
In many capacities.
He is my sponsor. The General is the head of the secret police of Honduras.
I think they are too serious, these American fishermen. In Honduras, we are not so concerned with the method.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
What's that, peanut?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
We got through two states already.
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
If you say so.
Yeah?
I'll come along.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
Went with Bobby.
Let's leave here.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Santos... I can't...
That's just another part of the price to pay.
Where we goin'?
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
What?...
By who?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
That's pretty simplistic, don't you think?
You're stoned.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
He is. Take my word for it.
His parents.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
Plenty, I'm sure. But, for what it's worth...
Ye-es?
Great. Between you and Officer Pupcik out there he can be the next Jean Genet. It's been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
Bad examples. Look, Tripp, I don't want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Bullshit.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
How long have you been smoking marijuana?
Shut up.  Cupcake. Please. Inside.
Where are you, Grady? An elevator?
Just what? Doing a little dusting?
No. Sara, you don't understand...
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
Really? That's remarkable.
The one she wore on her wedding day?
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
Right.
Okay, okay. Take it easy. Don't freak out on me.
You?
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
Blocked.
Well done, James.
The bus station.
But James. I mean... How long?
No.
Colon cancer.
Jesus, James. Wow.
Carvel? Where's Carvel?
You're mad at me, aren't you?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
It wasn't her dog. It's her husband's --  Who said anything about girlfriend?
Not you. Your talent.
Arsonist's Daughter meant something.
Even if I end up going to jail....
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
I got the message you called too.
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
She's left the room before. She always came back.
Hm.
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Neither do I.
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
Totally. I'm sorry. A lot was happening this morning. Can you talk?
Oh. Right. Ha. Listen, about last night. There is something I need to tell...
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
About the baby.
Grady.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
I lost it all.
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
He'd call it habit. But now... I get the feeling he's going through the motions a bit.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
That's weird.
No shit.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
When can I see her?
Huh?
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
The birthday party.
When?
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
I'm just talking, man.
Birds.
A solitary vireo. I like that one.
How does it sound?
I bet you can.
I have friends.
Robin.
You can't talk to me like --
The one with the ax?
Little Red Riding Hood.
No.
I was asleep.
You're a cop. Figure it out.
Yes.
I'm adjusting okay.
It gives me headaches.
They sound like finches.
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
Do I take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
That was a joke.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
You think reflection is good.
It's very good, indeed.
No fucking way.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Rosen? I don't have a problem with that.
You have no feelings for your niece?
I know --
I don't know.
What did you want to happen?
Is this the first one?
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
You mean my problem?
If by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
To relax.
In my bed too.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
You felt pleasure.
All right. A small house... with small rooms.
How do you feel about that?
What's weird about that?
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
K through sixth.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
You must hate it.
Yeah, they could.
You're damaged.
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Not tonight.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
I suffer from insomnia.
It's not what you think.
Hey, I'm not --
Why young girls, Walter?
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
All three -- in chronological order.
I've got problems.
I need a shower.
Where're you?
She went front-office on you.  Tighten that for me, right there.  That's it.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
Hi, Lins.  I thought you were in Houston.
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake.  I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
No.  Look, forget it.  I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know.  I DON'T KNOW!
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
No.
Can we negotiate later?  There's Big Geek.
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
They'll come out after us.
I don't know how!
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
That's cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
Missed what?
Give me that!!
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Check this out.
I don't know... It depends on Ettore... He's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in Sicily...
But I think we should talk about it. Or are you fully convinced that we too won't understand each other?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Then why don't you try it on?
But how could you say such a thing?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
At what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
That seems to apply to you also...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
So, even if I did say them, I was sincere with her, as I am now with you.
That's why I asked you...
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
Why?
I don't doubt it. But at a time like this we're the least suitable persons to be with him. And as far as telephoning him... Who knows where he is?
Aren't you going to change?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Have you ever been in love?
But then why did you bother changing?
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
If it rains, I'll buy myself an umbrella.
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
No, not like this one.
I know, I know. One thing at a time.
Thank you.
I don't see why I should mind.
Ettore must be fed up with me by now.
Yes. Until proven otherwise.
No.
Because...
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Who told you this?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Dear Jesus...
Why?
I burnt them.
Yes, Mother.
Say it!
What would you like to talk about.
Yes.
Oh, there are so many.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Do you think he loves you?
Something I ate.
From God.
Anything.
Not at the moment, no.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Like what?
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
No.
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint... 
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
I'm always bad.
What did you do?
Yes?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
No I'm not.
To help me.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Why?
Who?
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
Yes.
Agnes... Agnes...
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
Yes.
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
???
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's your favourite...
Marie's dead Mama.
Uh huh.
Who told you this?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
Unfiltered.
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
How did she hide it during the day?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Could there have been anyone else?
What's your opinion?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Not simple, no.
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are?  You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud. 
I am...
There's another choice.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
Nothing...
Mary Magdelen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I'm concerned about her health.
My God, but you're determined.
The baby?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
You tied the cord around its neck.
We'd be thrown out.
The cards... you're bank.
I'm a deserter.
Are you now?
Ding Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?
How about Ding Dong?
He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
Isn't it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.
You do - repeatedly.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Ah well. Eh, look!
Oh aye, but I thought ...
Are you pulling my leg?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Thank you.
Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?
What's that mean?
They ought to be.
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Parading's better!
That's it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Nothing good.
Is there a fire, then?
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Yeah ... so what?
We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
So's mine.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
I would though.
Aye, let's try the dressing room.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
And my nose...
Is it?
It's all over the place, everyone knows.
Well, that's just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?
Oh, leave off!!!
I knew it, <U>he</U> started it, I should have known.
You've lost him.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
I don't need you to defend me, y'know, Norm.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Get knotted!
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
It's... basalt.  Rock.
You want to try?
No, I want to go in.
Yeah, I'm okay.  Haven't hit bottom yet.  Definitely a column of warm air rising; it keeps the shaft clear of dust.
Don't you remember?
What?  <u>Why</u>?
What?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Dead!
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Well we better do something.
Poison gas...
But this thing uses it for <u>blood</u>.
The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
Can you do anything for him?
Oh my God.
Let me go first; you stay behind me.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
No.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
How many?
I think it's fizzled out.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Can't tell -- these weather conditions could erode anything, fast.
Sun will be down in a minute.
It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it.  The line could get tangled in something.
Is it still dripping?
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
They're on the next level up.
What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?
Let's hear it.
Well, it's finally happened.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Found what?
I've always respected your opinion, Martin.  If something worries you, it worries me.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
Even simple.
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Sure.
Yeah...
Do you wanna head back and call it in?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Force the door.
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
One more sweep... one more sweep.  I'm getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. We're been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
That's a fact.
What's wrong?
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
What do I think?  I think if those Marines from Powell don't shift their butts getting here, we're gonna get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
What can I do?
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
Nah, I'll stick it out for another hour or so.
'Bout five minutes.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Stars.
Almost four.
You could sleep, too, couldn't you?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
What else?
She doesn't know.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
It is true that your parents were poor. They still are. And they would like to know how you are - and where. They haven't heard from you for three years...
Yes, Addison.
Because I don't want to.
Gable. Why a feller like that don't come East to do a play...
Then you've heard too.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
We have that in common.
To the best of my recollection, neither your name nor your performance entered the conversation.
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
I'll try.
As of this moment you're six years old...
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
Who?
Okay. Mix.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
It's time you found out. I love you.  I love you. You're a beautiful and intelligent woman-  - a beautiful and intelligent woman and a great actress-  - at the peak of her career. You have every reason for happiness-  - every reason, but due to some strange, uncontrollable, unconscious drive you permit the slightest action of a kid-  - kid like Eve to turn you into a hysterical, screaming harpy! Now once and for all, stop it!
I've been aware of that for some time.
I'll say.
Come on, get up. I'll buy you a drink.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Just wondered what?
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Of course not.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
I'm for it.
- and for you.
I'm only human, rumors to the contrary. And I'm as curious as the next man...
Buy some.
Oh, brother.
Night an' day.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
I might.
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...  ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...  ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
There can't be very much-
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented...  ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
Over my dead body...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Right here.
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter...  I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
I just can't believe it.
In a minute...
That's on time for Margo.
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
Now just a minute-
You - for one. I told her you were set on Margo playing the part - and I certainly wouldn't make a change without your approval.
Margo!
Nothing much. She apologized.
Nothing...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I know what I'm talking about, after all they're my plays...
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
She is a louse.
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
I didn't hear you.
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
I was sure trying.
What, though?  It can't be the Republicans--he'd never allow something as stupid as this, not when he's gonna slaughter McGovern anyway.
Hmm.
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
About the past year.
--I know a lawyer at Justice--
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
It's nothing personal, though. 
Goddamnit!--
I know where Dwight works.
But you know who did.
Chapin did contact you then?
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--goddamnit, when's somebody gonna go on the record on this story--
Carl, it's a jungle.  I suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.  You'd give a stranger the shirt off your back--except it wouldn't be paid for.
Give me your checkbook then.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
I don't know what they'd do to me.
We're a long way from high school, Carl...  ...and I'm scared.
Just let me get a match.
Think Sloan's being set up as a fall guy for John Mitchell? Sometimes it looks that way.
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
We were never told flat out "Don't talk." But the message was clear.
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
Ben, Jesus, there are over two thousand reporters in this town, are there five on Watergate? Where did we suddenly get all this wisdom?
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
--he went to her apartment and he told her--
Electronic surveillance.
Clearly, I am here, but only as an individual, I'm not the attorney of record.  Mr. Rafferty has that position. Whatever you want, you'll have to get from him, I have nothing more to say.
Probably you're right, but a little while ago, I was talking to a couple of lawyers who'd been assigned to represent the burglars.
A Miami social occasion?  Mr. Rafferty told me the Cubans were from Miami.
--I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
I'm a proper citizen, I'm a decent man, I don't do anything that isn't decent or proper.  I know I shouldn't tell you this...
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Ratfucking.
You'll have to find that out, won't you.
Where in government?
Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
Two o'clock, work the phones 'til you go.
I did all right on McCord.
Then how come the Associated Press were the ones found out that Mr. McCord is security coordinator for the Committee to Re-elect the President, otherwise known as CREEP?
Lotsa hints--
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
He just did.
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Like what?
Oh no, no date.  Bathroom incident.
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
No, no, that's what the cretins drink. I mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
Uh-huh.
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You can call me Oz.
Neither will I.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
You want onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
...yeah.
This isn't any better, Chris.
What?  We both have cars.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Please.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
...I've never tried it.
But that one time --
Yeah, that's right.
You think she was serious?
It's all good.  Breath check.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
Yeah, enormous.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
That's great.  Now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  Or, as I always called it --  "Stroke the salami!"  Ho-ho, Jim.  There's nothing to be ashamed of.  Hell, I'm fifty-two, and I still enjoy masturbating.  Uncle Mort masturbates.  We <u>all</u> masturbate.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Dad!!
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night?  That Ariel, whew.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
C-Span?
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer --  Cool Hip Jim...  or Laid Back Jim?
No.  Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  I don't think they liked it.
Did you see that Central chick? Brunette?
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Yes, slowly.
Um...okay...
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Tonight?
How?
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Indeed I did.  But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot.  It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
No...I know the perfect time...
Yeah.
I love you.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
What?!  How do I do that?
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Shut the fuck up.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
Yep.
Uh huh.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Yeah. French fries...
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
What?
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
No... I...
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
Why the fuck would I do that?
AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
What do you mean, maniacs?
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
I know, but I had to because . . .
When you're older . . .
Get on! Anastasia, get on!
Then come find me.
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess!  Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
Anastasia's grandmother is in Paris.  We're going to bring Anastasia to her - in Paris. 
I was all out of dynamite!
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
How do you know?
He's her?
Ew. . .  the honest type.
Royalty do not help people with their luggage.
What do you mean?
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
Please, if you'd just listen...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
Oh good! We haven't seen an Anastasia in several days!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
What's your name?
Come on.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
How can you possibly oversleep?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Oh, you do?
You want your tennis stuff?
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Well, who's Sadie?
Uh, narcolepsy.
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
what I mean?
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
It's terrific.
What?
Gimme a kiss.
Okay?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Oh, yeah?
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Don't you think I do?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
Mine.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment.  Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
Uh-uh-why?
Were you always funny?
Yeah.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
M'hm.
Yeah.
and I keep, you know, it's-
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Oooh.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez.  Don't worry!  I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you-  whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
What... huh?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Yeah.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
I did.
Commentary.
What-
Key word here is "indulgent."
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
Trigger.
Hey.
Right before his un-American thing.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
May I see your license, please?
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Well, sit down.
You all right?
Yeah. Right.
She was going through my pocketbook!
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Oh, yes, yes.
We're going to take them to the airport.
No, no, no, not at all.
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Yeah.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
There's a whole wing in this house.
And here, you just-
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Would it make a difference?
I'm not that good.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
No, what?
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
Of course.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
I'll change back before we leave.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Dander.  He's allergic.  Otis.
He's not going tonight.
You really need to be fucked.
Let's go upstairs, okay?
Harry called.
Leave us alone right now.
Nice to meet you.
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
Are you always this much fun?
Anytime, sport.
Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you.
Did you invite them?
Did you tell Joe to behave?
I'm ready.
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
It's a shit novel anyway.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
Don't.
Don't push me away.
You changed your mind.
I'll never forgive you.
I guess.
Will you make love with me?
I'll do it.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you.
Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
They're nothing like us.
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
God willing.
Why?
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Thank you.
That was my clue.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
She's all over him, are you blind?
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
I don't want to talk about it.
That's not an answer, is it?
You don't need to thank me.
From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle...
You're keeping a record, are you?
I don't mind...
And here they are!
Like Joe.
It's much more personal in here.
A notch above the storage room.
His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
Not nice.  Not kind.
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you don't have other plans.
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
The palace, hunh?  I bet those royals really live it up.  Of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
Really?
You -- you think I'm right?
Let me think.  Hmmnn...  Never.  Bye!
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
How should <u>I know</u>?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
Wait, I hear something!
Listen, "Princess", you can't order me around.  Out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
So what makes you so special?
Well...I <u>am</u> the oldest.
Then if I go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  Anyway, don't worry. No one will recognize us in our disguises.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Mom!
Trial membership?  Kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
Attack?  But -- I hate attacking! It's so hostile!
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Oh, no, sir!
That's correct, sir!
ONE TO NOTHING!
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...Not enough food?
'Fraid not, your majesty.  Goodbye, your majesty.
Alright, let's move out!
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Yeah, I know.
I mean - barging in on your mother -- in the middle of the night?
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Really?  I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
That's me. 
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
How is your cold?
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
What kind of talk is that?  So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
No -- I don't want anything.
What's her first name?
Give what up?
A bad insurance risk?
Gin.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Gin.
Would you mind opening the window?
For me?
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Where?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Cheers.
I mean, after that?
So I want you to keep a clear head.
I never thought he'd do it.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
You do?
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
I'm not through with you yet.
Now put down the key --  -- and put down the address.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will.  Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
I know how it is.
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me.  This way, Baxter.
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
Fran been sick or something?
You?
Who else?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch.  I didn't recognize your voice --
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
Oh, that's not me.  It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying?  Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Well, I have things to do --
You got a girl-friend?
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
My shoes.
Who?
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
I missed you, Fran.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I want you back, Fran.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
Remember what we talked about?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
Baxter?
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Don't you ever stop talking?
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
You can keep your fucking fuel --
Which part is that ?
What unit were you with ?
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
Fat. That's real fat.
We do.
A long time.
A year ? Waiter another beer.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
What did you put in all those ammo boxes?
God knows.
Let's go.
We found some bodies -- let's get out a here.
This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes.
While you were sleeping.
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Maybe.
Anyone got a cigarette.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war.
No, sir.
I am not presently disposed to discuss that, sir.
How big it is?
Six to eight feet.
You want'a surf, soldier?
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
Hairy ?
I love it.
What Truth?
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him.
Yeah... thanks.
Then let's get the hell out of here.
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
Bring your rifles, that's all.  Take us to him.
You're Australian?
I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too.
Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads.
We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance.
We were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
What did you hear?
Well who the hell verifies that ?
Beverly Hills --
89   CONTINUED:
Wait 'til I'm across!
Inside of three hours you'd be dragging my dead carcass.
139  CONTINUED:
There isn't one, unless Corbett's men get here before the plane does.
Had some good years.  Met her in '66.  She showed up one day in Coldfoot.  No one knew her.  One Sunday morning, she marched into a bar and announced she was available as a wife to the highest bidder.  Didn't work out in three months, she'd return the money and leave, no hard feelings.  My bid was eight thousand dollars.  Beautiful girl.
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
The little creep hates it that Eric actually does what the company hired him to do.
Going after killers isn't the same as chasing poachers, Eric.
Leave my traps.  We'll tag up, couple days.
Yeah.  Maybe so.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
Pushing it is flat wrong.  All you prove is your ignorance about breaking trail.
Sure.  The People's Friend.  Kiss your ass with precision if there's a vote in it.
You got one?
An appetite.  Maybe you won't die after all.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
Ben...boys.  Yeah, real slow, and I'd like to keep it that way.
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp.  Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What are you talking about?
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
What does this matter to you?
You can't see past your lousy little assignment, sniffing around the pipeline.  The few voters there are in this district look up to Corbett, and I'm not about to alienate them.
We'll go with you.
I could've sat tight for the transport, 'til Bob came poking around.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Get the fuck out of here.
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Where's the kid?
I want us to go out.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Don't be silly. How bad?
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
Yes.
What needs clearing up?
I want you to go on this trip.
Melvin, I'd rather not.
No.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Go ahead.
Were you asleep?
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
Do it.
About a dog.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Verdell?
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me...  it's not affection. It's a trick.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I'm going back with you.
I'm coming.
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Okay... you tell me why --  "You're dying here."
Did you like it that much?
Picking on me won't help.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Look, I'm real tired and I'm not interested in fucking chit-chat.
It's just a shoot-out then.  Sixty- forty, at best.  Not my odds.
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Who the fuck cares about Cleveland. Cleveland blows.  What kind of marks have they got here?  Greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  I want the money marks. I want the marks that you get.
There's a sand barricade up ahead; I'm going to ram this cab into it. The cab has an airbag, odds are good I'll survive.  But with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
I ain't scared of you.
Yeah you are and you hate it.  You hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  That you're sweating your balls off and I'm not. You've got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
You would be.
You're too late.
They money will be standard bank transfer.  We believe we will know where and when.
I don't believe you.
I'm worried about you, Robert.
One hour per man.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
No, stay in the car.  I want you to understand something.  If I intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
'Them'?
Why?
Then you can have the disks and I'll just walk out that door --
They recruited me when I was in high school.
Why did you leave the Agency?
Are they usually like that?
You said you didn't trust it.
Good.
Mexico.
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Here?
In Costa Blanca.
Really?
How was the beach?
That means you won't have a gun.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I told you, he will.
I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
Then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Who was she?
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
Martin.
What?
Yes.
Everyone regrets something.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
And pay for their drinks occasionally.
I used to think he was right about a lot of things but now I don't know. I thought he was going somewhere but now I think I am wasting my time.
Sounds cool.....Do you think he's serious about squatting a place?
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
And not even then sometimes.
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Never heard of K-MART?
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
Care to elaborate?
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
I thought that was part of the charm!
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Yeah, I'll take some.
We don't speak Czech!
No beer?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
No, the boyfriend.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
So I hear.
Honza says they'll print an open letter to President Havel in next weeks edition even if they have to threaten a walk-out.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
WE gotta think of something.
Now you're using that word.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
No!
Yeah, pretty well.
So am I.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
They didn't look like medical files to me.
I think he's jealous of Havel.
Whatever!
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
Don't worry. Thanks.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
How?
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
Thanks.
I had it coming from someone.
Cool!
Fuck you!
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
You may use my office.
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
No problem, is it at your place?
But I have to finish this....
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Why?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
The storage facility will be ready within a week, I'll call you then.
I'm sorry about how we --
Why not?
Cuz nothing happened at school.
About a job.
-- I like the car I have.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Me neither.
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
York Ave.
Scamming's a strong word.
You.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
'They won't.'
Like me.
So you agree you need help?
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
In ten words or less?
You don't miss a thing.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
No.  But are you -- impressed?
I have to get you home by one.
We're doing something -- ?
Not possible.
Pull over.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
I don't want to come here anymore.
That's what I mean.
I don't want you to see him outside school activities.
Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon --
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
Yes, sir.
Ever again.
I want to come back.
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'd work backstage or something?
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Yes, sir!
Fine.
Oh yeah.
Uh, hi....
You do?
What drill?
Oh yeah.
Lemme see that.
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
Not a holocaust --
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
The appropriate question to ask is when the hell is he! You see, Shemp has just become the world's first time traveller. I've sent Shemp into the future -- two minutes into the future to be exact.
Oh. That expression probably hasn't been invented yet... I can get behind -- I agree with you.
We don't....
Professor, be serious, would you?
You forget -- time travel is instantaneous. The time machine would melt, but you would have already travelled through time. Of course, it's a moot point regardless. The only place atomic bombs are detonated is at the Army's Nevada Test Site, and those tests are kept absolutely top secret.
Believe me, Professor, running around on a nuclear test site can't be any more dangerous than what I've been doing.
Professor, if something does go wrong tonight... if I don't get my parents back together... when do you think I'd cease to exist?
You don't mind?
Yeah.
Sometimes. The other day, though, an old boy was plowing in the field over there, found some old Spanish coins.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Thirty aught six.
They're okay.
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
What's your friend's name?
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Something mi trabajo.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
But it would hurt.
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
Yeah.
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
I don't blame him.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Maybe.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
It's mine all right.
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
She wants a picture.
Let her out. In my custody.
Let her out?  She's a killer.
It?  Who does?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
She was killed, Penny.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Penny--?!  Are you all right?
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?
Why me?
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
What. What don't I understand?
...Who is this?
No, but the whole goddamn – Audrey? Have you ever had to read any of Bill's wrestling scenarios?
Before what?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
I want to know how many of Bill's books you wrote!
All right, forget the heads. Where's Mundt, Fink?
Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' things up. Yessir. Escape... It's when I can't write, can't escape m'self, that I want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. Mm...
I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're producing this Wallace Beery picture I'm working on.
Then who should I talk to?
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
I'm afraid I don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
A souse!
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
Well what do I tell him?
Well, I'm... glad to hear that –
Well, I'm a writer, actually.
Can be. Not easy, but –
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Charlie. How are you.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
Hold on –
But I didn't do it – don't you believe me?
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
Funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. I guess... I guess it's kind of pathetic.
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
Never heard of it. Let's move him to the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool.
Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.
Yes sir, they –
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
I'm checking in. Barton Fink.
Uh-huh.
No kidding, bright boy – we smelt Mundt all over this. Was he the idea man?
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
You two have some sick sex thing?
When did you start drinking again?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I know who you are.
Were you with him last night?
Yes.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
You can make a mistake.
Not me.
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
It's not the same thing, is it?
Yes.
To see if I can get away with it.
I know.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
When?
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
It won't sell.
Somebody has to die.
Somebody always does.
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
Do you remember his name?
What kind of talk?
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Hallelujah.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop?  She doesn't know me.  I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
She want to play?  Fine.  I can play.
I know what that's like.
Say what?
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
How did they die?  Was there an investigation?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down.
Can you check again?
Rene's been telling me about your work.
Not sure. How was yours?
Why, so you could humiliate me?
Saddle River's in New Jersey.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg.
That girl looks just like my old girlfriend Gina.
Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
Who?
Just look at him.  Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.
You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Yeah.
Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny.  "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken!
I am... On Gina.  Fuck – I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Don't give him anything, man. Your art's worth a lot. Trade. That's what real artists do with each other. Besides, he'll just use you. He's famous for that.
Party girls? Can I call you?
I hadn't thought about it.
What's that?
Forget it.
Thanks
You're a fast mover.
Singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
So what?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
Yeah.
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
Things change.
Oh.  "Kyle."
"We"?  You and...
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Well ... How can I put this. There were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. Because <u>I</u> had trouble reconciling them.  Vicki said.
Ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
Wayne, I'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  If my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Down, Oswald.  We have to talk.  You see we've got something in common.
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
I want in.  The thought of busting Batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  Maybe I'll give myself a bath right here ...
Dad!  Save yourself!
My lips are sealed.
No, just give you a splitting headache.
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
Yes, adulation is a cross to bear. God knows <u>I</u> know.  But someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress Mayor and don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot, you've got the magic!
I damn well better be.  In fact I want you to phone those goniffs over at Gotham Insurance and tell them --
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
In spirit only, I'm afraid.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Women.
I recognized the accent.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I wish I knew.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
I'm scared, Dick.  Maybe for the first time in my life.  I'm really scared.
Like hell you do.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
To be frozen.  To never change.  A life of perpetual ice-olation. There is little perfection in that.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun.  He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
I believe you said the same thing about the Batmobile.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
Ninety-three, including the sauna.
He killed them. Two-Face. He slaughtered that boy's parents.
Actually, he took the car.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
But 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. What do they mean?
How about, MR. E.
Enigma.
Master Wayne's dead wives.
Why's that?
Last night at the circus. I noticed something about Dent. His coin. He's obsessed with justice. It's his Achilles' heel. It can be exploited.
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
Exactly!
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Wait. You can't go.
No. Don't leave me! My invention! I need you!
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Exactly.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
So how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of Batman?
Chase. There's something I need to tell you--
Listen, Dick. Killing Two-Face won't take the pain away. It'll make it worse.
What I do isn't about revenge.
You have a real gratitude problem. You know that, Bruce? I need a name. Batboy? The Dark Earl? What's a good side kick name?
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
Let me ask you something, Bruce. What is man's greatest tool?
What the hell is going on here?
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
Never heard of a double-cross?
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
... Very good, sir.
WHICH CAR?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word.
Because I...  ... Because she'd never speak to me again.
No.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I feel naked without it.
The does it. It's going to be this weekend.
Vicki. Do you love half of me? Or all of me?
WHAT??
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Very good idea, Jack.  In fact --  -- I'd like you to handle this operation personally.
I've considered that possibility.
Goddammit, I expect to be treated like and ARTIST. GET OFF MY SCREEN!!
Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Miss Vale, was it something I said?  Do you want to sniff my flower?
What were you thinking?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
There aren't hotels?
Ahm - he's male.  He's English.  He's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  I think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  I think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  Stupid thing.
It's okay.  There's no one out here. Just open the door.  Trust me.
David, I'm serious!
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
Ah, well .... CUT TO:
No, I'm fine.
Uh ... yes ...
Ahm.....
It's great when people who work together can become real friends.
We have.  In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
Yes, although, I really..... thank you.  Yes, it's great to have him with us. The whole family's very excited.
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of time to make up.
Welsh.
Jennifer!  This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  Please - talk to me.  I promise to be reasonable.
Why thank you sir.
Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be casinos and lights and stuff.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Heh heh. This is the best night of our lives.
Me first!
Heh heh. Thank God.
You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh huh.
Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh... I think you scared them off.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Um... ass... head...
Yeah, we're gonna score.
Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Cut the power!
D.C., Chief.
Not now Bork.
Yup. Huh huh.
Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  You don't have to answer now.  He wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  You take your vacation, Adam.  Say 'bye!
God, how I have looked forward to this, honey.
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.  Let's just relax about having children.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
What?
That's how long you were gone.
Won't?  Or can't?
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
Draw door?  I don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
This is different.  Eventually she'll take someone to the attic. And then what?  We've got to try to contact this guy Betelmyer. We gotta get some help, hon.
Just a hunch.
D-90's.  You spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one D-90 intercessions with Juno. You probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I go!
You wish!  I nearly scored with that little blonde.  I need me a short little queen.
Well, we didn't know --
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
I want to be dead too.
Life is just... too awful.
Where'd they go?
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Yes.
Just <u>say</u> it.

Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
There's only one Chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are Irish and Irish people happen to cook Cantonese.  They don't know better.
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up there, ya hear?
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
Of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  Just a little startled.  One of those sushi dropped down my Kamali.
Viridian?  What is...?
Of course, her favorite color! How <u>beautiful</u>!
Be brave!  Otho take care!  Onward!
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
That's slavery and murder.  You don't know these people.  They're just like you and me.  They're nice people!
Yes. Are you planning on making any sort of claim against the Rand's?
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Thank you, Robert.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
... But he's...?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
It's feeling better, but it's still very sore.
Your family doctor?
No. I'm a gardener.
Yes. It's feeling much better now.
Yes.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
I like the President. He is a very nice man.
Thank you, Eve.
I like to watch.
... But I've never done...  ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
That's very interesting, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Yes. I've been looking for you, too, Eve.
Hello, Morton.
I don't want Robert.
Your foot! Give me your foot!!
I agree.
Bravo! Bravo! Our chairs are indeed almost touching! And we want to remain seated on them, correct? We don't want them snatched from under us, am I right? Because if one goes, the other goes, and then - boom! Boom! And we are both down before our time, you see? And neither of us wants that, do you agree?
Oh, good.
Yes. I like that name very much.
Thank you.
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Thank you, Ben. The garden that I left was such a place. Everything which grew there was with the labor of my own hands. I planted seeds and watered them and watched everything grow.
I could give it some thought, Ben, but my leg is very sore.
I understand.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Yes, Ben - are you going to die now?
Oh, I see.
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
I can't write.
Yes. Of men and women.
Good day, Sally.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
I assure you, sir, David is a very careful driver. Please, won't you let us take you?
... Good evening, Louise.
Well, ain't that the truth...
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
No.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Move out? I don't understand, Thomas.
Yes. I will.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
I said - try again.
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
It's your damn job. It never happened when you were a senator...
Good night.
Sorry, Comrade Ambassador.
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Clearly, yes comrade.
Very good, Your Excellency.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
He's an advisor and close personal friend of Rand's! For Christ sakes, they have volumes of data on Benjamin!
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
No, sir.
I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman.
Thank you, Colonel.
Yes, I did.
That's too big a risk, I can't take the chance.
Malkovich!
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
I was worried.
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
Life is confusing, isn't it?
It'll never happen, fuckface.
You fell in love with her first.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
I love you so much.
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
I know. I'm sorry...
Pardon?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
No. I understand perfectly.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
I just wanted to say “hi.”  Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
The usual, Barry.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Sure. It'd be fun.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
My God.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
It's an interesting story, Wendy. Many years ago in the late 1800's, James Mertin, an Irish ship captain looking to invest in the future of our great country, came to this town and decided to erect an office building.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
It is better to light one candle than curse the darkness. I learned that from you.
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Can I be anyone I want?
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Says who?
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
But of course.
Count me in.
Oh, be still my heart.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.
Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.
Great then.
Who's calling?
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Lotte called me.
I'm getting better all the time.
No... damn... you...  Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
You've got to be kidding.
Folks come. Folks go.
Here, let me carry that.
This Saturday - you coming to Call or what?
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
No, Stamp. I ain't.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
You're weren't nice to me..you didn't smile at me..
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
What you want'em for?
I miss her.
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Oh I been out.
I know Denver.
Better ask Paul D.
The church!
I don't know him that well.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
What's any of that got to do with Paul D.?
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You planning to do anything about it?
Never found out.
I did. Down to the cent.$900. Always wondered though what Mrs. Garner got for my brother Paul F. Must of been more than nine hundred dollars cause she use that money for Sweet Home for almost two years. But then they hung my other brother Paul A. up on a tree so I guess he wasn't worth the same..I wonder what was Baby Suggs worth? And Halle? I wasn't surprised when I found out they tracked down Sethe all the way to Cincinatti. Her price must have been higher than all of us - her being property that reproduced itself without cost. A breeder.
She was only-
Who is she? Where she come from?
He looks like a fuckin' loser.
It's the LeBaron.
He suspects that the culprits might be the very people who, uh, soiled your rug, and you're in a unique position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm that suspicion.
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw shit.  We got a nice quiet beach community here, and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.  So let me make something plain.  I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk- off name, I don't like your jerk-off face, I don't like your jerk- off behavior, and I don't like you, jerk- off --do I make myself clear?
The Gundersons.
Come and get it.
ANTI-SEMITE!
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly priced receptacle.
My rug.
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean look at it.  Young trophy wife. Marries a guy for money but figures he isn't giving her enough.  She owes money all over town--
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Were you listening to the Dude's story?
Huh?
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
I'm shomer shabbas.
Come on, Donny, they were threatening castration!
I'm not really, uh.
Uh-huh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Nancy's pretty good.
No, they--
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
I see.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered if I'd see you again.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
But she hasn't run off, she's been--
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
--your rug, yes, well with that money you can buy any number of rugs that don't have sentimental value for me. And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a good man, and thorough.
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
So Dieter has the money?
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Uh-huh.
What do you do for fun?
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid. Real fucking brat.
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
Well...no, of course not--
Yeah man, it really tied the room together--
No, but--
Yeah, but--
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, of course--
You mean--beyond pacifism?
Just, just take it easy, Walter.
What if it's during a game?
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Huh?
Whose toe was it, Walter?
The nail polish, Walter.
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me a very secure feeling.
Huh?
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev shabbas.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
It's just part of your whole sick Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her fucking dog.  Going to her fucking synagogue.  You're living in the fucking past.
Call the medics, Dude.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
Are you employed, sir?
I don't know, sir.
WHAT?!
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
Walter!
I said out.  Now.
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of you!
Stay away from me!  You bullies! You and these women!  You won't leave a man his fucking balls!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
They tell bedtime stories about you. Blade the big, bad boogie-man.  Frankly, I'm disappointed.  That you were willing to come along so easily, I mean.  Without any assurances.
I haven't forgotten.
We need it.  Sensations are addictive and pain cuts the deepest.  Tattoos, piercings, tribal scarring -- because we regenerate, none of it's permanent.  So we have to take it to the next level. To remind us we're alive.
Save it.  I don't want to hear your words.  Let's do this NOW!!!
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I don't understand.
Thought you were dead.
Seems like there's a lot of that going around these days.
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Revenge.  That's what Nomak wanted all along.  To pay back the people who created him.
Getting your attention, Paco.
Any casualties?
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Us?  What are you talking about?
You little shit.  When did they get to you?
You should've killed her, then.
There are other ways to see. Sit.
You've been here longer than you think.
You're joking --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
For some. Live forever, never get old. The ultimate high.
Owned by vampires. There's one of these in every major city, and just like Domino's, they always deliver.  You telling me you're ready to walk through that door?
He will.
You've been watching too much TV. They've got their claws sunk into everything -- finance, real estate, politics. Probably own half of Downtown.
For your miracle cure?
I know. Take some of my blood.
There's only one alternative to the serum.
You don't understand. I've killed, I've hunted, and I've enjoyed it.
I don't believe that.
You will. Time is on our side. Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Then what is it?
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
Only as a last resort. Preserved blood is inferior. There's no flavor left to it, no life.  Fortunately, I've found a way around that particular obstacle.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
No offense, Whistler, but you're not exactly working with state of the art equipment here. You might have missed something.
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
Then vampirism is a genetic defect, just like Hemolytic anemia?
I just wanna go <u>home</u>.
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Let's talk to your husband--
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
--a six week bun in the oven--
The Witch's voice.
Domini. Domini Von Teer.
What is <u>this</u>?
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
I don't know. Nightmare.
You want me to scooch over next to you?
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
--bullshit!
Then I'm going--
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
Beta Cam's still coming back tomorrow, right?
Sometimes.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
I don't know yet.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
Fucking owl!
--Domini!
--a Wiccan--
--turn the goddamn camera off!
This isn't about us.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
A Cyber Entrepreneurialship.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
Guy who killed all the kids in the '40s.
Not planning on sleeping at all.
No. I don't think so.
That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
Get some more beer.
That they'll start touching us inside our heads.
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Whatever.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
Okay. Hypothetically.
Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
She's far from "fine."
--fuck Anna!
There are <u>other</u> explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
What happened to my Dad??
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
Any time. But you don't have to worry about a thing for a while. Marty went down to Corpus yesterday.
No, I--
See a guy.
...Huh?
Yeah? What happened?
Abby... you all right?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
In the trunk.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
I own the place.
Yeah.
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
Got a job for you.
For the money.
Ya catch any fish?
Ya catch any fish?
Jesus, I don't believe it...
I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder...
You said the usual--
We get a lot of assholes in here, Marty.
What's that?
You look good, Jeffrey. Did you have a nice flight?
Fine. Welcome. Come sit down.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Yeah. I've got it here in this bag. I thought I should bring it to you.
Anything you can tell me?
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
It's blue. blue velvet.
Frank?
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see. I'll get you.
Oh yeah, that's good.
Jeffrey nothing.
No way.
See my breasts?  . See?
Do you know?
No. What is happening?
Don't say that.
No. I should go.
Frank is coming?
Whatiya mean?
Yes.
What if I told Frank that you opened me?
Does that scare you?
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
Who, Dorothy?
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Am I bothering you?
I don't know. like I said, she's not my father's case.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
You've got a point there.
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
I owe you. since I goofed up this one.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
I. I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you. okay?
. Actually. I've been in twice.
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
Jeffrey?. Why?
You didn't tell him about me?
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
Where to?
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
Are you feeling okay?
This is it.
Well. Okay.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Yeah. okay.
Nice of you to offer, Jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I'm sure Sandy will be back soon.
Um-hmm.
What?
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Que queres decir.  Que es lo que el va hacer?  Pues, no va hacer nada.
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Derek!
I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.
It's garbage.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no chance of parole.  Even if they cut my sentence in half I'll be seventy-three years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I don't know if the parole board, the judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself can get me out of here.  I have a really bad record, I'm not sure what's going to happen.
What?  Yeah, sure.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Good night.
George, are we gonna do this or not?
What's the matter?  We're moving three hundred fucking kilos and we're making dogshit.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
I don't give a shit.  Close enough.
You fucked me, Diego.
Mexico.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Look at this credenza.  If you don't mind me asking, how much is something like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.
It's beautiful.
And Diego?
Yeah.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
Not mad.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Good.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
But this is...
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
No, never.  Don't even think about that, it's impossible.  I love your mother. And you are my heart.  Could I live without my heart?  Could I?
You swear?
You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
There's schools in California.
That's right.  Three o'clock.  Thursday. At your mother's.  You and me.  It's a date.
It's alright, Dad.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
We'll do that tomorrow, okay?  It's lockdown time.
Yes, I do.
All of it.  As much as you've got.  A couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back in a week with a plane.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
Stoned?
So, we need to get to the source.
That was it.  Seeing Dulli after fourteen years sealed the deal for me. The rest was just details.  My end was roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina and I could have a good life for five hundred grand.  Start over somewhere. One final score.  That's all I needed.
Are we good?  Yeah, we're good.  We're beautiful.  We're perfect.  This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit.  Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
No, immediately. The people are demoralized. Leave this to me ...
Let's try ...
No, and neither were my men.
Why?
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Yes, a name for the operation.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
What did he say about Miss Lawson?
What'd he die of?
The official cause?
Any prints on the nasal spray?
You're bluffing.  John, it's me, remember?  I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his death?
Why not?
She didn't.  She just left.
If you knew it was bad for you why did you do it?
No.
No.  No, I don't.
Oriental medicine.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Where did you meet him?
He used to call me -- tell me that I couldn't just walk out on him.  He said that if I didn't come back he'd make my life miserable.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
He video taped you.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
I don't know.
Because he called me.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
It's not my taste.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Is Mom yelling at you too?
-- But it's Sunday.
That's it, Mr. Dulaney.  Take a seat.
Are you able to back up this allegation -- or are you fishing?
This is not relaxing.
Some example you set.
Attractive.  Bright.  Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
I found out who Lucy Delaney is.  Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Don't talk about what you don't know. Besides, she's too young for "the changes."
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story!  Whereabouts in Italy?
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute...  Here it is.
I feel so embarrassed.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
Francesca?
What?
Francesca?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Woman friends, too?
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No. I was just... No.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
How about if I set the table?
How about Bari?
Have you ever been to that station?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Nobody's asking you to.
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
Sure.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
What happened?
Yes, they are.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Look around, this place is a dump!  Naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.
Some flies?  I think this qualifies as way more than "some."
"This is the story of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stones/Gold plated deuce, like the King of Siam/Got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." There's the switchblade and there's the diamond.  Don't know where the deuce is parked.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
But that's your old hood, Pops.
What it will be.
Where we'll always be...
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
I don't need to hear the deal.  I don't need any partners.  I don't need new product.  And I sure as hell don't need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
Since we was just grasshoppers...
Aren't you gonna do something about it?
Girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
How do you know?
Or the living fall in.  Who knows.
You got the shit?
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Dad?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
Maybe so.  Maybe so.  But that ain't why I came to see you.  You sold the building.
Don't shit a shitter.  Our building. What did you call it?  His 'tomb'?  We had an agreement.  You were supposed to sit on it.  Not sell it --
Well, somebody bought it.  That's what I heard.
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Now you.
Not that I remember.
Why don't y'all check out the rest?  I'm going downstairs and see if I can get the furnace fired up.  Warm this place up, you'll see.  It has serious potential.
I am the future.  I am all colors.  All races.  All creeds.  I am the melting pot.  I am the tossed salad.  I am post racial.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
No shit.  Bianchinni hired you?  You know he's a good friend of mine. |Family, really.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
But it could be anywhere.
I need you ...
We're going to need some time.
Not until he has the money!
They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit.
Where's the fucking money?
Five.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
Me?  Why?
Why'd you move all the furniture around?
Where in the hell is he?
Oh yeah.  Violet!
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Yeah, come on in.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
A beer?
Basically.
The redistribution of wealth?
I'm already in your bed.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
I don't understand - ?
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
He was in love with you, right?
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
You think I'm lying?
Johnnie?
That's his brother.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
What did Gino drink?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Fine.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
What if he doesn't run?
How'd it go?
Pop?
Caesar, come here.  Sit.  We talk now.  You too, Johnnie.
Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
Yes.
You'd want to make that go away. You'd want to remind them that Treadstone is a training organization.  That it's all theoretical.  You'd want to sign off on that.
...which one are you?...
So it's time to go home.
Right.
Excuse me?
I hadn't heard.

Oh, Jesus... 
I've got a situation here and --
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Wait up --  -- just wait up --
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to Paris?
That's what I'm saying.
-- you could put it together --
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
Why do I? -- I come in here -- instinctively -- first thing I do -- I'm looking for the exit -- I'm catching the sightlines -- I know I can't sit with my back to the door --
Thanks for the ride.
How could I forget about you?  You're the only person I know.
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You knew he was coming.
I don't trust anybody and I trusted you!
But the police --
-- forget it --
What?
xxxxxx
I said, someone came last night --  Look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
So get the hell out of here.
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
That old beast?  Miss his breakfast? Not a chance.  It's always something, right?
That's the only angle.
I tried.
All of them?
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with God knows what, he's in the building and I don't know where! --
I don't remember Zurich.
I haven't got an emergency. Get out of here.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
You must save the day.
Oh ...  Thank you very much, mother, but actually -
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
Her name is Jill.
Well ... well, I ...
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
SAM! What a surprise!
Yes, thanks.
Kindness? What's the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Er ... alright. For Christ's sake don't lose it. Here, you'd better sign for it.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
Where do I get it stamped?
If you say so.
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
No.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
What?
Let go! We've got to stop!
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
Expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of Buttle, Archibald, shoe repair operative, but Security has invoiced Admin for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer
But if they did promote you
You've been promoted.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
Ah.  Would you mind if I borrowed your computer console?
Yes.
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
I want to talk to him.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
Shirley and I come here regularly. I love romantic lingerie.
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
My I.D. cards.
No need, sir
Central Services.
Have you got one or haven't you?
It's a 27B/6, what did you think it was?
What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Ha!!
What do they want you or?
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
I'll fire you tomorrow. Hell, better than that, I'll forward you some sick time. A week, two weeks off-- how about that?
No, no, that's impossible.
She say she in great pain.
Two years. Ever since we left island.
No!
Boy can't shoot for shit, either. Goddamn that's hot.
I'm not your baby, Young, I'm not your mother either. You're going to a cardiac arrest, Avenue C and Ninth, northeast corner. It's a club. Take the side entrance.
Ten-four, hon.
Ten-four.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Yeah?
Oh man, Bucky.
You never know.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
You look so different.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Okay.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
Come on up.
We're all whores, Frank. You know what I'm talking about, the way she looked at me.
What's that, Frank?
I'll drink to that.
You can't leave me now.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
Our mission is coffee, Tom. A shot of the bull, Puerto Rican espresso.
I haven't had a chance to see him yet. I'm going to take care of sleeping beauty.
What do you want to break?
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Frank!
You're crazy.
No shit.
What?
You really think so?
You sure?
Nice, Jane.
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Fifty, right?
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
Sit on it!  <u>Now</u> look.
I'll put her on.
London.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
Hold it down, okay?
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Yes.
Eventually rising to...
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
Sure.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
They're not that dumb, after all.
Okay, great -- good luck.
Then what was good about it?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
No.  You know that I'm not.
Your hair's a little funny.
I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
Wipe me out?
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
No.
Oh, that's nice...  We'll need some new lines.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Right there, Bobbie.
How do I get out of here?
Yes.  That's right.
One's enough.
Okay.  At least let me show my appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Okay.
Anchor?
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
I could use somebody to talk to on a day like this.  Sorry. Go ahead.
I'll just have to try harder.  I don't know.  I will.  I will.  I will.  I will.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Yes, sure.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau.  So I'll probably see you at work.  Sorry.
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
Okay.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
That's not it.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
How can you say that to me?
You fucking...
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
A picnic?
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
I decided to make a female figure after all!  I want you to pose for it.
Uh-huh.
I already told you I'm not.
What!
A thing I made.
Oh yeah?
Well...w-what kind of people do you like, Carla?
Of course I do!
You just can't be sorry! I wanna - I wanna marry you!
Why not?!
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
It was.
Nothing...nothing at all.
Why not?
I do the research.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Dead Cat?
I didn't mean to.
I don't have another cat!
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Excuse me I have to make a call...
Listen to me, listen to me...I've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  This newcomer Walter Paisley has it, whatever it is, the X factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and I want that cat in my hands.  Are you listening to me?
Uh, sure.
C-connection?
Telling you what?
Alaska!  What the heck's wrong with it!
Yes, get rid of them...
Here here!
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
Cheer up.  You may still.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Absolutely.  I see now the error of my mistake.
Do people ever call you 'Buffy the Buffalo?'  I'm just wondering.
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
You think?  Split?
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Down there.
What's playing there?
Don't tread on the earth?
What's Bobby gonna say?
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I think you've forgotten something.
I'll back that up.
You sure?
Come again?
I'm going to the senior dance.
It's not a mixer.  It's the senior dance.  And it's important.  You wouldn't understand.
I'm glad you came.
Yeah, you look like you're having a swell time.
I don't actually think Jeffrey's gonna notice.
I really can't.  Besides, it's pretty interesting.
Why don't we see a movie?
Cafe Blase.
Kimberly, it's a dance.  It's a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that I see every stupid day.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm sorry.  That was impressive. The...  tumbling.
To stop the killing.  To stop the vampires.
Cramps?
It's true.
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Who we gonna beat?
Oh.  I thought... you lead me --
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
Toasty.  Were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
Fine.
You are such a wet.
Don't start with me again.
Aren't I, like the chosen one?  The one and only?  The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me?  Like, ever?
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
Another distraction.  It's not right.
You're learning.  Slowly, incredibly slowly, but you're learning.
That's the plan.
Cassandra, you gotta come, too.
No.  It was mondo bizarro.
Swear to God.
I'm just a girl.
Oh, baby!
But --
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
What is she...
I'm sorry.  I'm Pike.  This is Benny.
Hey, wait a minute...
You want some punch?
Oh, please.
Okay.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
God, I never thought of that.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
I think you're real cute.
it's okay..
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
G'night.
You're pulling your hips out.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
He won't make love to me anymore.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
Did you call me a cocksucker?
Beg me!
He did know.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
You're the boss.
Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
No.
No.
You too...Meat.
Crash, shut the door.
Take the first shot at me.
Throw it.  C'mon, right in the chest.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
...and one helluva guy.
I'm Nuke LaLoosh.  With the Bulls.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
What are you talking about?
Was I at that dinner? Just tell me -
On behalf of the Teamsters' Pension Fund, it is my pleasure to present to you . . .
...this check for $62,700,000 for the new Tangiers.
It's a tough proposition, Andy. You, you know, if I did it, I'd have to run it my way.
It's a pity in this...
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Hold on a second.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Eight.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
So, I'm lucky. I'm not allowed to get lucky in this place?
Okay.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
You should say so.
Every time you're on television I get mentioned. That looks bad. That looks bad.
Yeah.
All right.
Okay?
And at the...
Meet me at three.
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Back -
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
I'll be right there.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted.
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
Certainly.  Senator.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you.  Want to take a chance?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Oh...
All this stuff doesn't mean anything. Money, this, doesn't mean anything without trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life.
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay, okay.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
No, you don't.
I'll get your cash. You haven't been straight with me ever since I met you! You never loved me in the first place!  I need eyes in the back of my fuckin' head with you, you fuckin' bitch!
I can back him off.
I'm not -
If she calms down...
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it's a casino. People gotta win sometimes.
Well, I... I never tried.
I didn't give 'em the m-
You gotta go back out there.
Listen... Nicky... we talked about this... and, uh, I explained to you that there was the possibility you might have to take some kind of loss.
Mr Rothstein, why don't we just let her in the house and get a few of her things?  That way she'll get out of here. This is half her house anyway.
Okay.
Now move along.
You've gotta be kidding me! 
Is that what you did?
Nicky, I'm sorry.
Great!
Yeah, we're lookin' for Carmine.
Carmine's gone.
Well, listen, uh... Good luck with the joint, huh? 
But I'm just trying to leave.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
Of course, Remo.
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Ma che cazzo!
Okay, Sammy.
Am I right?
I can see that. Sure.
Mm, you want to steal it? 
He gives a fuck what I do?
All right?
Oh, come on.
You're so nice. 
Yeah.
Exactly.  He hates me.
Come on. Don't be scared.
I need some help. I do. I need some help.  You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
Yeah.
Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh?
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Get lost?
Do you know that?
Okay, then.
Right.
I just talked to him.
Oh, there aren't?  What's that?  Huh? What's that.  There's no more. Thanks, hon.
Why?
Nah. You would've heard somethin'.
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
Angelo and Buster.
And you make it disappear, you know what I mean?
Dominick said they're in the motel?
Take it easy!
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
You sure?
Denying?
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I know, but that's enough.
Then do it the way you want.
Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh?
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
I still have to call my agent--my techno-single just made the hot 100...what's with the phone?
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
I was wondering, if you're not doing anything tonight...Would you like to go to dinner? I know; a tame suggestion considering the wide variety of miniature golf possibilities available to the Oasisburg citizen--but nevertheless, would you?
Oh, it's superb--I mean if you like that fascist nightmare kind of thing...
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Well then, let's agree to disagree...Now how about a picture for my scrapbook?
I hate innocent bystanders.  Whine, whine, whine. Will he settle?
Ooh, I've read about this philly. She's the one who gave that wimp Batman all those migraines up in Gotham...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
You're not strong. You're scared..scared that someone like me will see right through you. Whatever the Cult of Good was, it's not anymore... You don't have to listen to me, just listen to you..
I actually got some memory back last night.
How much?
Oh, do you turn around every time somebody just shouts at you?
You're scaring me, Selina.  Do it some more.
I'll let you know.
I'm not sad, no, I owe the Captain my life. It's just you think you want to help prevent crime, but you realize that's too complicated. It's a lot more fun to punish crime. Then after a while, you don't care what's a crime and what's not, what you became a Warrior for. You just want the kicks. The rush.
Thanks.
Where do you think you're going?
This is one way.
You gotta just look the other way.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
Bear right till the fire road ends.  It's not far.
I'm the one they'd be looking for.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Bullshit.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Satisfied, Wiseass?
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
And what're you whispering for?
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
One of them <u>is</u> a cop.
Don't move around.  You don't want to puncture a lung.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
Hey drop it, okay?
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
I can hear you again, clearly.
I'm trying to.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
Yes -- I think so.  Another crossed line?
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Put the man back on.
Yes.
Because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  Probably all the wrong ones.
L.A.P.D.
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
We might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  Ever see that Tarantino movie -- where Travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
The one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
A typical fuck-up.
What's Nels' number?
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
Think you could do a picture of me?
I need a break.  I've been on a marathon run ever since I had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
How about "later?"
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
Pull over!  Pull over someplace.
Who is this?
Tell the lady to relax.  Tell her I can't wait to meet her in person.
Just relax.
Talk to the man.
Negative.
Soon as Mrs. Oberfeld is in my car I'll toss out your first third. Then I'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
It's in your interest, Nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an LAPD officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  Tell the man.
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
You couldn't be calling at a worse time, Nels.
Who's this?
I suppose you're in your taxi?
Take the 405 south.
Where do I turn?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
We're gonna get there first.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Let her tell you.
Government business?
She's not a girl, Col --
He gave me a look.
Ask him yourself.
Did I?
Cunt.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Fuck off, Dave.
Scottish?
The accent, I suppose.
Hi. You forgot your bag.
You can't leave me then, can you?
How special?
No.
A real gentleman...
Did he dance with you?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Told you, I'm superstitious.
Apologies, my sweet.
And the fact that you didn't know is basically the fault of yours truly. And even when you were throwing up, I could tell you cared.
Know what, honey?
Please, Jimmy.
Okay. Be a good girl and go inside.
You gonna tell me why?
I'm not sure.
And you wouldn't leave me?
You like me better like this.
Yes.
No.
More what?
Love me.
Anything.
Not if you go.
What's that supposed to mean?
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You're back in the pink, Tommy? How're you keeping?
Horny bastard.
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Leave me alone, Jude.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what happens then?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
It's your decision.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
I'm sure.
Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
I can smell her perfume.
Only joking.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
What is it now?
And even if he doesn't die -- you can't just let me loose.
And you play cricket?.
I'll bear that in mind.
Hurry up, would you?
Shut up, would you?
Doesn't matter where.
Like what?
Oh, yes. We do a tour of duty and we're finished. But you guys are never finished, are you?
I didn't.
But they will. As sure as night follows day. They have to. I want you to find her out. Tell her I was thinking of her.
Stop that talk now --
Faster than cricket?
It was fun while it lasted.
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
The letter? The letter ain't worth nuthin'.
Yes, but --
That's right.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Adam --
I love you, Adam.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Of course there is!
Don't be an idiot!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
I heard you, I heard you.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Aren't they?  Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
But I don't have it.
Because they're still here.
Oh.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
That's not Carson Dyle.
Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
That's the spirit.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Would you like to see my passport?
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Alexander.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
That sounds like their problem.
Maybe.
I'm sorry.
Alex --
What? Assassinate somebody?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Yes.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
And the last one?
Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty.
Why bother him?
No. The police have kindly provided us with a list.
Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
He was a wealthy man?
A letter? May I see it?
In Mr. Dyle's room?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Oh.  Neither do I.  Voilà!
I found it! I found it!
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Good for you.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Instant divorce you mean?
The man and the woman are married --
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
What was what?
How would you like a spanking?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
A quarter of a million dollars.
So they think he left it with you.
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
The man you had the fight with.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
Words can hurt very much.
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
Ça alors! From Charles?
I've never seen him before.
He's allergic to him.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
What's he up to?
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
You do?
is there anything you do?
How much further?
I thought you'd be pleased.
Who is she Daddy?
You know where I can find her?
A bullet to the right cerebellum.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
No, you couldn't.
Ok.
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Then you should go.
You think I should go to the party, Mr. Marliston?
You stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. Like this. Like most people stare at car accidents.
No!
You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.
Want to come in for awhile? Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men, head into a private S&M chat room . . .
Kenny'll want to go with you. Cindy's holding a Q and A session at the bleachers. Come on.
You heard about that?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I did.
No I'm really grounded. When I got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
This party is sick.
That's what he said.
The library. I'll be fine.
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
And the police did nothing?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
His mother's an only child.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.

But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.

INT. DARLENE'S STORE - NIGHT.
...we're gonna seal that tunnel!  I want it air-...
He was Major Andrew Bryn-...
Sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
What's going on, colonel?
...son.
I don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
Have you I.D.'d the bodies?
...-five.
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.

...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...fishin'.
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And what if it does?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
How much longer for the range and power projections?
Forty-seven.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
I didn't sell the boy any...


Heat's murder.
An honest living.
It's why you attract a client like my daughter.
Who's the investigating officer?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
Very.
Are you sleeping with her? Come, come, Mr. Gittes. You don't have to think about that to remember, do you?
You may think you know what you're dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
Yes, his girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
Okay. My secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. Tell me are you worried about that girl, or what Evelyn might do to her?
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Oh they don't?
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Tell her later.
Okay, you got yourself a boat.
Okay.
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Since when?
Looking for someone.
I'd like to talk to him.
No.
This broad hired you, Gittes, not Evelyn Mulwray.
Too late for what?
Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
Give you three minutes.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Let her go. She didn't kill anybody.
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Mr. Gittes...  Don't tell me how I feel.
Did he know?
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
What dam?
What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
Working for the District Attorney.
You can't always tell what's going on there.
...No. Why was it.
There's something black in the green part of your eye.
Where are you going?
Upstairs. Why?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
Yes, Mr. Gittes.
Listen, we can't string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
I was the one who pretended to be Mrs. Mulwray, remember?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
Oh, good.
And Mulwray isn't?
Do you know me?
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Well, tell you what, pal. If Ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
May I ask what this is regarding?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Yeah.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
Mortgage Department, First National Bank.
I'm working for his daughter.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
She ran away?
Cross was looking for her all over the country. Offered rewards, everything. Felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Come in, Alfredo.
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
That's right, Modern Times.
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth...  There is a woman.
No! You mean right at the end?  ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
You were expecting her? Huh?  ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy!  Sit down, sit down...  Did she come?
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder.  Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
And the next time don't go around saying such heresy. You survived the fire at the movie house. But no one can save you from the fire of Hell!
Hi. Why are you running?
We'll talk about that later.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
No...
Thais.
Go on!
I didn't see that.
I might make him nervous.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
I'm calling on people who knew Mr. Kane. I'm calling on you.
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
He made an awful lot of money.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Thank you, Mr Carter.  This is Mr. Leland.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if - 
The story about him and Miss Alexander, Mrs. Kane.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
On the chiffonier.  Here.
No.  But you're close.
You really don't know who I am?
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Invite everybody!  Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents!  Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
Don't go, Susan.
I understand that you have political ambitions.  Unfortunately, you seem incapable of allowing any other opinion but your own -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
Not my wife - not either of them.
A wasted day.
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
I want to be transferred to the new paper.  You've been saying yourself you wish you had somebody to -  That's not what I wanted to talk about.
She was going to leave you anyway -
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
That's the train with all the lights.
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
Kane's last words, aren't they, Jerry?  That was Jerry's angle, wasn't it, Jerry? Did you ever find out what it means, Jerry?
Queer?
How long have you been smoking?
That's your lung. By this time, your lung looks like this.
He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way.
It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it.
Yeah, but not in here.
What can I say? He does weird things to me.
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
I was going to tell you. But then we were getting along so well, I didn't want to mess it up.
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
How like her.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
What?
I just told you.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
You work in a market, all right.
No.
I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
Nobody. It was closed.
I can't say for certain until we get him back to the lab, but my guess is he was masturbating, his heart seized and he died. That's when the girl found him.  Something smells like shoe polish.
Shock trauma. She's going to need years of therapy after this. My question is, How did she come to have sex with the dead man?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean it! He was trying to get me.
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
Oooh! Navy Seals!
Allan Harris.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I think it's safe to say yes.
Blasphemy.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
She's in here?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
That seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.
I'm going to miss the game.
Because you buckled.
I've gotta tell you, my friend: this is one of the ballsiest moves I've ever been privy to. I never would have thought you capable of such blatant disregard of store policy.
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
Look who you're asking here. How're we gonna block off the street?
I'm gonna go to her wake.
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
Exactly, which means I can't close it for another hour so we can both go to a wake.
I swear.
What, your dick?
Listen to you.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
Why should I loan you my car?
If you must.
And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.
Because I'm here.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
I'm not.
Watch the store while I go home and change.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
I'll read the book.
Bunch of savages in this town.  Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You might want to see if she's okay; she's been back there a long time.
I told her that. She said she didn't need any. Why don't you join her, man. Make a little bathroom bam-bam.
Fuck you.
I think four.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
Oh, like your life's any better?
Leave her out of this.
Leave me alone.
...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.
It's hard to swallow.
No, really. What did I do that was so wrong?
I didn't strain. I sighed.
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
I don't know.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
And these aren't my drugs-I just sell them.
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
We were going to start again, I think.
Lasagne.
Um... yeah, but it's for employees only.
I hate this fucking place.
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
Ooh! Can we?!
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
How many what?
We might have; I don't remember. How many?
No; who were the three, besides me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
What do you mean?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Like you said-she snowballed him.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
What is it?
Sure.
What're you talking about?
Usually I just turn the can upside down.
What?
Can I have your name please?
According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
I don't fucking know. What am I, his biographer?  Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Feel that.
Oh, I know. If I had to work here all day, I'd be bloated and out of shape, too.
Because he's out of shape.
Well, how about these two movies? 
No, I wasn't.
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
Yo. I'll see you at that party.  I'll see you there?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
I admit, I can be bought.
You do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Near Freedom Falls.  She went for help.
Not on that leg.
Hi, Gabe.
Is it really four thousand?
Nice and easy...
You're not gonna die.  Grab me with your other hand!
That's a virtue isn't it?
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
When you call me Gabriel, I know I've got trouble.
Working...I'm trying to figure out where to start.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
I don't expect you to understand.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
Where's Hal, what's going on?
I can't.  The radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  But Frank'll be looking for me soon. When he gets here I'll contact everybody from the chopper.
You know me, I'm a night person.
Neither can I.  What do you think they're doing now?
Up ahead.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Next time, date only basketball players.
This rope is sixty years old!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
That's exactly what I want you to do.
We don't have time to argue about it!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Forget it!  I refuse!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
How far?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Sue me.
Kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  When you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  Go figure.  Move on Tucker, time is short.
Tucker and Walker.
The monitor! I never ask twice.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
Good morning, Walt.
Richard Travers.
I haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, Walt.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.
Won't you join me, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?
Help me, sir?
Help you.
No, no my boy. No trouble at all. Alex slowly sits.
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out of here the same way as you came in. Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table beside him.
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, isn't it, Alex boy?
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E... He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
Aye.
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Crime?
Yes sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Do you wear any false teeth or false limbs?
Right. The mothballs, Mister.
Lice?
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
How're you feeling this morning?
You mean like going to the pictures?
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Fine. Fine.
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.
Yes?
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up your arse. Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww... He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.
I'm sure it won't be long now.
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. Beethoven just wrote music.
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.
Father, I have tried, have I not?
I've done my best, have I not?
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence commuted to the Ludovico treatment. Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers. Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
Big, big money.
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.
Four in this block, sir.
Thank you.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
What?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
Like what?
Not in a cab...  I mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
It's simple.  What was your pal Louis' first musical instrument?
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
What?  What did you say?
Federal?
Very generous.
By the way.  Daniel said he was sorry.
Months now.  He's been feeding me information on Dmitri.
Pick me up in five minutes.
Max never had many friends.  So much with the piano.  Always keeping to himself, it's unhealthy...
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
By worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  So I can watch them wilt?
Tell it to Max.  Tell him he's an asshole.
Who is this?
What are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
Nothin'!  Aside from Max's mother driving me crazy, I'm dancin' on a rainbow!  Get him on the line, please.
I give a shit whose fault it was, you're payin'!
Oh.  Sorry.
An apology.
I see your point.
People are more relaxed.  Less stress, less traffic, better tips.
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
You should start a union.
Last thing I need is a reason to keep hacking.  This job's a fill-in.
Two, two-fifty.
You always stutter?
I'm cool.
The trunk?
I tried it.
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
I Ching?  You threw a man out a window!
How can you kill him like that?
Rwanda-Burundi.  Central Africa.
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
Friend of mine told me about this great place in South Central.  Says it's like the birthplace of West Coast bebop.  Bird.  Dexter Gordon. Thelonious Monk.  Chet Baker.  I'll buy you a drink.  Expand your horizons...
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm done.  Find another cab.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
She's in the hospital.
Yeah?  What happened?
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
What do <u>you</u> call it?  Ten years doesn't sound temporary to me.  I should have known it was bullshit, you're too good at what you do.
Makes two of us.
You do impress me, Max.  That you do.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
And you believe me...?
That's the reason?
Then what are you?
None of your business.
...pie in the sky?  "Someday my dream'll come..."  But one night you'll wake up and realize suddenly you're old.  It hasn't happened.  It never will.  Life just flipped on you.  Tomorrow became yesterday.  Then you'll bullshit yourself it was never gonna happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a Barcalounger with daytime TV for the rest of your life...  Don't talk to me about murder.  You're <u>do-in</u>' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. Clocking in and out everyday...
Aren't you listening, man?  Love gives you wings.
I, uh, I have some problems.
Drop me off here!
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
Switch the charts.
What is?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
Uh uh, don't want <u>them</u> to see me.
Do they have a secret handshake?
You're certifiable.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Cold War's over, Jerry.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
At a horse show.
Love at first sight?
You do?
What about you?
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
Whatever.
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
I don't believe you.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Not today...
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Wait --
You don't understand --
Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
There is no abort procedure -- we don't know how we turned the damn thing on, let alone how to turn it off.
Dr. Arroway, let me first say --
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Really?  Congratulations, by the way.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
What?  Why?
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Ellie --
It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly.  Play ball.  Really. It's good advice.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
1919+21.  Found a glitch in the timing; probably a starquake.
This is how you see the sky?
You want to classify prime numbers?
Because I can't.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
That's my scientist.
Am I artifact or dream?  You might ask that about anything.
Can you show me?
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game.  Do we have a deal?
Poor, tired, spinning girl... How we feasted on her.  And now that we've had our fill and given her a giant dose of the clap... we're pulling out.  That's Paris, where my daughter was born.  Moscow, where gangsters rule the night and I gave up smoking.  So many battles, so many lives... all that sturm, and drang.  As if it never happened.  If it weren't for a few power grids, you wouldn't know we existed.
What are you talking about?  It's over.
What a coincidence.  It happens to be my fetish too.
It's almost there.  The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
What about you?  Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God.  To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something.  But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real.  Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Did you love him?
I don't think so.
You're willing to die for this.
And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?
How do you mean?
The final countdown.
Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
For managing the truth.  But the truth won't be managed, sir.  It stops being the truth the moment you try.
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
What are you doin' here?
What went wrong?
Gotta go, Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off!
Git to work!
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Fasten your flap! All you Newmeats gonna have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. We got rules here an' in order to learn them, you gotta keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
Borrowin'.
Tramp! Beautiful!
I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
That's what you're gonna have to do.
Fifty's a nice round number.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
You just said he could eat anything.
Oh my. Oh my... Give it back here!
Gettin' up, Carr.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Cuter again.
You can't expect him to learn everything the first day. Hopefully it's taught him a very valuable lesson.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
Stop acting like a silly little fag!
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
When was that?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
I never carried a gun!
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
I will.  I'll call you, Daryll, and talk to you about it after I've read it.  Right now I have a question... Peter Kurten.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
I think this is number three...
Who?
What calls?  I haven't made any calls.
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
How do you know that?
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
I just came from her... here's what you haven't seen.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Why should I trust you?
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
You do that one, I don't want it...
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
If there's a one percent possibil- ity, can you live with yourself when he kills again?
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
Just get out of your vehicle...
He's got Sergeant Halloran in there.  He'll kill her the minute he sees or hears your people...
Over here.
Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
Bunch of Swedish women.  You're too young.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Yessir.  I have reflected on that, sir.  Which explains my gushing deference to you, sir.
Or for some new nutcase to copycat the copycat.
We could use a little help.
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
We're going to review all the evidence carefully before making any statement...
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
I'll listen for you buzzing over.
Have you seen it?
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
Do you find him attractive?
One of my suitors.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
Yes.  They felt like traffic accidents.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Yes.
No, I mean a crash with a history. Camus' Facel Vega, or Nathaniel Nest's station wagon, Grace Kelly's Rover 3500. Fix it just enough to get it rolling. Don't clean it, don't touch anything else.
Patient.
I want to see my mother immediately.
I don't want to hear anymore.
Are you saying I'm through with therapy?
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Oh?
It'll be fine.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Do you want to go see him? I'll take you if you want to go.
Come on.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Tomorrow?
You too, Mom.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
I've already made arrangements.
A deal's a deal.
He's been looking everywhere for weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy after you've been locked away.
Is this really important? Because I don't think it's a problem.
I wasn't hungry.
OK, OK, I'll give it back.
What's my rap?
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
So, it's over?
First off, you'll need to go to Target. And, let's see, what should you buy?
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
I love your apartment.
Yeah?
You've got one hell of a great body.
Thanks.
Coming.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
It's hard to know where to start.
And all the plans we have.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
She's only known the guy a few months.
I really think if you're going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Sure. Of course.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
Yeah.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
Something you did?
Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
I need to tell you something, and I'm not sure how.
Sure, I understand.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Office work?
Or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
I'm going to retire with a shit-load of money. Find me a small country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the States and live the good life.
And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't pretend to be something different than what I am.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
It's Elvis...
Who?
Oui.
Oui.
I don't trust anyone. You don't get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. It's in your nature to steal. I'm just protecting my investment.
I don't have it. That's why Vincent went to Chicago. They arrested him before he could bring it back.
No, I'm good, Angelo.
Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk about buying the Merchant Street warehouse.
Yes.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
I only have your word for that.
Thank you.
I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
Too risky. We don't need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
No one? Then why is Zero here?
And be careful when you get near the top. Zero has a very long one.
What for?
I think he's already figured that out.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Don't bullshit me.
Why haven't you turned us in?
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
How much?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
Hector, don't interrupt me.
Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln are your... associates.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
We've got to get out of here.
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
Get in the car.
Uh huh.
I represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
How?
It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up. He's closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Li Mu Bai is coming to stay the night.
I'm looking for someone.  Jade Fox. I'm a police inspector from Shaan Xi, Gen Su district.  Jade Fox is a master criminal.  I hear she infiltrated the Yus.  She must have come with them when they transferred here.  But with Yu's reputation, I can't just go in and accuse her.
My name is Li Mu Bai.  The Green Destiny is mine.  Jade Fox can't be your master.  Where did you learn that "Xuan Piu" move?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
I'll never live as a thief!
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
Wherever we want.  We'll get rid of anyone in our way.  Even your father.
You wouldn't have understood, even if I had tried to explain.  You know... you've gone as far as you can go.  I hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
Master... I started learning from you in secret when I was 10.  You enchanted me with the world of Giang Hu.  But once I realized I could surpass you, I became so frightened!  Everything fell apart. I had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
Put them down.
But you're just like the characters in the stories.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
Yes.  Did you know I was once engaged to be married?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
Look at the trouble you've caused. Now you know what Giang Hu life is really like.  If you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  You can run from marriage, but not your parents.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
You're tired.  You need rest.  Your horse needs water.  There's a creek up here.
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
I am a man.  And now I've found the brightest star of all.
It's time for me to leave it behind.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Did you see who posted it?
Have you questioned him yet?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
Not a bad idea.  Tonight we'll get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
We must avenge mother!
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
But the sword could be in his compound.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Who ever made that.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these.
Not me.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
I'd like to get in touch with him.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
I need to find him kind of soon, Elly.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
A whole club of pirates, with pirate names...
Of course you can. ANGLE - GRANGE IN THE GALLERY --  in darkness.  The running lights on his night-scoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle which THROWS vague sprays of eerie red and green light.
Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?!
Yes.
I'm already alone.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
I was wondering if you could tell me anything... about a wildcat operative.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
I'll be fine.
You heard me.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
Forever.
No.
You did?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Thank you.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
Because you act like a pig.
It's my house.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Give it up.
What are you doing?
I do.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
I have feelings for you.
But you knew this was important to me.
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
What do you mean?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Does your mother know?
No.
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
I was just kidding.
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
I swear.
You promised to let me kiss you.
No. This is going to be our last session.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Did you do everything I asked you to?
I'm pretty sure she did.
I'll be in touch.
But I can't even see her. She doesn't have her own phone, I don't even know her e-mail address.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Sounds intriguing.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Could you be more desperate to read it?
Okay.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Who are you spying on?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
Exactly the opposite.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
No, tell me.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Excuse me?
P-whipped, p-whipped.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
I accept. Now get out.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
I think you have your answer.
Ronald? That's crazy.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
I did?
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
I'm sure I don't, Alice.  It's something else -- something moody -- something sickly --  She could almost be Irena's child.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
That's right.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Yes, daddy.
I didn't forget.
And who did the voice belong to?
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
But there's no one here, darling.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
I can not tell you.
I shall want you for always.
That one's an elm.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it!  I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy.  I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
It stands so still.
But why?
the ring up to him) What's a mourning ring?
But she's such a nice lady.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
Why hasn't he got a head?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Yes, yes -
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Go on -- out with you.
I like to see her happy.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
I don't believe in PMS. Women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Anything's better than Mark.
Can't you get contacts?
I kind of asked him to. We were, you know... he got a little carried away...
Maybe they have to pee.
I don't see anything. Maybe just a little.
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
He wasn't wearing a ring. But you don't want to date a cop Frida. They're so blue collar.
I look like fuckin' Chewbacca.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
I could smell another woman on him.
You're such a good friend.
Maybe you should go out with him. If you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
Check out what I found.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
What choice do we have?
No. I won't let you do that.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Sorry -- I shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. Are you sure you're going to be okay?
I'm not really hungry after all.
No. Really, I'm... I don't feel well. I've got terrible PMS.
I really gotta pee.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
It's the truth. If you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
Come on, I'm your biggest supporter.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Coffee and...
Your desk.
No?
So what book did you buy?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out and she was lonely...
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I don't think you'll hurt me.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
Thanks.
You say you killed a man and don't remember it. Couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? It's sexual. Why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
You can't believe this bullshit.
Hell no, I'm not into that shit. The sight of blood makes me sick.
I checked all the zoos. No missing animals. You think a pitbull?
Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than Madonna in Penthouse.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
We only live a few blocks apart.
I see...
The Chief-Inspector thought you might need a hand.
<u>Fine</u>?  Look here!
All the important stuff.  Wrap it up for me.
Why are they after you?
Don't know that either.
You seem restless.
No.  I mean...  that isnít necessary.
Not exactly.  She was found in a canal, disembowelled.  Throat cut. Blood drained.  The body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
I don't blame you for getting angry. You are in a frustrating situation. You must be patient though.  Trust me completely.  I'm here to help.
Not that again...
Don't worry about it.
I promise.  I won't.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
`Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Bob...
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him.  And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Like how?
Fine.
Nobody's got clean kids.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up.  Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  The whole thing is under control.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
Don't do this.
Dave -- I'm working.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
Well, it's...  It's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
Oh, yeah... probably...
A teleprompter.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
This is wrong, Alan!
He's not.
Perceptual?
Well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
And these are a gift from the King of To go.
The Fidelity nonsense...
They re not my attack dogs.
Yeah.
`Bleed for your king.'
What's that?
Oh, sure.  Don't worry about it.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
You weren't in the state legislature.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
I don't mind.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
Just wait.
It's nice.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I know.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Come on.
Oh, yes. Quiet. Yes. We must be quiet.
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Tonight?
That's right. 'Bout eight, if that suits. We'll start out in my gymnasium an' progress on from there...to various other forms o' physical therapy.
You'll find the ways, Miss Mary. And when ya do...we'll sail on over to the mainland...or any other damn mainland fer that matter...and start us a recruitin' program. There's millions o' Bees out there jus' waitin' fer' a General ta lead 'em on ta vict'ry!
Curse?
I say it's poetic. Pure calypso, brother. The Devil's Trumpet blowin' the notes o' doom for the Devil's troops. Ha ha ha ha ha...
Any dead whose brains are intact will revive.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
No. You won't be able to do it. He will rise. He will rise and you... you will die.
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
No time for that. I'll take care of them.
Don't come.
Knox?
It will?  How do you figure?
Yeah.
This is it.
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
If I find that there are others, Mr. Dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  Stand up.
They were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  Said they were curious about the school so I invited them to the meeting.
No.
What happened?
You know,
Knox?!
All I'm asking you to do is listen.  "The heavens made a girl named Chris, With hair and skin of gold To touch her would be paradise To kiss her glory untold."
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Just give me one chance.  If you don't like me after tonight, I'll stay away forever.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
A barbaric yawp.
Yawp!
A... A  sweaty-toothed madman.
Mr. Keating, my father is making me quit the play at Henley Hall.  When I think about carpe diem and all that, I feel like I'm in prison!  I mean, I can see his point.  We're not a rich family like Charlie's.  But he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what I want!
Are you kidding?  He'd kill me!
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Yeah, you just do everything they say! You'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as I'm standing here.  And you'll be approving loans till you croak.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
But different.
Beyond the stream.  I think I know.
I don't.
Yes.  But
Jesus Christ, whose side are you on?  I haven't even gotten the part yet.  Can't I enjoy the idea even for a little while?
No, I want you in.  But being in means you gotta do something.  Not just say you're in.
No!  I don't know,  I'll probably never know.  The point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? I can take care of myself just fine.  All right?
No?  What do you mean 'no'?
It is?  Happy Birthday.  You get anything?
Chicken shit.  Where were we?
Yes.
We have to make it to the third deck...
We're going to die here! We're going to die!
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
And she could do a hell of a barbie to boot! Belt up. You'll find all the parts you need up there.
Did you clear this?
Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I'm not a thief.
Then who are you?
He's with them.
You hear that?
With the emphasis on SELF, and in selfish, right?
Yeah you did...
Right... You have a boat.
The "come back" kind.
And what if I run into one of those things?
I'm flying blind here God damn it!
I know...I know...if the cash is there we don't care...  Finnegan this is as mean a pile of shit as we ever carried...
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Oh yeah...and that my stich job doesn't make you uglier than you already are...this won't hurt a bit...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
What happened to Vivo?! What the hell happened to Vivo?
Yeah.
Good... Pass the beer.
John,we're going huntin'.
We're all going.
They did not!
It's gotta!
It's Nick!
Vince thinks... you know...
I do!!!
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
Tell him, Vince.
Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
You know what Sal's got now?... Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and... that's it.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
You mean...?
Linda, yeah.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Yeah?
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Sal's alive???
Oh, Jesus.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Linda, Linda...!
Okay.
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Playing.
No. No, no.
Right here.
Yeah.
Listen, asshole, it's up to us!
What else?
I'm doing that too.
You're right... Okay, you're right.
Forget Sal... Listen to me -- forget Sal! I've been working on Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a dream and he won't come out. LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go for you. You hear me? For you!
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
More bullets in the gun?
Watch it, shithead!
No!!!?
There's Albert!  Hey, Albert!!!
Great. That's great.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
What?
Hey, Nick. How can you need me?
Yeah.
Yeah!
It's all right. Hey, it's all right. We'll be right here, right with you.
Down.
Up.
This monster escaped from Cryo- Prison this morning.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Who are you?  What the fuck do you want?
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
We have an antidote that'll retard the aging process.
You stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  I was iced.  What better way to keep me from talking.  Stop me if I'm wrong.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
Yes.
Got it.  Ejection seat?
Thanks.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
You want to be a good detective?
No thank you, sir.  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
You be careful.
And you should be with your family.
It's stuck, but thanks for the offer.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
Of course I will.
You're lying.
You know that you're in my house.
Anybody can see that.
Too bad it didn't happen to Miser Stevens.
-- in gold.
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
Not at all, lad -- not at all.  For a good game of horseshoes I would always sacrifice fame and acclaim.
That's just fine, Neighbor Stone -- but -- I have to be pretty careful of my seats of honor -- where I sit, I mean. You see, the whole country sort of has its eye on me, Jabez -- anybody in public life has that difficulty -- even you, Jabez. They watch us carefully, our neighbors and our enemies, and they see much more than we think they do -- and understand much more. My friends all like to think that I've got the good of mankind always at heart, and I've got to make sure that those I deal with have the good of mankind always at heart, too. Do you know what I'm talking about, Jabez?
No -- you haven't time -- You haven't time for your mother, or your wife, or your child.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ...  It's a lovely calf.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
I'd love to.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Don't take cold, Jabez.  Come -- it's warm in here.
Jabez --
I'll get it, Jabez.
What in sugar hill's the matter with him?
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
All right, Jabez ...
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
I can't help it. I mean it, I tell you. I've had more than my share. Nothing ever goes right for me -- nothing!
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Me -- a son.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
It don't matter!
What's that you say, Son?
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
It's all right, Sheriff.
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Mary -- Jabez --
Coming, Ma.
Me? Why, look here, Mary Stone -- I'm worried about you, that's all.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Scratch will do for the evening. May I -- join you?
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
My money? Why, Mister Stevens? What a quaint idea. Come over to the door. I want to speak to you privately. Stop throwing away that money. We mustn't let people see any softness in you, Mister Stevens.... People take advantage of softness, you know. Come out of there -- I'll give you an extension if you'll forget this stupid repentance idea.
Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns.  I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk?
What does he want?
See to Heinrich...  Now...you can break the code key...?
He had the detonators!  Theo?  Theo!
Only if New Jersey counts.
I told you...
Thirty minutes to break the code... Two hours for the five mechanicals. The seventh lock...that's out of my hands.
Then don't waste time talking to me.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
This is a Japanese company, you know? They figure a married woman, she's on the way out the door...
I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune.  Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray.
Ask the FBI.  They've got the terrorist playbook and they're running it, step by step.
Bullshit.
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Then who the hell have you been talking too?
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself!
No.  I never smile any more.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Heidi, I'm dying.
Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter.
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close.
How are you doing?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Well.... huh ...
Well...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
God, Algeria!  Do you know there's a bunch of... they walk around there... God!  People walk around with masks and things on their heads.  They're a bunch of crazy people there.
He ain't going out.  And if I go out he's just gonna kill the people. There's a lot of lives that I'm responsible for... that's all.  So, I can't do anything.  I got myself into this mess and I'll get myself out of it... the best way I know how!  One of the ways is not giving up.  I'm telling ya!
These guys that got me down here, you know, huh... they think that I'm part of this whole thing.  They think I'm part of the plot to rob the bank!
Oh no!
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
... armed robbery ...
Calm down... look at this, look at him...!
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Yeah ...
It can't happen again ... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can ...
Cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
My side, shit!
Gimme the keys to get outta here!
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
I'm sorry.
You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training ... I used to have a boss ... Mr. Don Frio ... he wore a toupee ... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job ...
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Howard!
Yeah.
What are you crying for?  Jesus Christ.  It's not your fault there's no money...
I want him to think that.
What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
They gotta stop sayin' that.
He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal.  What's wrong with him?
No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny.
Bullshit!
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready?
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Sonny - Here's your document.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
She doesn't have anything to do with it!  You understand that? Mother?  This is me!
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
No!
Robbing a bank.

Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
What was you saying?
Hold your tongue.  You don't have that much love.
Maybe you shouldn't.  Don't get happy.  This changes nothing between you and me.  You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
We're still standing.
Don't worry 'bout me.  I always get paid.
What are you so worked up about?
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...

You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
Fuck dat.  The time is fuckin' now. Y'know I'm sorry 'bout Sal's Famous Pizzeria, but I gotta live, too. I gotta get paid.
Do we now?
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up.  Do you love me?
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Trust me.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
People are free to do what they wanna do.
Remember what I said.

Good, make sure he don't jerk around.
Yeah, I think.
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
Excuse me.
Yeah. How'd you know?
I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
That's because Ms. Heller doesn't want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
Yeah...
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
No, I'm fine thanks.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I'm just not ready.
Maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
Probably because we've never met.
No no no no no.

Oh, is this your special place?
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.

If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
Oh Harry's doing just fine, he's just about to open up.
Oh, go on.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
Uh-oh. Harry?
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
Yes, it's the big potato. Just have a look at this.
What?
Everything?
They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well, my lord.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
We are alone...
Would you really have drawn my blood?
My Lord?
It could only be one thing....  It's a crysknife.
Where are we do you think?
Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told you how to do that?
Greater than treasure, Usul.  We have thousands of such caches.  Only a few of us know them all.  When we have enough... we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!...
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
They tried and died....  Jessica!
No.  I never drink -- wine.
Because I'm planning on dying soon.
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character!  Bunny, Bela's here.  Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  <u>I need transvestites</u>!
Uh, a cop.  NO!  You play the father. He's <u>angry</u>!  He doesn't like seeing his son -- no -- he doesn't like seeing his <u>daughter</u> behave this way!
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Ah!  This is very exciting.
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
But maybe not.
I was thinking about killing myself.
I'm obsolete.  I have nothing to live for.  Tonight, I should die.  And you should come with me.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Uh... you're a very important and respected man.  You're leaving your house... and you're in a hurry to a big social event.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
No problem.  I know it by heart...
Yes!  I've dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I've got to take action.  GOODBYE, PENIS!
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
And who may you be?
H-how'd you know?!
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Will he be okay?
I know... But sometimes I get scared this is as good as it's gonna get...
I thought he was dead.
Say it a little louder.  I don't think Bela heard you in his trailer.
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
But Ed, we're not even married.  And you don't have a job.
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
The other sixty-thousand you said you'd give me.
Oh!  Our church has the money for one film.  We just don't have it for all twelve...
Yeah, well we've GOT a big star! Bela Lugosi!!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Bela, he talk.  Loretta, she talk. But Tor, he no talk.
Yes?
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
It is when it works.  You know the one film of mine I can stand to watch?  "Kane."  The studio hated it... but they didn't get to touch a frame.  Ed, visions are worth fighting for. Why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
Fuck no!  But there's a poster.
Well, Mr. Weiss, I'm your guy.  I work fast, and I'm a deal: I write AND direct.  And I'm good.  I just did a play in Hollywood, and Victor Crowley praised its realism.
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
So change the poster.  Trust me, you'll be better off.  This is a story that's gonna <u>grab</u> people.  It's about this guy.  He's crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  Should he tell her? Should he not tell her?  He's torn. George, this is DRAMA.
You can't talk that way about my movie.
Oh.  My condolences.
Oh, hi.
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Didn't you just make one called "Bride Of The Atom"?
You know, to make the legs move --
I do.
Doesn't this strike you as a bit morbid?
NOOOOO!!!
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Wow.
What if--you're vomiting?
Do they show it?
Anything good?
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
What do you mean "they're gonna have him die?"
You know what would be great?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Uh-huh?
Ed, do you want my advice?
No.  The deceased is ... Henry Pekurny.
You said that.
Right, right...
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Hank! All of a sudden. Because now you're famous and he can get something from you. I don't wan you to become a victim like Marcia.  Not that you're a victim, honey. You're not. Life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
Oh God. What hospital?
St. Joseph's.
Who?
Oh my god! On TV!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Not too good. That's why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you're in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. Ed, I urge you to reconsider. I urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. Play fair with them, Ed.
Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
I batted!
Welcome to work, Ed.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Really? You see, to me, you shouldn't have any trouble with men. There should be, like, a line behind you.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
Can't we just --
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
Twenty-nine.
Come on, let's go.
Somewhere.
What did you do to your hair?
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I'm not stitching Nikes in Panama! ... Bedwetter!
What?
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
Screw off.
No. What happened?
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
Cassie...
Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Hi, Shari.
No problema.  You want a picture?
No. Am I supposed to?
It's Ed.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
Oh, man! So...
We have to stop meeting like this.
pierde.
You guys have fun?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Larry, we're not electing the fucking Pope here. Just tell me who won.
You know what they say about the early bird.
Here they are.
Sure
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Calm down, Tracy.  Just calm down.
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious.  I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
well, I don't know.  It could have been anybody.  There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard.  You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs.  Or Doug Schenken - what about him?  Or what about Tammy Metzier?  Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
This isn't the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  I think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  You're very young, Tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you'll understand.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
My house.
You will.
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
More this way.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
You sure?
Oh.
Still clear?
Easy, tiger.  Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
And 290 "disregards," right?
Larry, you just take it easy
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I know.
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Huh?  Oh, hi, Tracy
It's not what you think.
Of course I am.  What kind of question is that?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Miss Bracken, don't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
You fuck for money.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective...
How'd you get to know so much about him?
So tell me about it.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
Look at a picture for me.
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
You don't know what the word means, you dumb bastard.
Dudley.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Richard Stensland.
We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve.  This is where Lynn Bracken's booze bills go.
Dick Stensland.  Had to be dumb panic.  If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
More or less.
Just getting my facts straight. Twenty-two makes it a gas chamber bounce. You should have pulled this caper a couple of years ago.  Get life, do a little Youth Authority jolt, transfer to Folsom a big man. Orbit on some of that good prison brew, get yourself a sissy --
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
No.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Twelve years ago he worked a vice roust with Dick Stensland.  They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam.  Guy ran hookers. He'd have them photographed with their johns, then double-dip for some blackmail.  Charges got dropped.  Insufficient evidence. You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it.
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Give me a minute, will ya?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
What?
You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl, <u>Lieutenant</u>.
A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White.
Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
She <u>is</u> Lana Turner.
Bud White's been here?
Why not?
On what evidence?
Under the house.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
They want to hold you in Contempt for ethics violations.
Rachel Banks?
You've heard of the National Security Agency?
That's who they are.
I don't know what that means.
I don't know what that means.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Well...there'd be too much disclosure to prosecute me. So they ruined my records and made sure I'd never hold a real job again.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Who?
In the warehouse. They're hiding in a duct on the third floor. When we go back inside, they're gonna kill us. When they notice that we're moving toward the car, they'll come running out of the building.
They shouldn't have come without calling first.
You sure?
Tell me about it.
No he won't.
Same thing?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
Who?
Is Jerry Delsano in?
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Are you sure about this?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
Eight.  Size eight.
<u>Wildlife</u> footage, for God's sake. I don't see how he could've slipped you something that the FBI would be interested in.
About the accident.
Why so edgy, Mr. Dean?
Not that I could see.
No.
I saw a man die.
What do you mean?
The thing is, when I saw him, it seemed like he wanted to tell me...  ...he was upset about something and he said...  Doesn't matter now.  I'm gonna wash up.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
Who did you work with to get the--
How could you let me find out like this?
I know.
My father's put me in touch with an attorney. He'll be--
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
What is it?
Here, you can use this.
Why the hell would I--
I want to talk to a goddam lawyer.
Oh.
It's how he works.
I gotta go.
For the last four years.
How?
This conversation's over.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We believe he did.
Otherwise you may have to what?
Put David on it. He seems anxious to clear my name.
I don't under--
Hi, dad.
Having an adventure. I can't tell you about it right now, but I'll tell you about it soon.
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
No.
The blender?
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
They only took electrical appliances.
He's heard that it's escalated.
Ssh!
I won't <u>make</u> it to the police. They won't let me get there. You go.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Tell me about it.
Are you okay?
No. He said they were doing a credit check. Are you refinancing a loan?
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Because we, and our associates, have paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to shyster lawyers like you, <u>because</u> of shyster lawyers like you, and we'd just as soon sit back and sip a beer while you get ass-banged by as many people as possible.
What the hell does it mean?
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
No sir.
Do you have visual?
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
Federal Express?
For Daniel Zavitz. I just need a signature.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Then let's assume I don't.
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
The Ostrich is a detour.  A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method.  Nothing to do with Zerzura.  To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer.  Haunting the ostrich.
Pardon?
I thought you might paste them into your book.
Oh my God, the others!
No, but I think I do.
Will you please come in?
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
It's a folk song.
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Yes.  Absolutely.
Oh dear.
Still a car.
Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
Right.  And what's your name, sir?
Look, listen to me.  A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  I have been walking for three days!  I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy.  And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
Don't be so bloody naïve.  You know there's a war breaking out.  This arrived this morning.  By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Shut-up!
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
Don't cut me.
Are you Hana?
No.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know.  It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
I liberated it.
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Finally!  So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I can't hide anymore.  I breathe like a dog.  I lose my balance.  Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
We shall miss you.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
Well, she is!
I'm fine.  I got hot.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Thank you.
I'm not laughing at you.  Go on, please.
Why?  Can he lay eggs?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
Never heard of it.
I follow the wires.
It's what I've learned.
He can't even move.
If anything happened to you I'd never forgive myself.
He's from there - edge of Lake Ontario right, Soldier?
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
Why?  Are you German?
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
Why didn't I think of that?
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
So what?
No. Why would I be?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
That's my girl.
Not funny.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
That's because I wanted them to!
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Thank you.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
The Mask.
It's your mistake.
Okay, 80-20--
Hold the record. Alone.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
Transfer.
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
It's no good without the argon gas.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
We're doing it tonight.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Can't be too careful.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
This is big enough.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
This better be worth 1t.
It's too soon.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
You know where my loyalties lie.
Call it an expression of trust.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Oh, Jesus.  Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
There's more than one?
Yes?
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
If you hadn't used profanity --
Bullshit, you don't.
Good.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
I don't get why they'd do that.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Erin --
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
What?  Who?
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
So what are you thinking?
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Uh-huh.
Because.  They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial.  Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Fuck Kurt.
Erin?  What are you --
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin.  The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Yesterday.
Good.
Did he say why?
At the time, I thought, I got six kids, some of 'em want to go to college.  I can't afford to lose my job.  I told myself I was being honorable.  But there's nothing honorable in what I did.  Maybe that's why they picked me for the job. Maybe they knew what kind of man I was.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
I don't know.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
How?
I was serious before, you know.  If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
You're someone to me.  You're someone real special to me.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
Yeah.  We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
What do I look like, Erin?  A library?
I moved payroll onto the computer.  It only knows to process paychecks for employees who log on in the morning and off at night.
Uh-huh?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
But you cannot control it.  This is a dangerous time for you, Luke. You are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Howls.
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Help you I can ... yes ... yes.
I'm not looking for a friend. I'm looking for a Jedi Master.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Not likely!  Where are the speeders?
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The Empire won't look for you out here.  I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
Sit down, and shut up!
Good.  Soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
He'll know when he gets back ... Don't give me that look.  Every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  If I don't pay off Jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... Remotes, Gank killers, and who knows what else.  I've got to get that price off my head while I still have a head.
Forget it.
Don't worry, your holiness, I'll get her started.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
I'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or I'd be worried.
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
Aren't I?  Hang on, sweetheart. We're gonna do some flyin'.
Good.
You don't look angry.
Outside, in the cave.
You're going to attack them?!!!
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
We have no use for your kind.
Luke needs help.  We must go back.
I understand.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
What did you say?!
I've never seen it fail.
That is why you fail.
But how am I to know the good side from the dark?
But tell me why ...
Yes ... I also feel danger ... death.  Something's not right.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
With food?
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  Somebody else was in there with her.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Give it.
Where?
He's... near.
Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Not anymore.
Get me to Cuervo Jones. Get me to the Kingdom. I got one hour.
You want to stay here, while Cuervo Jones rules the world?
That's the deal.
Having second thoughts?
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Call me Snake.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
The name's Plissken.
You're free, Plissken. But if you even so much as break wind on a country road I'll crush you like a bug.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
No way.
I said pull over.
Right. Keep goin' straight. Two blocks down, turn right.
I used to represent the guy who invented it. I swear to God, Snake. No bullshit.
A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
Find Cuervo Jones.
Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
He heard Lady Guenevere's request and he said nothing. That is all.
...Perceval!
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
I will not.
I gave up my castles and my lands!
Lancelot, I will save you... Don't die.
--It is the old wound, that has been opened. I have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. Let my heart do its job, my King, and pump me empty...
Ready my knights for battle; they will ride with their King once more. I have lived through others far too long! Lancelot carried my honor and Guenevere my guilt. My knights have fought my causes. Mordred carries my sins. Now, at last, I will rule.
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
What book is that?
The book without pages. Open before you, all around us. You can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
Love demands it.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
A lovestruck page!
Maybe... maybe...
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
Walls of shining crystals, burning with red fire, furnishings of metals and jewels never seen by man...
To kill and be king, is that all?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
Oh great, anything else?
Dinner at the White House.
Of course I didn't.
Storage.
Sure you won't change your mind?
We still don't know.
Groceries maybe? A package?
No rats. Thanks a lot that's terrific.
Karl!!
What is it? A tranquilizer?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Look doc, I really don't understand how her whole personality could change.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
You show me Regan's double: same face, same voice, same everything. I'd know it wasn't Regan. I'd know in my gut and I'm telling you that that thing upstairs isn't my daughter! And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
No.
What kind of stuff?
Where?
Here I'll show you.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Who's Captain Howdy?
You think?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well what would you like to do? Got any ideas?
Oh I love you.
But you like him.
Oh Regan I love your daddy. I'll always love your daddy. Burke just comes around here a lot because he's lonely, don't got nothin' to do.
I don't know, I just thought.
Damien Karras.
Who's in it?
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
In time.
Ego te abslovo.
Holy water.
Uoy era ohw.
Now momma you have to stay off it, you can't keep go up and down those stairs you have to give it rest.
You are not happy. Tell me what is the matter?
Be unto her o' Lord a fortified tower.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
Amen
What's this about?
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.
No I probably wouldn't.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Are you a relative?
Who is it?
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
So maybe it's time we took a vacation from each other.
Swimming trunks.
What's wrong with them?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
My pleasure.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair.  Come on, we're on.
Count it.
Maybe Thursday.  I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
It was an accident.
Seeing anyone in particular?
What?
No.
That's what we agreed.
Okay?
Get out of here.
It's not gonna hurt you.
She's here.
Yeah.  Something.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Good idea.  To Peggy Lee.
Yeah.
Because I can hear it.
They stopped serving two hours ago.
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
The party's over.
No, you're wrong.  It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
April.
You could've come.
I can't make the tenth.
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
This'll kill 'em.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
I can keep the beat.
Spur of the moment.
What about me?
My watch is broken, too.
Look, miss.  We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
We ran long.
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
Come on.  We don't have much time.
A seven.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Sorry.  It only plays static.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Smells like fish.
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
Forget it.
Born and bred.
We trust you, Lloyd.  You know that.
How come?
Baker.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
Black.  Labrador.
I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
Yes.  I supposed you still have that old phone booth.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
I guess in case one year they're not.
It's okay.  Last one.
Like a baby. You?
In and out.
Who's Nina?
Ed? How many people live here?
Sure.
Huh?
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
There's always another girl.
So ... ?
Hi.
No.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
He's got blood in his eye.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
Ever go to church?
Merry Christmas.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
He's losing his teeth.
... Thanks.
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
Five.  No one knows you're his father.  I thought someone might want to hurt him -- just to hurt you.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
Or reactivated the first one.
What's worse than losing five million bucks?
"Thanks?"  I guess they really did fuck you up.
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
Something good?
So you had a nightmare.
No.
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave?  Okay, go on!  GO!
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
Eve ...
It can't be.  It's impossible.
Not if I kill you first ...
I've never been more certain of anything. Get everyone in position. -- And get the word out -- shoot to kill.
No problem.
What do you know about it?
I'm not going anywhere.
You always say that -- then you leave.
-- Studying.
Why Jack?
I’m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
On a case by case basis...
Kate’s my wife...
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  You’re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Screw the rules.  I’m talking about the choice.
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie.  Please...
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
I've got everything I need.
Basically, it’s my car now.  Get in.
How much time?!
Look Jack I’m late.  I’d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business...  Happy trails.
Get out!
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Are we what, Jack?
Uh huh...
What?
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Because you’ll be here.
Well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
Really.
But I’m gettin’ close, right?
And now...?
That’s a big one for me, too.
It’s like a museum.
I don’t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  We’ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
No, this is the center of the universe.  If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else?  Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
Jack.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Where is he?
Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
Okay, I’ll take them...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Of course I did.
Thanks.  You're not bad yourself...
He's made a few changes.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Reed, I'm not talking about Debbie.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Yeah.  I can tell.  Victor was right.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
Really?  With a name like Von <u>Doom</u>? Never saw <u>that</u> one coming.
I don't care about rocks, I care about <u>you</u>.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
And you can?  Power it up?
Oh, he did.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
That's terrible news...
Cool.  What'd it do to you guys?
You've been working out.
I can go hotter!
Meet me at 4:01, top of the run. That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
Stay right.  Left is trouble.
You gave us <u>names</u>?  What are you, the "face" of the Fantastic Four now?
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
At least it beats living in a lab like somebody's science project.
And that's a <u>good</u> thing?
Sure.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Well, he's welcome to ride shotgun, but we already have a pilot on our payroll.  You remember my brother Johnny...
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
What in the world would give me that idea?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
That would have kinda defeated the purpose.  And Reed...  I'm saying it now.
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Raising the shields.
Just <u>find</u> him.
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
No...
I know that. But what's the maximum?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
Say that again?
They have...  But we've both got the same problem -- lack or control. We can only keep things Miniaturized for exactly sixty minutes. Arter that, everything starts growing back to its original size.
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
Why don't you go on. We'll meet you at the Clearance Desk in a few minutes.
No danger of attack, as long as you don't trigger them off by any injury to the System.
But big enough for us...
But I did. I'm positive!
No, it requires such absolute precision --
I've got a source. All I have to do is tap it.
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
As usual, you want everything your way. Except this time there's more than your damned ego at stake.
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
Well, it seems to me if you reduce a ship to microscopic size -- and the stream remains constant -- we'd take quite a beating.
Well, we better get on with it.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
The Lymphatic System drains off excess fluid from the Tissues. Without it, we'd all swell up like balloons. He reaches the console, begins to take out a new chart.
How long will it take to get from here to the Removal Point?
Go ahead.
That makes two of us.
Could I run a tube through that Wall, without harming Benes?
The Wall's transparent...
What do you mean?
Where's my damn daughter? No Jean, no money!
Is this a fucking joke here?
What's this, sir?
Yeah, well, it depends on the artist. You know, Jose Feliciano, ya got no complaints. Waiter!
What?
Yeah, yeah, Jesus - I'm sayin', we'll stop for pancakes, then we'll get laid. Wuddya think?
No.
Geez. That's more'n I've heard you say all week.
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.
I'm not gonna sit here and debate. I will say this though: what Shep told us didn't make a whole lot of sense.
So why don't you just ask him for the money?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
I'll see you tomorrow.
I sat right here and said I didn't want no TruCoat!
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
You have children?
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
So he says, 'So I get it, so you think I'm some kinda jerk for askin',' only he doesn't use the word jerk.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Yah, got a front movin' in.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Uh-huh.
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
I couldn't really say. He wasn't circumcised.
Yah.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Yah?
Uh-huh.
Uhn.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
...My fee? Wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
Yah.
No, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. Grandad and I, we're - we're makin' sure this gets handled right.
No! We can't let anyone know about this thing! We gotta play ball with these guys - you ask Stan Grossman, he'll tell ya the same thing!
but do you know that for sure without -
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Sir? Right now?
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Well, what do ya mean?
...Yah.
Stan Grossman called.
Okay.
Norstars.
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
No! No cops! That's final! This is my deal here, Wade! Jean is my wife here!
No, Wade! They were real clear! They said they'd call tomorrow, with instructions, and it's gonna be delivered by me alone!
Well, that's okay, I just -
Yah, looks pretty bad. Two of'm're over here.
Well - it's cold, Margie.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Just a Diet Coke.
And then I, and then I been workin' for Honeywell for a few years now.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
No, I didn't...
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Oh. Oh, my.
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
Uh-huh.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
No, no.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
They're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
You know about the guy who invented it? I hear all kinds of things. Supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  They say he only sleeps one hour a night.  You know about this guy?  Tyler Durden?
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
Who do you think could've done this?
I'd like to thank the academy...
You need to lighten up.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
You're kidding.
Okay.  I'll take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
We'll split it.  You get it the first and third Sunday of the month.
Me too.  I got a stomach full of Xanax.  I took what was left of a bottle.  Might've been too much.
Feel anything?
You fuck me, then snub me.  You love me, you hate me.  You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
What... ?
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Whatever.  I'll take my food to go...
Marla...
No, no, shut up!  I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
Do this for me, Marla.  Do this for me, if you never do anything else...
I did, I think.  But, I'm okay... I'm fine...
Who's this?
Oh, yeah.
Baggage handlers.  But when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Thank you.
Being clever.
This is how we fill up our lives.
I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's a terrible tragedy.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
It affords him other interesting opportunities.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
This is crazy.
Strange.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
Same here.
If you could fight any celebrity?
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
Uh... nah...
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
I don't know...
Fucking sweet.
No.
Why do people think anything?
Sometimes I control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
What... what are you saying?
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
...go through with this? What are you going to do?
...stop me?
You want out?
... no, no, no...
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
You will.  You know you will.
Why do you want to do that? Why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
My eyes are open.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
You and your friend.
Alright, Christ!  Fucking let me go!
No, please, no, God, no!
Yeah, how?
You were there?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
We need to hurry.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Carter.
Blow me.
Who?
Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday morning.
I'm not following you --
Hold on.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
How are we going to find her?  There must be thousands of white vans in this state.
You said she was going to drive into a lake.  How can she when she's in protective custody?
I don't...what if I made a mistake?
Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean?
Sure.
Yeah?
Most kids never have it happen.
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Why do you think I was hiding?
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
In Death...
You saying Tod did kill himself?
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
Start over.
Show me how it operates.
That's what I'm here for.
Fermented fish sauce.
I need a vacation.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
Hold your pantyhose.  Here, gimme a hand.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Go United States.  See Nguyen. Maybe teach economics.  Buy Cadillac.  Watch "Dynasty."
Minigun.  Come on.  Let's move. He's coming in on our open side.
It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
This operation is in two phases. Recon and rescue.  You are phase one.  Your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of American POWs, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
We just take pictures?
Typical...
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
About 22 hours on site.
Nice work.
This mission was a scam from the word go?
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
Can you walk?
Well did you or didn't you?
You threw him out?
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
I'm shocked.  With a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
I was attacked.
No, I'm fine... really...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
My agent.  I called my agent.
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem.  He wants me to come in and talk and... and... <u>that's</u> <u>it</u>!
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
No.
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>... and <u>Pinnochio</u> is a true story... <u>Edwin!  Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale...
I'm... just looking for Parry...
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
A list.
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Well..um...you get an official membership card...  Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry?  You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
No... thanks... Listen --
Sshhhh!
Parry.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
What are you doing?  Give that back!
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY...  ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
The Red...?  You're totally gone, aren't you?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here.  Do...do you want to stay here?
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
In a bar called Hellfire.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Yeah.....Hey they're moving....  Am I doing that?
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Got any Ethel Merman?
Yes.
You treat me like I was.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone...
Five'll do it.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
Well, I don't mean to.  Here's your tea, Tita.
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
Robert, I have to tell you something...
What?
A couple of months.
It's not that bad.
Sort of.
Like what?
I don't know where she is!
Bye, Robert.
At being a fake.
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
I think it's what you think.
That's what you said?
Is he?
Of course I'd like to.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
That'll make you happy.
At any rate, Dad wanted to hire a private detective to ferret you out, and I said, "What for?" Whatever the hell he's doing, even if it's a completely wasteful escapade, it's entirely his business. Simple as that...
Jesus, what a rude person...
You better hold onto your tongue!
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Alright.
Remember me, from the pool?
That's it?
You look good.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I can't man, I'm punished!
I'm not goin' to 10th Street, people piss and shit in that pool,
You know, Eddie's cousin.
I think by Twenty-two.
I think he's 18 or 17.
What she look like?
Yo, that's my girl.
Probably.  One of the many.
So, then whadda ya want?
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
You mean her.
That's what he said.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
What? What are you talking about?
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not a prayer.
What, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear you say something about Rio, Alan. You're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars I staked you for the next load, are you?
Yes.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
That's Babar.
Two bs?
Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
Margaret.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
Just relax....
Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
For sure?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I think I’d rather have drugs.
Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that.
Where am I?
You're in the Records Room.
That's it?
That's it.
Hey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.
Are you serious?
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
Whoops.
That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
You sure did.
Right.
What?
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Twenty years.
Wait here for me, Gummy.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
Precisely. Are you a good shot?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Only if you promise not to return me.
Nothing to it.
John! You used to fly together!
What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied.
I bet you do.
See what I mean?
It's John. John...  Znhcneelsky.
I saved his life during the war.
Depends on the question.
Thanks, I feel much better. Listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to Utah with Alan?
He never sees them and I never met them.
Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
That's what I want to know.
If you need me, call the paper. Hand me that extra bottle okay?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I'm her cousin.
Tell the cops.
I never read the paper.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow?
I have some ideas.
Fletch, I got nervous. Please....
Fletch.
Yeah.
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Who's your decorator?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Zuzu Petals.  You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
They did one of these about my ex- wife.  It's called 'The Nutcracker.'  'The Nut-crack-er'... I don't need money.  I need some questions answered.
Lots of things.  Her favorite yogurt.  The ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
We invested in these factories. In Vancouver.
Assistant.  And don't call me Jazz.
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
I can't believe I lost an eye for a bunch of phony C.D.s
Peachy.
Are you okay?
This is fucking unbelievable.  Zuzu, it's a long story, you see...
Jesus, how could you be so stupid?  Come on, we're going to a hospital.
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Like me.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you.  You look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  I see the beast.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
What's fine?
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
The case!
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Don't worry I can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
Ciao.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
No. 
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
Yeah?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
You made three sales to your roaches back there.  We had to chase you through all this shit and you tell me you're clean?
... Salvatore?...
It's your problem.
It's yours too!
Mmmmm.  That bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
He got off on six.
When ya go back on?
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
He coulda been white.
Drink this.
Whip it out.
Give who a tail?
The greaser with the blonde.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
There's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.
We're goin' now!  Goodbye.
Hiya, Jesus.
This is what the tough guys are wearin'.  You know I only steal from the best.  It's Bonwit Teller.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Just for mistakes of parking?
For garbage?
I'm working with one of the victims outta Brooklyn North.  You mind I take a shot at him?
You're shitting me!
I'm alright, Gibby.
I'd go with you and Chinese take-out over her any time.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
I love you more.
He ain't the only one.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
So am I.
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
What if I told you that in the bottom of the 6th we're gonna be down 3-0.  And Cleon Jones is gonna get hit in the foot. It's gonna leave a scuff mark on the ball.
I know.  Sorry, Dad.
I'll be up soon, Little Chief.
My dad's name was Frank Patrick Sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard Mets fan.  And every night when I went to bed he sang to me...  Take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
Wait a sec...there was something on the news.  Something about this space anomaly.  I think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
I'm thirty-five years old.
Chief?!  Is that you?
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
Whatta you mean...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
That'll never work.  They'll just think you're crazy.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Whatta we do now?
You all right?
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
Johnny, I know, but...
In my pocket.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
My father didn't die in a fire?
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
No kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
A hot shot, huh?
Talk about dumb luck.  Odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. And then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  Bets part is she's the first victim.  She knew the doer.  I'm betting those bones are gonna do a lot of talking.
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to speak to an att --
Going?  How do you mean?
I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this...
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
We haven't looked in the barn, yet.  Let's take a look.
If you insist.
First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you...
Chuck... look.
That's the way it is, man. Cellars are dark.
No.  I can look around by myself. I'll take the upstairs.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
Excuse me, but I believe that's mine...
Stop the car!  Now!!
Who's Horace?
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
Now wait a second!  I thought Burt shot you.
My ass.
Yeah, that's fat too.
Megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
Megan, get away from him.  He's dangerous.
Megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I'll let you know if I hear anything about your counselors.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Then let's get goin'.  We can argue on the way.  You tell me what you need...  ...I'll make sure you get in.
Did you hear me?!
That's debatable.
Yeah, we're here.
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
I got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
Skin stretcher was human.
I'm here.
I need to talk to you.
Twenty.
Look --
Thirty.  Name your price.  Everyone has a price, what's yours?
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!
Tell me.
Her name's Stephanie.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
I'm now begging you.
I know, I know, I'm sorry but the Sheriff is just berserk right now. C'mon.
-- Bad?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
A pizza?!
The Captain's been murdered. The buzz is that Jason might be on board.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
Really?
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
Tell me.
She changed her mind.  Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Have you seen my dog anywhere?
Yeah...a lot.
I heard you weren't coming.
But I didn't get you one...
I'd love to.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
Not completing a voyage is against everything he stands for. But I think I can convince him to call a Coast Guard cutter for you.
But Rennie...
Ride with me. We need a haircut.
We must abandon.
Suffering. You exude a person who sits in a small dark apartment eating soft white bread.
Shit. They don't have any carrot soup.
That's awful.
What was it like?
Do not inhale.
I don't have the problems that artists have.
Had to be him.
Unbelievable.
This could be it.
What about her?
She's dying.
I talked to her two days ago.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
In and out of bed.
That's completely crazy.
Is it?
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Everything.
A flat-out hit.
This building is not secure.
We're strangers in the night. The last thing we want is honesty.
See, Daddy.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
Bring me the bay scallops with mercury poisoning.
That's always been my problem.
I'd forgotten that.
Life is good.
I don't know if I can say that.
A thousand things.
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Where's your elastic brace?
Call me Frankie. And it looks like we're going nowhere.
It's the kid's lucky day.
Now that's a complicated subject.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
Because God loves a winner.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
So what happened since? You're worried about this kid who writes these reviews?
Yes.
What color?
Burnt sienna.
Yes.
I can see her face so clearly. Dear God. My heart was flying out of my chest with love.
Endearing.
He's a very sweet man.
I know you both. Enough. How much knowledge does it take before a man does something crazy.
Yes.
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
Did they take your clothes?
What was he like?
"Hell!"
There are unjust laws -- as there are unjust men.
Not if they arrest me -- or a thousand -- or ten thousand.  It is not only generals who know how to plan campaigns.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
Muslim and Hindu are the right and left eye of India. No one will be slave, no one master.
The fools!  Sorry...
Oh!  Neither have I.  I'm awfully sorry.
It would be five thousand more.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found.  All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Where do we start?
We'll vacuum these streets if we have to.
What a relief.
Now <i>you're</i> here.  Who are your "friends"?
Yeah.  You want to go dancing tonight?
Suit yourself.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
In a corridor.
I'm sorry.  I think I was crying.
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
If you say so.  The stripe.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
German, is that you?
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?  He's a big fan of yours.  He wants to apply here.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
No applause!
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
Hi.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
Just like old times?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Boring.
Is he straight?
You got the parole, didn't you?
I feel like the night before the first day of school.
Bullshit.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
I don't want to go there.
Do it my way.
I think you liked it with him.
If I hadn't killed Beynon., you would have.
Let's do it.
El Paso.
Not now.
No scars.
It's all a game, don't bother me.
Sure...
Oh, Jesus... how?
What's wrong?
Pull over.
We walk.
No, I'm not.
No, I'm afraid not.
I never have any luck.
Oh my God.
Gonna knock down a wall?
Might try that.
Where?
Chicago.
Growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
He took the day off.
Then you do it.
Where we go in1?
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
What's it to you?
That's what I want.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
Two years.
The glucose will begin working in half an hour. You'll feel better then...
Yes, you do, Albert. Talk or I'll kill you.
Yes.
A couple of weeks back.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Oh ay?
Yeah.
Was he?
Yes.
Brumby!
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
What?
Yes, while he was here.
No. I didn't know that.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
What kind of entertaining?
Especially when I play the lead.
Did my brother Frank find out?
And you didn't know her last name?
No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
Nice family, are they? Church-goers and all that?
Why would it?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Who's Brumby?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
I'll bet this one's seen some action.
No.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
You're a bastard.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
Do you want breakfast?
Uh-huh.
They're friends of mine.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
Funny, that.
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
And you should know, if I remember rightly.
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
Can't say I do.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Piss off, Ray.
We've got to take you back to London.
What for? Protective purposes?
You ever get 'em?
They came in and they, you know...
They did.
Eh?
It's too...
You get a bad month, all of a...
Some contest board...
No.  That's absolutely right.
Yes, it is.  And you know who's responsible?
Yes.
Nurses.
He is?
I heard that they were running cold.
Himself?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
What do you mean?
You haven't talked to him.
We're not actually talking about it.
No.  Not actually.
Did you?
Have I said that?
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
...I thought that we were only talking...
I didn't ask to be.
That's right.
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
I am?
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
Were the leads insured?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
A waste of time?  Why?
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
They aren't?
Why don't you think so?
Where was I?
Yes.
Yes.
Why?
You understand?
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
That's right.  You want to go out today...?
Excuse me...
Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm talking about a fuckin' Cadillac car that you owe me...
They took the typewriters, they took the leads, they took the cash, they took the contracts...
...and what is that, John?  What? Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I pray in your life you will never find it runs in streaks.  That's what it does, that's all it's doing. Streaks.  I pray it misses you. That's all I want to say.
...you talk to Murray...
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Yes.
The leads are assigned randomly...
Bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... What are you telling me?
No.  You're right.  That's for later.  We'll talk in a month. What have you got?  I want two sits. Tonight.
Somebody broke in.
All that I'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
Don't fuck with me, John, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
I don't know what you are saying.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Who kept the other half?
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
You stick around I'll pull the memo for you.  I'm busy now...
Call up the bank.  I called them.
"...You look around, you say, 'This one has so-and-so, and I have nothing..."
They...
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
Harriett...
That's right, Shel.
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
Ricky...
Mmmm...
What was yesterday?
I told you.
You tell me again.
She won't listen.
Where are you going...?  This is me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim, anything you want, you want it, you have it.  You understand?  This is me.  Something upset you.  Sit down, now sit down.  You tell me what it is.  Am I going to help you fix it? You're goddamned right I am.  Sit down.  Tell you something...? Sometimes we need someone from outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now talk to me.
What...?  Say the words.
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
It's nothing.
Not to my knowledge, no...
Cop couldn't find his dick two hands and a map.  Anyone talks to this guy's an asshole...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
Fuck the Machine.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
You hear what I said?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
What is this, your farewell speech?
They--excuse me...
They got, listen to me...
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia" file, they's fine.  No.  Swell. 'Cause I don't have to...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your contract went out.  Nothing to...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
I can't.
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
The children can stay.
No, Dad.
Not for strangers; for my country.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
I understand...
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
We were all upset about that.
We're making an investment in Havana.
I want you to help me, Fredo.
No.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Tonight we've been invited to a reception at the Presidential Palace; to bring in the New Year. You and I will go in a special car that's being sent.  They'll have cocktails... then dinner, and a reception with the President.  When it's over, it will be suggested that you take Questadt and his friends from Washington to spend the night with some women.  I'll go home alone in the car; and before I reach the hotel, I'll be assassinated.
What do you want me to do?
And you believed that story.
That's off now.
Am I a prisoner?
She's gone, Tom.
A little care he can ride in with an electric motor.
Alright.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
No questions.
You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked.
Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal.
A little; what's so thought- provoking about that?
This meeting is adjourned.
This committee owes an apology!
If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want.
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
The baby I lost...
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
The money was sent.
Except the President of the United States.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
When do we talk?
You were unfair with them.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
Michael, yes, we was all relieved...
Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you?
It's important.
Sitting right behind you.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
The same assurance we got from you.
We got friends in the commission.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I won't keep you another minute...
Why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
Fuck you.
It still hurt.  A lot.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
You mean us?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
You're sure of that?
You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
Nice place.
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
Yeah?  What were some of your movies?
Really?
Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke.
Broke is more like it.
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
But why?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
What?
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
I'm not, you know.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
Something happened to him?
I want -- I want...
David produced her last picture.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes.
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
Not at all.
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent.
Yes.  Perfectly.
That's what I'm trying to explain.
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
Good-bye.  So nice to see you...
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
She is beautiful.
Of course.  How is the old boy these days?
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
After you then.
You're serious.
Quite.
Then the rumors are true?
I can't believe I'm doing this.
My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
Who do you think?
I do a poaching number. Six-ounce fillets in a saucepan of brine. In 8 minutes, I could cater a goddamn wedding. Plain but flavorful. And it's a good way to show off my Hollandaise sauce ...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
I don't know about that, Randall. He did such a good job on this paper. And another one just came in ...
What do you mean -- ?
You want to come along quiet?
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Peugot convertible ...
And there she is --
There's no one left ...
I think so too --
He's in some trouble ...
You remember that, Kip?
Yes. can you hold, sir -- ?
Oh, for God's sake
Whatcha got left ... ?
How'd you get here? Your Moms give you ride -- ?
What am I supposed to do?
I heard you were pumping gas -
Yeah --
You can handle it?
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
I hear ya. Get me outta this. I'll move to the country. Open a fruit stand...
After a while, it became a little pathetic ... Figured I'd put you out of your misery ...
Dad'd be proud --
The era when crime didn't pay --
That's strange. I'm nervous. Donny's nervous. Everyone's nervous. But not you...
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Now, we go -
Call 'em here -- ?
Mitch.
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
No way ...
A little trick I picked up at the Car Thief Retirement Home ...
The alarms go off ...
I pop your hood; find your siren wires
I bet you say that to all the girls...
Let me worry about The Club ...
They got him to the hospital. He's stable ...
Seeing if you wanted to go for a ride?
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
Is he still working here ?
The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
She soars -
I can tell you who's gonna be on duty tonight. I can tell you how much gas they're using monthly. I can tell you how they used to spend that annoying half-hour between "FRIENDS" and "SEINFELD"...
Excuse me --
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Shit all looks the same here --
Look at Jeannie's kid.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
What?
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
I understand.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
What are you gonna do?
Shit.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
It'll be okay.
I can't do it anymore.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
You what?
If Paulie finds out, we got problems.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
He's hiding, thE son of a bitch, in Florida.
What are you gonna do? Fight with him?  He wants his money.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I can't make any more deliveries.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Look. He's got the whole house in an uproar.
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
I got dry cleaning.
We'll pick it up.
That's important.
But I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds of things. Paulie.  You know me all my life.  I've always done the right thing.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
Paulie, I swear, I'm afraid. The guy's nuts. What do I have to do? Whatever I gotta do, I'll do.
Please?
I was countin' on it.
Sorry, brother.  I don't know what to tell ya. You know all the girls I been with. You been with 'em too, except for Cheryl McGovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
Some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
No, I had to talk him down.
Yeah, I figured now that you got your big job over in Cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and I knew I wasn't gonna drive you every day...
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
Oh...
Okay.
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
Shut up.
The fuckin' Trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. The fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my Uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
I'm Irish.
Why don't you beat off at your house?
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
Codebreaking.
What is it?
It's touching me.
With a Ramses graph on the binary tree--
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
The limit is not found!  The limit is not found.
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
Well... I'll be speaking to your supervisor.
Half-red, half-black--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
Hey, how you doin'?
It's Saturday.
Well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. Professor Gerald Lambeau is a Field's Medal winner. Combunatorial Mathematics. 1986.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I got your card.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
They worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. Ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, Sean. This boy is like that. But he's very defensive and I need someone who can get through to him.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Not at all.
I live right around the corner.
Now wait a minute--
He is at a fragile point. He's got problems--
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Me too.
Why there?
I got one of those too.
You should come. I'll buy you a drink.
There is somebody...
Yeah, Morgan. It's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
That's very presumptuous.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
What is?
No.
How'd it go?
Haven't called her.
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
No, I don't.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Where were you?
So wait a minute. The Red Sox haven't won a World Series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
What did you think?
Define that.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
Don't give me you line of shit.
I know.
I'm Will.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
So you just want to use me and go?
No.
No I haven't...
You know, nothing special.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
How many?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
Fine.
I guess so.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
Well all right, Beethoven. He looked at a piano and saw music. The fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the Ode to Joy. They had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. Stone deaf. He saw all of that music in his head.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Be glad to get my han' on some cotton. That's the kin' a pickin' I understan'.
How 'bout you?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I'll get Rosasharn.
Whatsa matter, Ma? Gettin' scared?
Oh.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
She got to make it.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Okay. Go on.
What's it to you?
Kids?
Two.
Two and a half cents.
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
Ma's shore gonna like it here. She ain't been treated decent for a long time.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
And you ain't ashamed?
That's our place.
I ain't no preacher anymore.
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
Lissen, I heard that before--
I seen your hands. You been swinging a pick or a sledge--that shines up your hands. I notice little things like that all the time.  Got a trade?
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
How come I got to shh? Run out, didn't he?
No, Ma. I'm paroled. I got my papers.
I'd a found you, Ma.
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
Was Granma bad?
Granma's dead.
Since before they stopped us las' night.
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
I'd like to stay. I'd like to be with ya--  --an' see your face when you an' Pa get settled in a nice little place. I sure wish I could see you then. But--  --I guess I won't never be able to do that. Not now.
Me neither.  It's jus' stuff I been thinkin' about. Gimme you han', Ma. Good-by. 
Sure. Good-by.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
I don't wanta rob you, ma'am.
But who done it?
Casy, won't you say a few words?
You do not see either!--not yet!
Won't they ketch us?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Can you pick peaches?
What do you do?
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I'm Martin Blank.
What?
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
To make a long story short...
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
That's part of it.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
It's something I do...
Jesus Christ!
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
I just know.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Excellent. Here they come.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
Whatever.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
I get it.
All of it?
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
Never enough.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
Of course you will.
I have to get my head back into my work.
Wow.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
You lived in Chicago?
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
She did?
Poor thing.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse.  Good... You have a nice seat.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Why?
Okay.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Fine!
Then why do you want to leave?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
That's not true.
Sure.
Who's there?
Yes. We're suing.
Hi.
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
Tch. What are you --
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
What did he say?
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Yeah, what?
What do you mean?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Oh, how sweet.
- See, what you can do for him --...
What?
There's a kid at school says we should've imprint-trained him.
There was this thing on the TV about a guy who does it with geese. He has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  You hear 'bout that, Uncle T?
Be honest, I can't say I did it all myself. My grandma helped me get the words right.
I don't know if I can.
Sure.
We still have a way to go.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Does a horse miss a saddle?
In English, please. I didn't spend ten years protecting the president so I could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
I want it.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
Yeah. Like Rigor Mortis, Habeas Corpus.
Yeah, mom?
What are you doing?
No. No one special.
Okay, I gotta get back to work. I'm gonna be home late.  And would you try and please fill these out?
I'm sorry. Who are you?
I got photographic memory.  It's a curse!  Lisa!
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Okay. I'll copy it.
What?
Uhhmmm... uh gee, uh...
What's up, man? I'm the Phreak!
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
My name is the Plague.
D'you bring those Crayola books?
Alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
I'll take you down there.
You don't owe me anything.
10 years ago? Halloween? He's Jamie's uncle.
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
Can't you find somebody else?
Its too late.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
How do you know their not?
I'm not calling the fire department.
For Christ sakes. Spare me the speech. I've listened to it for a decade.  The fact is that Michael Myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
Police station. I ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
Okay, out.
Oh, serious questions tonight.  Of course I love you.
Jamie, sometimes it's...
Well tonight we're going to do something better. We're going to go trick-or-treating.
Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
Then we'll be safe?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
I don't want to look pushy.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Yeah in the trunk of my squad.
Oh, Sheriff Meeker, my name is Dr. ...
Why?
Where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
What is he? Tell me! What the hell are we dealing with?
Car trouble?
Sort of.
What are you hunting, Mr. Sayer?
All right Rachel, you stay by this radio. The state boys will send word once their in route. When that word comes you go tell deputy Logan.
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
That man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
Why did you hang up on me?
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I've already lost it.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
I wasn't spooked.
He can still watch.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
For that matter, I might as well be a girl scout tonight. I plan on making popcorn and watching Doctor Dementia. Six straight hours of horror movies. Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Yes, you can.
Here, Lester.
And I can't keep you interested?
Just answer the damn phone.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Sure...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Where?
Is Annie around?
Have a good time.
Mom doesn't like me to have them.
There is no such thing.
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?
Tommy, Halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. It's all make believe.
What did he look like?
The bogyman!
I killed him...
Let's make more popcorn.
I don't think this is any time to be funny...
Are you really interested?
Mmm.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh...
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
No, he called late last night.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
I can't resist.
Yes.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
...with the affiliates.
Yes, but you name names.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Oh, oh, yes.  I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Oh, don't say those words!
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Not because of me, I hope.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
Tch, no!  We were, we were both going in different directions.
Oh, all the time.
Is something wrong?
That's where your talent lies.
Mmm.
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
Was I?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Are you angry with me?
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
We were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
It's on the table, Dad.
How can we be happy?
Mom, come out!
No, nothing.
Oh, Frederick!
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz.  More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
Can you understand how meaningless everything is?  Everything!  I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
You look so beautiful.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Y-yeah.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Oh...
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Oh, now-- 
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Wow!
Is there no chance?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
I want to experience childbirth.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
Now, Holly's not shy.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Are we talking about cocaine again?
Oh!
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Yeah.
Look, everything's going your way.
So what's new?
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
What's the matter?
Good.
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
You want some?
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a... 
Well, I hope you've changed.
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
...namely a personality.
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
Have you?
Nobody ever said it.
You have.
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
I hereby acknowledge that...
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
Oh yeah?  Wanna arm wrestle...?
Perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
Or, perhaps...
What have they got you doing?
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
...they did it for a lark.
Hey, I'm fine.  Whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant International Neighbors...?
You tol me you wuunt ask me again til I'm ready....
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
How <u>crazy</u> is that....
All Quiet Along the Potomac...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
...his family has offered a large reward.
Their family owns...
That's why my wife adores me.
That operation has begun.  Are we God, that we would <u>Meddle</u> with it...?  <u>No</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
Good evening, Dr. Lechter.  Thank you for coming.  I am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
He is...?
Mmm...
Why?
For a consideration.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
One moment, and they're at the <u>Seven-</u> <u>Eleven</u>.  They botched the fallback plan, they...
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
It gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
How's your <u>child</u>?
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
You know it?
Well, perhaps sometime we...
I have had the honor. 
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
The government says.  Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  You can't see Mama anymore.  Or Shirley.  Or Kitty Cat.  That's what the <u>Government</u> says...
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
Oh, no, no.  It won't be <u>that</u> long.
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
I hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  Yes.  It's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
And what would be of Greater Help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  DON'T YOU THINK?  IN WHICH THE INNOCENT ARE TORTURED IN WAYS WHICH WOULD MAKE THE ANGUISH OF THE DAMNED SEEM TAME AND UNIMAGINATIVE, DON'T YOU <u>THINK</u>?  BLIND HIM AGAIN, AND PREPARE <u>HIM AND HER</u> FOR THE PIGS! 
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
Because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
...what?
Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I'm going to work.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
What would you guess, Ardelia?
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
I am on the track of...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
And why should we believe you?
I want the money.
You were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
...no...
What does <u>that</u> mean?
Yes, so you said.  But what does that mean:  to go beyond The Institution.
Yes.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Adam. Dollface. We had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
You are the prince of the darkness.
Of course you are. You don't know what I was like before I met you. You're like the best counselor ever.
You guys have been so colossal...
Goodnight, Jasper.
That wants to be a Yes.
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
So what?                                                    ]
Yeah, we talked about sex, too. Oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in...
About ten years a--why...Don't look at these...Come on...Stop.
Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
Not now, Wendy.
Don't get cocky, girl.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
So what was the first day after Heather's suicide like?
But she couldn't handle it.
Yes. Yes. We'll work something out. I swear to God. Won't we J.D.?...J.D.?
Jealous much?
The extreme always makes an impression, but you're right, it was severe. Did you say a Cherry or Coke Slurpee?
I know exactly what the hell you're talking about and you're right, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Let's just grow up, be adults, and die.
I can do Heather's handwriting as well as my own.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
French.
Uh well hey, let's take a look at the homosexual artifacts I dug up. Now, prepare to be a little disappointed.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
Did not.
I was thinking more along the lines of slitting Heather Duke's wrists open and making it look like a suicide.
Shit, we're seniors, Ram. Too old for that crap. Let's give him a scare though.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
Punch it in!
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
People just don't take the name Heather seriously. They should, shouldn't they?
It's all yours, Heather. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go throw up.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
Bye.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
Thank you so much!
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
It's so beautiful!
That idiot boarder?
All right, then.
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
Really? Do tell.
Take no offense Trevor. I see many patients a day and have an awful memory.
No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold.
Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy.
This isn't happening.
There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan 
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
In private.  They got cameras and alla that crap in there. Microphones.
I never really thought they'd go for it.  And then... you didn't come forward, they investigated my war record...  I kept expecting you to show up and expose me...
Right.
You <u>woulda</u> gone in there, you wouldn'ta thought twice...  Trust me on that, that's the kinda guy you are.  For a guy like me, it's a momentary loss of sanity.  I wasn't thinking clearly.  Listen, I'm no hero, John.  I just want some dough and maybe a little favor. How much didja spend already on all that do-gooder bullshit?  You didn't spend it <u>all</u> didja?
Yeah, and with me it was like I was supposed to pretend the shoe was mine.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Twenty-five grand is peanuts!  All you gotta do is get me outta here long enough to collect.
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Hey, you could call me "Bernie," forget the "Mister LaPlante" stuff.  You are naive.
Mister LaPlante...
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Down.  You mean jail?  For that credit card stuff?  For Chrissake, Bernie, your lawyer...
I had to explain your tendancy to "exaggerate", How you were actually "in country" all of two weeks and how you killed about as many people as the other clerk-typists in your outfit, no more, no less...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Uh, no.
No, I don't have the right.  You're a <u>news</u> <u>story</u>!
Vietnam!
That's not what I mean...
I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy...
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
Unprofessional.
A Silver Mike!  You're covering us in glory!
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Listen, Gale, I know you're emotionally involved.  Don't be emotionally involved, be professional.  No, Gale, you are not a hardbitten, cynical hard-ass, you just think you are.  You are a goddamn cream puff!  Try and be a hard-ass!
Dad!
Hello, Mister Wallace.
"This is Gale Gayley for Channel Four News!"  Incredible. Unbelievable!  For Bernie LaPlante! He's a celebrity now?  'Cause he stole <u>paint</u>?
Look at the guy!  He just saved fifty people.  Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
Safety?
Listen, you can kick 'em, hit 'em, pour water all over 'em -- <u>nothing</u>.  I'm telling you, under ordinary conditions they're <u>quiet</u>, they're nice to have around, they're completely harmless -- but when you blow this whistle...  ... then look out.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
Oh -- uh -- girlfriend.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
When I was a child... I got used to the closets.  The boxes.  The cabinet under the kitchen sink... with that persistent drip.  I used to the smell of the boxes. Wood.  Cardboard.  I got so I was comfortable there in the dark. Even... even that old refrigerator in the yard.  That smelled like rust and decay.  It was safe in the boxes.  It was when they took me out --
On the contrary -- this is tremendous.  I mean, we're all frightened to death of disapproval and we're constantly hiding behind these layers we manufacture for ourselves -- and I'm not saying we should, you know, <u>declare</u> ourselves unhesitatingly to our fellow human beings in the interests of total openness and honesty --
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
The same thing -- his business pressures, the whole move and everything.  He's frantic about nailing this new job, worried about screwing over his present boss.
I don't <u>know</u> how it started!
Mom, <u>there's somebody in the</u> <u>house</u>!
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
No, thanks, Mom -- I'll go up to bed now.
We'd have to get one of those sliding covers for the pool.
Stop knowing me so well.
Damn.
What?
Honey, are you okay?
<u>No</u>.  If I hear anything you'll be the first to know, all right?
No.
There's no card or anything.
All new houses have noises.
How long does it have to be a new house?
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Fuck you, Philip.
His secretary just confirmed.
Oh baby.
There might be some extras in the garage.
I am so sick to death of hearing <u>your</u> opinion of my state of mind, what <u>you</u> think is for my own good. Without me you'd still be twirling a baton at U.C. Santa Barbara. <u>You're</u> the final straw on this back, baby!
I'm having the floor fixed,
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
Oh, yes, well, you know, when developers remodel a house they often overestimate their costs at first.  It's not like it's been marked down or anything.
Put it out, man!
Would you mind if Rudolf had a look too?
Can we keep him?
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
Get on the other side of that.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Would you?
Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
Yes.
Yeah -- how'd you know that?
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant.
No.  I don't scare easy.
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
Who are you?
Thomas Cavenaugh.  I am a teacher of sorts.  Like Romeriz I help those newly acquainted with our life.
Yes.
I'm sure they will.
You.
You always get to go first.
I would like to say goodbye.
Your life.
You'll no see me again.
Why?  What's going on?
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
What's going on?  Why did he call you Macleod?
I don't know.
I told you I'm interested in mythology.  We can talk about it more.
I don't know.
I know.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
You also have a power, Conner.  It is why you have survived.
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
It's happening right now.
If the Feds get those disks, the East Coast is gonna take a hit, too.  You should let them know.
She'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
<u>Shut up!  Shut up and get on the floor</u>!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
I'm not going to die for this!
Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
They're fine.
We're not coming in there by force, okay? No one wants to hurt you.
I'm here.
That's not going to happen, Dennis.  They won't give you a helicopter.
I'm going to put on an officer named Will Maddox.  You talk to him for a while.
Maybe that's what I'm doing.  Can I reach in my pocket, show you something?
Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
All you're doing is watching yourself on TV.  <u>Look</u> at him.
Find something, Kevin.  Don't just stand there.  And tie this bastard, too.  I don't want him waking up and goin' Rambo on us.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
I don't know.
You have his address?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here, goddamnit! Where are they?
You'd better be kidding.
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I'm not gonna leave you!
I don't drink beer.
Kevin, my father needs a doctor.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
How can we get out?
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
We only have eight officers on duty, Chief.
Tell her I'm almost home.
They might be at the house.  Keep trying and let me know.  I'm going to be here a little while longer.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
That's why you get the big bucks, Captain.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
The doctors are taking care of him right now.  Thomas . . . are you safe?  Can you talk?
I'm serious, Thomas; I don't want you to get hurt.
Can you get into the office?
Charles G. Benza.  They're coming!
These guys are going to take hold of you. Don't freak out.  It's for your own good.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of General Bizimungu.
No. I work at the Mille Collines.
Do you know how to open the safe there?  Our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. You must open it.
Where is your family?
How much?
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  Paul will look after you.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
Whiskey?
The Americans, and the UN they have you as a war criminal. You are on a list.
You will tell them the truth.
I will do nothing unless you help me now.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
) You cannot kill them all.
What is it?
You’re drunk.
When will they be here?
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I saw the sign.
This goes out live?
I will remember that name.  Let's go.
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
How do you know?
We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
He wants your wisdom.
You could have asked for a favor.
He was not family. Family is all that matters. Do you think if you or I were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
It will do just fine.
What about us?
So where is the lamb?
Go out! Where?
What?
Why?
It was substantial.
A Volkswagen!
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
Thank you, sir.
I'm confused.
-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
Not yet.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
Did it work?
I thought she was dead. For sure.
You need to get out more.
-- that's the fact, bud --
Eddie Moses, Communications Attache -- which translated from ancient bullshit means: I work for a Messenger service.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Haven't they already?
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
I know.
Really? Well, let it rip.
A simple leak, if it's okay with you.
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
And then what happens?
I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe.
-- my loss --
Not the plates: the House. Why is no one listening to me?? It's alive!  And once it's made up its mind, it won't let anything out.
What?
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Blackburn's dead.
-- ten.
What's the matter?
There were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  I went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
Yes.
We're going to go someplace new.
Where is she now?
I want this one, daddy.
Aubrey knows more about us than you think.
You didn't think much about that before.
To our family.
Not really.  She was just one of those names you hear growing up. You know, so-and-so who lives in Ireland.  I really don't think anyone knew about this place.
Know what?
What?
I wish I had an answer.  Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
Oh.
There's something through that wall!
And I believe what you say.  But this is TV.  No pictures, no story.
I don't know ...
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
God, no!  Nothing like that.  No, he died before I was born.  He died in Vietnam.  I never knew him.  Never met him.  We don't even know the details.  I dream of battlefields.  Of searching. Of trying to find out.
That's what I'm trying to tell you! ...
Ha!  I don't know yet.  First time. Kitchen virgin, that's me.
Who's that?
Oh, Terri ...
You gonna buy?
You're JP Monroe, right?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
No.  Thank you.
What did you see?  The same as I. Appetite sated.  Desire indulged.  You saw the working of the world in miniature.
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
But how in God's name ...
God?  My God was diamond and black light.  And I was his Dark Pope.  All that is changed.  A terrible beauty is born.  With a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
It was so beautiful!  When the blanks went off, they...
Show off.  Hey, boss tune.  "Come Fly with Me."
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
Oh man, you still got a thing for those unmasculine European coffees? Who's your buddy?
Oh, not much.  Mario Brothers want me to do a job.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
"And though he's slippery, he still gets caught."
Morning edition.  Seems two thieves "attempted" to steal it last night, but thanks to three "courageous" guards, it will be ready for tonight.
Anna, I think you better stay....
Get em....
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Sorry.  Seventeen Hail Marys and five minutes outside.
Said.
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh.  Well, what's this?
I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
The pleasure's all yours, Officer Gates.
That's the beauty.  It's bullshit, but I can make it stick because I'm a good guy parole officer and you re a bad guy who's about to find out that there's a thin line between ex-con and escape con.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
The Hoop-dee-doo!
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
A sawbuck!
Muncie!
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Every year?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Consider this my resignation --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
I got big ideas, though!
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Failure to deliver a Blue Letter is grounds for dismissal.
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
I --
You --
Wait a minute!
Oh my God, sir!
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
She sits down.
She looks in her purse...
He don't look wise.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
She is!
Thank you for waking me.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
Where?
That's nonsense, Alma.
No, miss.  He's just as he was in the beginning -- on the front part of an enormous boat.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
It's the very danger itself that makes the cure possible, Mr. Holland.  The insulin produces a state of coma, a stupor.  The patient is revived from the coma by a violent overwhelming nerve shock. That nerve shock can kill -- but it can also restore the damaged mind.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
That doesn't sound like him.
But she's not dead, Wes.
Yes, thank you.
Of course not!
I often do.
I don't know.  I wanted to help you. And now that I'm here, I don't know how.
I took Mrs. Holland to the Houmfort.  I thought they might cure her.
Why?
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Rough day. Good night.
Hmm. Good night.
That shirt?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
I know, I know. I had no idea --
We're not going anywhere.
Classes?
Grades?
Anyone special? You know...
Jimmy? Jimmy? I don't know how to take this. And what do you mean, Jimmy? I thought you said you and your husband --
I'm not interested in your smart ass remarks now, lady. Let's go. Right now. You and I can discuss it on the walk home.
C'mon.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Alright dad. But you sold the house, you didn't tell anyone, including the IRS, and I'd of certainly liked to have seen if there was any old stuff --
Thanks for the advice Dave.
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Phone's out. I hope the pipe's --
We were just riding around.
Mom. Are you ok?
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
Well I of course flatter myself that our church is not exactly what most people would call organized religion -- at times it's the disorganization that's liberating -- and of course I've begun to minister much more in what one might call therapeutic environments, in small groups, and one on one, couples --
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
See ya.
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Let's see!
My what?
Hah hah you're funny. A bath. Like a brother and sister. Oh man, I'm so wasted.
It's beyond mere physical attraction.
You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
I'm not good at math. Just geometry.
Yeah. When it freezes, I guess that means the molecules are not moving. So when you breathe, there's nothing in the air, you know, to breathe in to your body. The molecules have stopped. So it's clean.
Then why'd you come after me?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
The ones you built?
Yeah.
What are you doing?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Five feet?  Seven feet?
Byrd's dead.
No.
Did she?
Seven years.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
What was?
I said you're going to get a phone call.
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
Then there is nothing.
I have not spoken to him...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Knew? You mean he is...
If you say so. You are innocent.
But you asked the wrong questions. Do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? How quickly they perish of their own will.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Not you my dear.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
The swamp...
I can't. Go away from me.
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Love holds you to me. And we are in danger, not you.
It's only mortal death.
How do you mean, start?
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Dying?
You have fed. You were made for this...
You need company, Louis. More congenial than mine...
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
You have it...
That's what I do. I interview people. I collect lives. F.M. radio. F.F.R.C. I just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
Saw you in the street outside. You seemed interesting. Is this where you live?
What about coffins?
And did you lose her? Did she go?
And you know what you ask for?
A child who can't die...
No means yes.
Nope. I told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. And then he came anyway.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
But, he said he'd try.
Not me...no way...
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Is he?
Can't what?
You sure?
To get out of Southport?
Deep breaths --
You've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
It's...him.
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
Why?
Hey --
How's Julie?
Alone. In the room.  Got any advise?
He's probably the only one who can help us.
Well, there's some flaws in her...
Excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I've never seen a dead body before.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
The Greeks thought death was beautiful -- an adventure --a journey to another world.  But I have my other guests to think of -- The General will be wanting to go back to his army. If you'll excuse me --
You collect these to sell, abroad?
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
My friend -- what can one say --
They were gore before I came here.
No.  She shall not be left here.
How could we go back to the wars with such pleasant company here..
I think not.
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
That should decide it or you --
You and your mysterious illness. A new attack everytime you are crossed — everytime you can't get your own way.
Didn't you? But now -- what are you thinking now?
) But Thea -- She stands in your way. I know you. I know your little hints —— the way you can turn the truth into a lie --
You're planing something, Cathy.. But I won't let you —- I'll warn them against you.
Really, this is idiotic!
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
I don' t know. When I was gone the people from her village came to my home seeking vengeance. They bore her away with them. Months later she came back ——pale -- sick -- she died --
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it —- he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Are you running a business or a charity ward?
Sure I have, but I got rid of it.
Who?
What did . . .
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
It isn't me!
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow –– you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Zuzu's petals.
Where is she?
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Oh, this afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.
No charge.
I'm all right.
Hmmm . . .
Hmmm?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Okay.  What's yours?
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Harry . . . Harry . . .
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Where are you going?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
I know, but . . .
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
All of it?
The whole town's gone crazy.
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Ummmmm . . .
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Where'd you get that dress?
Well, then, sit down.
Left them at the office.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Going up to see Zuzu.
With the right wind, 15-20 knots.
You going to the lighthouse?
Soon, dark eyes, soon.
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
I think we're changing course a little.
I could give you a dozen good reasons.
We better go back in.
Oh, out a ways.  Maybe the lighthouse.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
You're betting what you already got.
Want to talk about it?
Diver's camera.  Tom Andrews brought it up from under that abandoned cruiser.
Could you just keep that crowd back, please?
Positive I.D.?
Got it.
What else is there to do?
Okay, okay.
At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Sean's still out there.
Heck of a way to treat a taxpayer.  Don't you have any pull with the chief, here?
The what?
What shark?
We don't know that, do we?
I know that this was probably a Great White Shark.  Car-cadon... Caradan....
Don't be ridiculous -- Sharks don't take things personally.
I did, I did.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Terrific.
That's great.
Stop that!  We're not going any place.  You love it here.  Tell me what the hell happened!
Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is.  What did they....
Fired me!  I'm not a hysterical man.  I'm responsible.  I know what I saw....
Turn in the car.  Clean my desk, explain things to our sons, then maybe get shit-faced and punch your boss.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Very impressive ceremony.  Good speech.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches!  In New England? We all lost on that one.
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Someone has to do something.
Yeah?  Then what?
Did you say Cable Junction?
I know.
Shut up.
What're we going to do in the mean time?
And second?
Anything?
Oh, great.
Is there something I don't know about?
Maybe you and Brooke could come over to the town beach....
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Your ass I will.  Besides, the wind's turning with the tide. Sailing back is going to be a bitch.
Might as well.
Not tonight.
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
How was dive class?
Yeah.
Len, can I see you a minute?
With those camera lights and...
No.
Everything's going wrong.  I'm having more trouble with Bobby than I ever have before.  I can't get him to respond.
I don't like what he does.
It's his work.
Look, Michael... you don't have to come.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Nothing.
That we swim.
Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
Up.
I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming!  You'd think you're gonna leave me?
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
No.
Michael, I don't have time. Please!  It's time you dealt with this and got over it.  Now come on!
I can't take water, Kathryn.
This tooth is from another shark. A shark that could be 30 feet long!
You wanted to know about a cave?
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Me.
Only to myself.
Wait a minute.  These aren't kangaroos, Mr. Hutton.  They're dolphins.
No, no.  That won't do.
I like it when they wake up.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
Sure.  No problem.
Thanks.
I'm Neo-Senephrened out.  Think I'm catching a cold.
And alone.
It's okay, Sean.
Hold still, damn it!
What're you doing later?
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
No, South Georgia.
The world's southern most reaches.
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
It's large enough...
No way.
I'm sure you won't.  But you're going to have to wait till we come up.  Then you can film all you want.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
Sharks???
Gee, it's good to see you!
Give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
It sure is....
No....
I'm not on vacation....
You caught me....
I always thought when I grew up I'd know what to do about things like this...I don't even know if he's serious....
I'm not doing anything.
I'd like that.  I need to be away from here.
Thanks for the consultation....
I want you to give up that terrible job.
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
Good.  So will I....
No more sharks.  I'll stay for another week, then....
Children are never satisfied.  I have my house, my friends, my job...My life, Michael.  I have to live it. Besides, I'll be back.  Now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
You look tired....
Why'd you come out here?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
I borrow it without telling him....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
Will you get the bloody hell out of here....
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
If you'd leave me alone, I'd be able to get my work done....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
Money is money....
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
Stop that!
Screw you, Jake....
We need it to eat electronics, man ...Not you.  Get it on me....
In a few minutes....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
Old guy, offed himself with a knife. I can't find the knife.
"Welcome to Eureka."
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
How'd you do it, old man?
What do you mean, Ross?
To throw out of the window.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
That's what I'm here for. I want you to come and see Citrine with me?  He's not gonna here it from me but I know he'd listen to you.
Now?
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
Don't underestimate me .. the Mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you been up at that institute?
No.
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
Cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. He's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
Average rainfall, 48 inches. Pisses down, October to June.
Popeye wasn't old. Younger than you.
No .. But we have a theory ..
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Alright, I gave him the case? .. So the case is closed, so what?
Me?
Of course I would ..
No.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
I know.
Who?  Probably Angelo .. I'll take care of it .. Don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be O.K. .. O.K.?
Please don't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
The man from the F.B.I.
Grateful for your candor, Sir.
Two or three years ago.
What was she like?
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Well, that's who she is. Cept she can't run away.
He tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." Well, give me a fucking break! There <u>is</u> no "Ser- ial Killer." Stick her name up in neon, there's still no Serial kil- ler! And I ain't the only one say- ing it. Everyone in this building is saying it. And I mean <u>everyone</u>.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Whatta you mean, "horrible?"
That's right.
Look, I don't want a --
I think you added the "brutal."
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Wait.  What do you mean?
Talking and saying nothing, man, it's an art I have not mastered.
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, take care.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
No no, I know --
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
Hi.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Good evening.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Same to you.
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too.  That about says it...
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Call me tomorrow.
Another drink please.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
Rod, get on the camel.
How do I know?
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
Why not --
It's the death rattle of my singlehood, right? Because I finally see the white picket fence looming and I love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you're right, I'll know when I see him. Why is it so easy to talk with you?!  Tell me about your fiancee.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
To the pools?
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
Alright, I'm freaking too.  But they need you to stay calm.  I'll call back. _ 124.
Pleasure.
Dick.
Yeah I know.  I did.
What did you say?
Just drop it Paul!
Eric...
Eric!
I should have tried. It should have been me on that beach back there, not Billy.
But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm glad about that.
I would completely support that.
How low?
Sure.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
That's because it wasn't on their list. Who knows what else they were up to?
To a degree we never imagined.
On the island.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy. Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
A true hunter doesn't mind if the animal wins.  If it escapes.  But there weren't enough escapes from you and me, Ajay.  I've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death.  Maybe I just feel too close to it my--
Is there anything we've forgotten? Anything at all?
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
I'm fine... I'm fine...
What?  Why?
Good lad.
You're kidding yourself.  An adult T-rex cares about one thing -- filling its own belly.  It acts the way people wish they could, that's why everyone's fascinated by it.  If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only, ninety-nine percent would --
Good.
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
What do you think they want?!
For sixty seconds, maybe!  Look at this!  You could-
I think she's with Sarah!
I don't care about my life.  But if I'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger --
That's a scientific impossibility, you know.  Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Whatever you study, you also change.
I swear to God, it works with lions sometimes!  There we are -- your baby is free --
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Birdshit?
You think this is all a joke?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
Where's Ian?
You're sure we have to?
How am I supposed to transport them?
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Oh my God.
Why?
They smell.
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
Alan, listen to this.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Why not?
In a box under my seat.
Forty-eight hours from now, I'll be accepting your apologies.  Now get out of the way.  So I can see them!
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
Could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Occasionally.  Always on the lookout for the future ex- Mrs. Malcolm.
Yeah, they hate me.
Kids get scared.
Well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog DNA to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  They mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  Now, some West African frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  Malcolm was right!  Look, life found a way!
Timmy, listen to Dr. Grant!
There's nothing that great about discovery.  What's so great about discovery?  It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
Thanks, Steve.
Sure.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
What?
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Get rid of them.
I think we're lost.
His camera... it's still recording.
Come on.
What are the charges?
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Did you find a scalpel? Did you find a murder weapon?
I always throw that in. It makes the jury feel sorry for the defendant.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
My job is not to determine his guilt or innocence. That's up to the jury. My job is defend him.
Wait a minute. Let me see that. She hands him the file.
So what do we do?
About ten minutes.
Have you worked here long?
-- Small.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
Did you?
The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man.  Very good.
The <u>Castle</u> cemetery.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
Did you see him?
Oh, don't they?  I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
I did not realize it was obligatory.
I do.
I see -- it's just the Erlanger claim then.
One of you must be mistaken.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
-- I've just come from the Castle.  It's over.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Yes.  Since he came to the office, almost three years ago, we've been quite good friends.  How was Eduard ...
Was he depressed?
His landlady knew of no other friends to refer us to.
What did she say?
You mean you've actually begun some?
I can't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
It's gone out so quickly?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Now Ann ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
What was it, Jack?
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Can't you see I'm strung out?  Please, we're waiting for it -- he's got to have it!
Yes?
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
Well I have to close up now.
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
From the beginning I don't know why the hell he's messin with you. If he was me he'd know better. If he was even a city boy he'd know better. You're a whore Miss Daniel, that's the truth of it, right? Now somethin I'd like you to look at.
-- We can talk --
-- Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Could I ask some questions?
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
How else do you meet them? Pimps? 
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
No, I said what did you think.
Yeah, you got to me.
Mm.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Arlyn Page.
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Don't worry.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
My bed.
Mm.
Bree --
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
How do you know how bad it was?
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
How is it back there?
Well there's a couple --
Yeah.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
It's in the report.
All right.
OK and one of them  Jane McKenna -- she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know? -- Bree comes first? And evidently she knew the freak --- that he was a dumper -- she conned me into passing him to Bree, you know, so Bree'd get hurt. I didn't know. Till afterwards.
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Town Police.
No.
Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York?
What about Grunemann's letters to the girl, everything like that?
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
No sir, we don't state that. We're countin --
Oh, sure.  Here, this can be mommy.
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
Show.
I'll call Thelma and remind her, okay?  Don't worry.
You are not allergic of onions.
Tough shit.  You're stuck with me.
Uh huh?
Sleep tight.
Yep.
Is that really your chair?
Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"
Why does he decide?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
I see.  Well, you'll have to do better than that.  Do you have any affidavits to support negligence?
Then I have concluded my questions.
Yes.  Very much.
No questions.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
No.
Was he unfaithful?
No.
Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I'm not taking him with me.
Yes...How's Billy?
He is...  You sat in that coffee shop across from school--
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Oh, God...Oh, my God...
What?!?
Right.
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
I'm going to take it.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Fine.
Good.  You've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer, Mr. Kramer.  How old is the child?
What if I fight it?
I'll take my chances.
It's going to cost.
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
You're on your own, understand?
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Ted, I just heard...
Ted, what are you talking about?!
Where are you from?
Can I do anything I want?
Where will you keep them?
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
He is a capable man.
He had been sick from the time you began growing in me. We thought he would die.
I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
Please.
Is that big?
Will we ever be in war?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
You decide.
True.
You decide.
I would not know. Maybe.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Eliminate you.
Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
Thank you.
He's not gonna hurt <u>me</u>.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
If he's eaten in the area, he shouldn't be far away.  Crocs hang around the food source.
<u>No</u>!!  What's with digging the holes?
Everybody out, back to your tents, <u>now</u>!
And you like me.
You're crawling around like a--
A spring trap!
They don't really attack underwater and--
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
'Cept he wasn't before, was he?  You know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. You're fat.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
No.
They could try to tranq him on land.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Are we all museum bigots in Maine?
I didn't fly up here to roast marshmallows--
I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
Police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  They just want us to sit tight.
You <u>did</u>, you--
Just forget it.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
You're mushing it a little around the--
You wouldn't?
You wanna ride in my truck?
Yeah, I thought about that as I was driving... and... I haven't found somebody in my world.  You found anyone in yours?
Probably not.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
Well.  At wakes.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
Well.  He's probably rugged handsome I guess.  Yeah.
<u>That</u> was a bust.
Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Wait.
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Part of our research--
Liar?
Never cock. Just squeeze.
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
The worst part - the thing that's making me crazy - is that Bill is right in front of me. Only I can't see him...  Lecter said, everything I need to catch him is right here, in these pages...
The one that was weighted down. Where is she...? Fred something.
He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never.
Listen, I hope you never need a thing I've taught you. But you've got something... Jack sees it, I do too. If you ever need to, you can shoot.
You're all right! Where is he?
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
A pretty young woman, to turn him on? I don't believe Lecter's ever seen a woman in eight years. And oh, are you ever his "taste" - so to speak.
Good. Then you should be able to remember the rules.
Good idea.
That wasn't me.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Mr. Gordon, did you know Fredrica when she worked for Mrs. Lippman?
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
Who's the subject?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
You seem pretty sure of that.
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony.
You get to travel around and stuff? I mean, better places then this?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Memory, Officer Starling, is what I have instead of view.
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
No. I only hoped that your knowledge -
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Ahhh... Why?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
Why so briefly?
The personality inventories would trip him up. Rorschach, Wechsler, House-Tree-Person... He wouldn't test like a real transsexual.
Then tell me how.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. Precisely. We begin by coveting what we see every day. Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice? I hardly see how you couldn't. And don't your eyes move over the things you want?
Goodbye, Clarice...  You looked - so very lovely today, in your blue suit.
Did you breast-feed her?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
What?!
And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with?
Miss.  May I?
Winter with the Delaware, my father's cousins. And in the spring, cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee.
Excuse me...
That is the truth!
This is it, as far as we can go... If we're lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have come this way and must've beached our canoes and headed cross land. If we're very lucky, they'll figure we went over the falls.
... and while they are cooped up in your fort, what if the French send war parties to raid their homes?
Sir!!!  Third rank! Twelve paces! Forward march!
Fire!
"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.  When his women want to eat, he lay aside his tomahawk to feed their laziness."
Gifts?
Three, four oxen... much wampum.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not you.
Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men become friends.
My colors?
La victoire.
He did.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
What?...
He did.
What dead one on the ship?
Fuck your orders!
You screw around like that again and--
Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
Beautiful.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
How's TransOcean doing?
What was it?
I'm on the way to the looney bin?  Hey, man, I'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
I feel it, too...Someone's trying to get out.
I'm going to kill it!
Under there?
I don't know.  I'm guessing.
Let's hope it holds.
Sixpack...
Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
I'm not touching you!
The latch is screwed up.  Or the hinge.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns because if you don't . . .
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.
You had better be careful.
Just carrying a bag.
Sure is.
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
All right, Kenny.
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
What the fuck is going on?
Plank?
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over because you can borrow.
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!
And?
I think you'll find it is in your interest.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.
And that does include the amp?
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
Leave your sister out of it.
They stole our land--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
No, sir--
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
I am, sir.
Because it's a job?
Charley Wade.
So?
You still going to all the home games?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
He does.
Fifteen years in El Paso.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass.
You could take it--
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
Take that pair over in the corner--
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
Right.
Because I'm your father.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
No te molestas. Tenemos a ella. [Don't worry. We've got her.]
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
You have somebody else out there?
We was crossin' the river--
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
He was a unique individual.
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Seems like we have another one every week.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
You go by your old house?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
He still living?
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
You told me one time it was true love.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
What was your deal with him?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
They've got my Amado.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Nothing.
I came back 'cause you were here.
So what are we gonna do about this?
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
You sell much out here?
Hell of a spot to put a business.
The other one? Hell, at my age, every time you learn a new name you got to forget an old one. Your head's all crowded up--here it is--
Tell him he can keep them. The Bellboy looks puzzled.
I think maybe he taught Swann.  This is me.  See ya around.
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
D'Amour.
It's him... it's him.
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
And are you afraid?
You don't?
Does that mean...?
I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there.
That's my business. Harry.
He taught all this to Swann?
Some or it.
And Pimm and Swann.  Only Nix was ready for them.
Somebody killed him.
New one on me.  Okay.  Let's see him.
I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
Fuck you.
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
You know of him?
A ticket home,
She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone.
You want more money, is that it?
Yes.
We've got to get you to a hospital.
A Mister Quaid?
Does anybody?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen.
Or murdered, like Nix.
He deserved it.
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
Fuck.
I can't... I can't go any further...
Call me tomorrow.
Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things,
What about Philip Swann?
You don't think I've got it to give?
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
Two years.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Thanks.
I know. I don't either.
I don't know.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
I don't remember.
Ok, whatever you want.
Oh, for her show?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
But, I'm mean.
And marriage, does that get easier?
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
They really have to work on that street name thing.
How old is she?
Fuck off.
Yeah.
I don't want to be.
Oh?
What are you talking about?
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
What?
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
One moment.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Ok.
It's Susan's cooking, Claire.  That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
Bad?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
I spaced out.
Yes.  It's exactly...
Quiet.  Real quiet...
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
Father Jeremy and Deacon John Townsend of St. Ursula's, and our associate, Maya Larkin.  Secular assistants are permitted if regarded as qualified.  Maya is eminently qualified.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
You just call?
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
And also that...
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
What do you mean?
Well, why should I?  Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
We need all the help we can get.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
And what about you?  What about Peter Kelson?  Where is your moral compass?
Of course.
Yeah, yeah.  I've heard it before.  Just be sure you spell my name right.  Nine o'clock?
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
Where is she now?
Oh, all that work.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
She's alright.
Are you okay?
You're a caterer?
This time get your feet set.
It's okay.
I don't wanna see that.
Four days.
A horse?
I'll take that as a compliment.
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
She don't know how to box, I bet.  My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
Okay.
For how long?
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Please.
I don't.
Guess not.
What?
So you're gonna act salty all night?
What has he been to me?  I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  Like it was easy.  And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
Woman...
Talk to your new girlfriend.
I just said I didn't fuck around.  But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
You forgot to be there.
Uh huh.
Thanks.
What are the doctors saying?
We won the championship.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Like what?
Maybe go back to school.
Wow.
What?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
One game.  One-on-one.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
So?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Nona, please.
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
I've been hearing you.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's?  He wouldn't lie.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
Tell me what?
I ain't a damn liar.
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
Look, I'm busy.
You ok?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
C'mon, Jimmy, snap up, snap up --
I'm telling you right now, I'm fine. I lost my goddamn balance and I couldn't see a moment, but I'm ok.
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
OK.  See:  Frank TJ Macky is Earl Partridge's son....
Sure is.  So why call me?
He's not my boyfriend.
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
GET THE FUCK OUT.
No one else in there with you?
Yes.  I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left.  I'm sorry.
You don't have a boyfriend?
Claudia: Why don't you let me handle the questions and you handle the answers, ok?
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
Bye, bye, Claudia.
Well...is that illegal?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
It's my favorite place --
Great, bye.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
...yeah...
Let's make a deal.
You really use strong language.
-- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
No, I'm sorry.  I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
That was so great what you just said.
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
Son, please, now....
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
No Can Do.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
I'm about to get off the elevator --
-- Samuel Johnson.
"Why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, Chapter Right Here, Verse Right Now.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
Two years! Two years later and out of your paycheck, I never charge interest --
You don't need braces.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do?  Then What?
He has Phil right now.
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
She loves you.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
No, no, the grade...the grade that you're in?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Hi.  Is Frank there?
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
Ok.  So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
Is that still lingering?
I would just want to clear some things up:
Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over --
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Yes.  I didn't know how to find you. Earl asked me, so I looked through the adress books and there was no number, nothing --
Yeah.
It's interesting.
I am calm.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
Don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and I'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
I don't have to answer your questions.
I live alone.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
I didn't hear anything.
THAT'S NOT MINE.
I won't.
I need you to get me Paula --
I'm sorry, Stanley.
As fast as I can.
Will that help?
Paula.  Ellen.
I don't.
I don't know....
...No....
Yes you do.
No.
Movie Of The Week.  I went up for one this morning with Alan Thicke and Corey Haim --
I don't wanna do it.  Why can't one of you do it --
I have to go.
....it's alright....
Yeah.
I'm fine. nothing.
Yes.
Alright.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Hi.
Yes.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Cause he hates me....he hates me so much.
I hate it.
I have money.
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
His plight is obvious, isn't it?
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Physical resemblance is but one small thing!  Louis has an arrogance, a manner --
You grow fond of him.  That's good.
What you're asking is impossible!
But --
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
So they tell us.  But what are we to believe when the king is a tyrant, and the Church, meant to stand for all those oppressed, has become the tool of oppression?  When no conscience is tolerated?  No dissent, no objection?
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
But why?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
Michelle cannot possibly accept!
Die?  What...?
Athos, my friend!
Another?  How many times have you saved his life in this year alone? Three?  Four?
The cannons killed Raoul!  The cannons, and love.  But not the King.
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is that?
I decided it this morning.
I already know about the riots, d'Artagnan, I heard them out there whispering.  Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food.  I will deal with it tomorrow.
At least help Raoul.
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
No.  Even if I could give up my friends, I could never give up my son.
No, Keeper.
Two-thirty-seven:  "... And the descendants of Japeth are these: Obediah, Zebulon, Hezekiah..."
What was the end page?
It's lovely.  It's just...
This is more than you are used to. Your mother is a seamstress, your father is dead.  You have three younger sisters, two of whom suffer from consumption.  Don't look so surprised, Kings know such things.
Listen, my darling... Raoul was a... a good friend.  And now he is dead and that is very sad but --
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
Every step of the way.
Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
What do you think?
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Where do you come from, Marvosa?
I'm done talking until I get a lawyer.
She stole my car!!
It wasn't in the cards.
And what did he do to the girl?
What exactly did you see?
Found what?
Neither did I.  I'll make it up to you, I promise...
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
I killed them.
It was self-defense, Tubbs! They're dirty!  I walked in on something, I don't know what -
Alright...alright...you've saved my ass enough times.  What do you want to do?
1490...Breckinridge...
Let's see what we got...
A bank?
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Don't worry about me...  ...and don't forget your helmet. You don't want to get a ticket.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
County jail - get in.
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
Not the Bible?
Library of Congress.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think.  I came down here to get away from all that.
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Personal ads?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Wait, Will...
When I'm done.
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
How do I know?!
Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
Stay in the trees.
Let's get to the physical.
What's being photographed?
Yes, are you okay...?!
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too?
I'll get my purse.
It's me.
Yes.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Yes...
'No' what?
God, no.
Absolutely,
Yeah. It's right here.
Okay.
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Thank you very much.
You tell me what you know about him. I'll tell you whether you're right or not.
The report didn't mention nails and eyes.
'Intimate? !"
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Mmmmh... I love you, too, Will. Good night.
I love you...
Will...
I'll come inside with you, if you like, but Mr. Crawford said you'd probably want to be alone.
There's a VTR setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. They transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch VHS.
I was in the psychiatric wing. It bothers you, finding out I was in there... doesn't it?
You went in the apartment?
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
It's about Atlanta and Birmingham.
Why should I tell you?
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
That's interesting.
What do you want?
It feels good because: if you do as God does, enough times, you become as God is: powerful...
You got it.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.  Caspiar.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
No to the whole thing.  None of it sounds good.
You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!  And you -- you're the road manager! You should be watchin' out for him!
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
Oh!
You're a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
What?!?
Are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm only acting crazy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
Yeah.  They don't know whether to be sad, or angry.
Bob Gorsky.
Oh shit.
What?
I know.  It's her fault.
All the time.  It's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
You don't, do you?
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
No!
I need an exit!  Fast!
Cypher?
Nearest exit is Franklin and Erie. An old appliance store.
Are they any agent?
They'll be able to track it.
The Matrix?
Do you want to know what it is?
Your muscles have atrophied.  We're rebuilding them.
Wild, isn't it?
Your mind makes it real.
Look again.
No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
And she knows what?  Everything?
I told you I don't believe in this stuff.  No matter what she says I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
Morpheus, I don't know --
Trinity!  Go!  Get to the basement. Find the catch basin!
Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
What?
What?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
What?
That the Matrix cannot tell you who you are.
That's different.
Is it?
She told me...
I don't know.  It just went dead.
What?
The Oracle.
I know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  I can't logically explain to you why it's not. Morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  I understand that now. That's why I have to go.
I'll be all right.
An Agent!  You have to send me back!
Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
Of course, 'The Season of the Witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
That means it's good.
Well, maybe they do that in Riverdale, but down here we take cash.  Now, you got it or not?
'And with your spirit.'
'Thou art then a king?'
'Thou sayest it; I am a king.  This is why I was born and why I have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
You flew before?
No.
I bet 235.  Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt...
Johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
Should I slap him?
You sick or what?  You forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
It's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
Big deal...in the meantime, it's done...I'll still try to help you out...You know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
What pipes?
What can I say?
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of.  I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing.
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
Fine.
Fine.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
Bye.
No you weren't.
Oh...around...why?
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
Yeah.  That's what I said, sick in the head.
What do they expect you to say?
All right.
What was it?
Nothing.
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
Sure...He lives there?
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Yeah...just had it delivered...
Yeah, it's your father's.
Well...no.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
No.
A name?
We've got some things to discuss.
Pinot Grigio.  We're considering it for the appetizer.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
Both.
Right away.
Include me out.  I've had enough of the conversations.
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Hot or cold.
Yes.
I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
You have a way with words.
I am now.
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Over my dead body.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
No lawyers, Drew.  We're going to offer you a deal.
You get not to go to jail.
Well, that's very interesting.
Go right ahead.  Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting.  And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
Some spot you pick.
Make it go 'way.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
Sure.
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Yes?
You're welcome.
What do you mean 'free'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
Peanut butter.
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
I appreciate you --
I mean I appreciate that.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
I loved it.
Where are you going?
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
I believe that, don't you?
-- Yes?
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Thank you.
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say.  It's a truth exchanged between two people.
You've got a deal.
There's one to every rule.
So can I.
I don't understand.
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
Easy, Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
I wouldn't put it that way.
What way would you put it?
Just a manner of speaking.
Never mind.  I'm tired.  I'm going to take a nap.
Then I can't help you.
I'll be the judge of that.
I told you, 'watch it'.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
Well, they're mine now.
It's not necessary, Joe.  Drew's going to step aside --
'...Yes --'
And then --?
What the hell is this?  Who are you?
'Take me'...?  Where?
Bill.  Come on.  The question.  The question you've been asking yourself with increased regularity, at odd moments, panting through the extra game of handball, when you ran for the plane in Delhi, when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floor in the office this morning.  The question that is in the back of your throat, choking the blood to your brain, ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself --
Yeah.  Or the week after.
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Yes, I believe I do.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
You're only six-five once.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
What were you going to say?
So what's wrong with that?
Bravo.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for.  Drew's a good man.  I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
The fireworks are about to start.
Why?
I would.
Why?
Sense of humour went with the memory, huh? You know why you're still here, don't you?
I'm sorry... um... ?
Condition?
No, let's go.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
You did.
Interested in buying one?
You did explain, Lenny.
Who is he? What have you got me into?
Your wife?
What happened?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
Somebody's come. Already.
Calls himself Dodd.
Did you?
What's this all about?
What do you think I am?! I'm not gonna kill someone for money.
Well, that's me.
How do you know about me?
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
Did Teddy send you?
Don't be a prick. I'm not reading it to annoy you, I enjoy it. Just let me read, please.
Shut your mouth!
Mr Gammell?
No! Should I?
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Don't go back in there. There's a motel out of town. 
Why not?
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
You exposed him for what he was: a fraud.
Somehow, I'll know!
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
And...?
Trudy and I are goin' for Gina...
Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull?
Where's the new drop point...?
You can't.
Sure.
I got the item.
My end?
Make it 40%.
When?
I insist.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real.  Doesn't apply here.
That's right.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
No.
I know.  And now?
Sit.
What'd Neptune tell you?
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
I confess I have succumbed to my weaknesses.  An inability to see another's point of view.  I've discussed it with professionals.  Even with one of your friends.  She's here now...
Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...?
Nothing.
Havana, Cuba...?
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
We're makin' moves on each other.
And what does that level of spending on first-class, private- sector infrastructure signify to you?
And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea.  So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...?
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
...so there's <u>no</u> industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight?
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yeah.
...you are trying to reassure me because you know when people get anxious, they make mistakes. You're worried about me.  Do not be.  I am careful.  I am cool.  I got Trudy, backup, whatever.  You worry about you.  Because you are the ones who are in denied territory, not me.  If your focus is on me, you'll miss something coming at you.  That's how people slip up. Get hurt.  And I'd die if anything happened.  You worry about <u>you</u>. You and Sonny...are in the dangerous place.  I'm fine...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
But what does your intuition tell you...?
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is $6,000,000.  Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup.  For this kind of weight, the balance of 80% is when our buyer picks up the load.  Transactions are offshore.  Dollars or euros.  Secure internet transfers.  We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided...  No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil...  That's the deal.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
You work that out with La Senora.  You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say.  I'm sure you have friends with fast boats...
Lotta rich women back there...
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
I ain't sleepy.
For money.
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
You inviting shee-it.
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
You like it? Take a look.
Can he smell the difference, eh?
Yeah.
You know what's wrong with you? You got fevers. You kinky as a bedbug. How you gonna get to Florida?
You just -- just -- what happened, you just had a little rest stop wasn't on the schedule.
What?
You're wasting your time. There's nothing in there.
You bet I do, sir.
Uh, yessir.
Ready for hard work, son?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Two kilos.
You want to split your hernia again?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
There's two ways out I figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.
Billy?
Bad. She couldn't make the trip. You know Her boy...  Susan told us before we got your letter. She's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay?
The Hilton.
Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again ) How'd you lose your friends?
Stupid.
But just...
Just what?
Be tough on 'em.
Lucky girl.
Seven years...
We've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
Yeah.
What?  You gotta be joking.
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
Max - where?
Bad. Sent to the City Hospital. They ruptured his hernia again.
Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up.
You're right.
You're ayip!
Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right?
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
What's your name?
There's some weird shit here.
Mole people. This section was pretty popular, all the way to Fulton Street...
And a right.
The Department of Public Health...
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
Those things bring juice to the new stations.  You just can't rewire that shit...
What do you-?
Hurry, the woman needs help!
Scent glands.  Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Manny never threw the coupling switch!! We're goin' the wrong way!!!
I was just late.
Susan, we're not b-
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
How?!
The scent won't last...
That's why we should do it now.
Ah...
Just like Trump Tower, then.
Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. You didn't give me a chance to knock.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
You got a point there...
Following me?
I don't have a title yet.
I can live with "great."
Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines.
My pleasure.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
I'm...
Well, I hope you like it.
You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril.  How does tuna casserole sound for dinner?
I expect nothing less than your masterpiece.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
--cliff-hangers--
The what?
Oh, Paul. It would be an honor.
You really think so?
Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice.
Why would I want to leave? I like it here.
What?
Be my guest.
You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne.
Here it is.  Very first copy.
- right -  - don't go too far ahead of me now -
From her point of view or mine?
In the envelope in my pocket.  My right.. jacket..pocket..
How I usually find you, Nyah.
How do you that.
Yes.  We won't be able to have dinner tonight.  Something's come up.  I hope you don't mind.
Good.  Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof.
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Ninety-three point four million.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
What manic invents  disease like that in the first place?  Why would he do it?
Exactly where is she?
I see.  You're not just another pretty face..
Far right.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Well, Ethan Hunt, what is it you want to talk to me about?
Care to wait a decent interval?
Which is?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
I don't know that they 'pinched' it. Don't even know that they're blokes.
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Excuse me?
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
I do.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
..not in time to save him.
Yep.
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
I'm not waiting 48 hours.  When we're done at Biocyte, if she's not out of Ambrose's, I'm going in and getting her out.
'If?'  My, my, my...the five hundred people on Bruny Island that you deliberately infected with <i>Chimera</i> needed it as well.
By asking me.
You still don't get it, do you?  You want to make an omelet, you break a few eggs - <i>I needed to know just how bad the disease was</i> - in the real world, not the lab.  And you never know til you try.  You thought you were genetically splicing together strains of influenza to create a cure for all influenzas.  But I saw you creating a disease so terrible in <i>Chimera</i> that the cure would be priceless.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like.  If heís got that list, heís going to want to check it.  We should be looking for laptops.
What happened to Jim?
What happened to Jim?
What kind of help?
Bastard!
Okay...
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
I figured I'd let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
I gotta go in there and shut it down!
Bank?
Where exactly is it?
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Stairway, youíre wrapped, go to transport.
Allowing Max to see you and hear what you've got to say.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
No.  Abort.
Theyíre covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications.  Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
Tight security.  No guns.  Real plus.
You got it.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
I always check the batteries.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Bed.
Maybe.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Yeah.
What'd you do to your hair?
I got it done.
I'm wearing your bracelet.
Good morning, Lucy.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
I'm going to marry him.
He knew my husband who died.
No.
Why you talking to me?
I'm marrying your brother!
You don't get along with anybody!
I think that's it.
I know what I know.
That's right.
I'm freezing to death.
Right.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Maybe you're right.
Will you marry me?
What?
Yes?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
I must ask for that back.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
And we'll sell the house.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
Your hair's different.
Did you see it?
Oh.
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
That's incredible.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
It was a miracle!
She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor.
What do you do?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
I'm a little cold.
What would he be doing down there?
Did you dress her up like this?
Burn them.
Please!
How d'you do, good lady ... I am Arthur, King of the Britons ... can you tell me who lives in that castle?
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
NI!
We want ... a shrubbery!
What is that?
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Then you shall die.
'Tis but a scratch.
What!  Just a flesh wound. 
Had enough ... ?
You're a looney.
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
It is the rabbit.
... You silly sod.
Oh, very nice. King, eh!  I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food.  And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the social and economic differences in our society!  If there's EVER going to be any progress ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Right.  Arthur, King of the Britons, you're Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times ...
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Well, I'm really am most awfully sorry but I ... I can explain everything ...
Herbert.
Leaving the room ... yes.
Make sure he doesn't leave.
Look - I'm fine!
... I Bet you're gay.
They're doctors?
Well ... yes ...
You've come to rescue me?
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Look.  I'm warning you.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
But I'm the only one she trusts.
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Be careful who sees it.
I can't move to tidy.
Kitchen and lower house.
Yeah.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
A situation?
I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence.  The Tory Party has always been our party.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Aye, do.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
It can wait.  Anything else?
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
This is the top.
Then I envy yo.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
What does he know about the Highlands?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
Yes.  Yes it was.
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Of course.
No, indeed.
What is he doing there?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
Unwell?
No.  I shall be out walking.
Why is he not here?
Getting there.  It's more sensitive than a joy-stick.  Your video-character can respond as fast as you can.  But what can I do for you?
Sure.  Every game's got 'em.  I'll start with the schematics.  I can print these up if you want.
Why don't we take this into my office.
There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow...
I came from the city on the left.
Guess he took off...  You have his keys, right?
So how did it know my name, then?
You imagined it.
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
Then where do we go?!
What?
Dante's Inferno.
A way to hook this helmet into the game. I'm sure there are interfaces...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
I know.  It sucks.
You've got the schematics, check.
The keys are supposed to be at the end of each level.  Once we get all the keys, we can unlock ARCADE's heart. And then...
One of them, anyway...  Did you see it?  The Screamer?
Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't.
And then keep on driving?
Well, it's a long story...
Is that your question?
Yes...but...how did you...
Is it?  Why don't you see for your self?
I'm going home Cynthia.
What do you mean "you know"?
Will you meet with him?
I understand, Cynthia and thank you for the offer. I'll find a place. Now go ahead and give the Cowboy a yodel and get back to me.
There is no problem.
I'll speak to someone.
Sure want to thank ya for drivin' all the way up to see me from that Beverly Hills Hotel.
Well now, here's a man who wants to get right to it. Kinda anxious to get to it are ya?
How's that?
I don't know. All we do is take an impression of the credit card and until you check out it just sits in our files.
Well, Sir, I'm afraid they said you're overdrawn at your bank and your line of credit has been cancelled.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
Yes, there was.
Was anyone hurt?
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
But, this could be serious.
I don't know who I am.
What do you mean?
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Keep her from gettin' in trouble, that's all.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
No. Could be someone's missin' maybe.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Oh yeah.
Find out who they are?
Where at?
Making ends meet, huh.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
No...
Why should I ?
You're both embezzling. I saw the records.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
I'm listening.
At the subway station, we can get into a power duct that my little shit head of an assistant doesn't know about.
I'd say about thirty to forty minutes. Give or take a few.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Yeah, real cute. The storm is fake, but the lightening is real.
Great...
Well, surprise, surprise, I've been on the payroll for several years now. I still have an office and secretary. No one even batted an eyelash. Do you realize what the high turnover is in a multi corporation bank in New York ?
That's a shame.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Trust me, if you open any door, you'll be dead a whole lot sooner.
Either you'll be shot with bullets, impaled with a large spike, or nailed like a super model. Basically you're fucked any way you go.
Yeah, we're about a hundred an fifty feet below the subway stations. We're heading a little higher up now.
What ?
Yes, sir Mom. 
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Checking........
Fire the whole division.
We will start work on it now sir.
Perhaps it was. I was in boarding school for so many years, it's hard to remember. Do you have the tape of the latest exploits from my favorite hobby ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What if we were to put Bruce into the Park as a Guest ?
Yes, do you think he would like a raise and a new position ?
I was.
Aren't you the bitter one.
He'll never make it out of the park alive. I promise you that....
Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
The power went out in half the park.
Yes.
Thanks.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
My own sit down Star Wars arcade game. Wanna play it ?
Fine, fine, I feel like a chicken McNugget.
I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
What are you gonna do? Tell them that...a polite person helped carry your bag?
I would do it again in a minute.
What about giving the other guy a break.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Me, I'll know!
You kidding? he picks up a picture and shows Vada and Nick
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
Seriously.
Was it a nice funeral?
I already bought a ticket.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say &quot;Oh Dad&quot; and get on the damn plane already?
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
You are?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
oh.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
What can I do for you?
You're over reacting!
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
You are weird. Let's just go.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Give it to me!
Really?

Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
Bye.
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Is that a yes?
She'll be all right baby.
Excuse me?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Oh, sure okay.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Oh no.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,  Gimme the goddam keys.
Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your house today?
Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?
Yeah.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
No kidding?
It's no big deal.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her?
Is there enough room?
In ages, I know, me neither.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Then who's it for?
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
Why?
Sorry.
There were just too many of 'em.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill you in on today's women, since the last time you dated, something happened, &quot;The Sexual Revolution&quot;, now before that, you used to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no more no more, you wanna know what else is missing? BRAS!
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
For this class?
I wrote a poem too.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Oh, Vada...
That's Suzanne.  She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
We'd love to hear it.
Does he love her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Why?
My Dad was funny?
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
Come on sweetie.
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
What are they about?
No.
Hi.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
I think it should be outlawed.
Okay, get in to bed.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
If I do it, can we go?
Uh huh.
What's wrong with your eyes?
Where's your bike?
Yes.
Do you remember her?
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Pacifist!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
You can come to my house for dinner?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
Not true.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Okay, okay.
Part of being a New Yorker.
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
Manicure...
To belong to someone.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
Well, somet...
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
Never can tell.
It's more than that.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know...
A bad combination.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
Lower.
It's two weeks.
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
He said you told him.  It'd be safer with you.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
Is there food?
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
His Word.
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
The Hell he did. Look, I'll see you in the morning.
Sure thing. Put them here... I'll take them.
How in the world did he get shot?
Sure he will.
Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
She had on high heels?
You in music?
Oh, well, thanks. Ah, oh, maybe you know where...
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Fungus?
How do you know if they do?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Well, can you tell me why?
How long have you been with them?
Well, they removed my heart last week, but I'm doing fine except my nose fell off. Looks a little funny.
I don't know who you are.
Well...
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm not sure...
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Hundreds of times.
Not yet. Listen, Norman, I want...
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Depends on what I'm studying.
Why?
You do?
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
I know a couple.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Well, back in slave times they had a thing called the underground railroad. And we got a whole fan club out there just waiting to be conductors.  So, you kids out there, keep the faith. Cause Mickey and Mallory will be comin' to your town real soon.
Don't stop!
Ain't love grand.
She's in the holding cell, on this floor.
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Whose ratings were higher?
She doesn't talk?
All right, Mickey.
Tell me about the purity.
I'm sure we will.
Where's it parked?
Out front.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
Only on a much grander scale.
Just for fun, I guess.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Scotty?
Yeah. Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll.
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Well, basically, what we did was put part of the old show on first...
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
What are we talking about?
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
Yeah.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
See Duff. He's the money man.
Goddamnit, nigger - you must think you're white! Who d'you think you are - king of Harlem?
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
You a union man?
Used to be. On the railroad.
Then do like I said.  Men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  Well, how about it?
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Where was that?
Walker and Williams.
Looks like you're doin' a good job.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
No.
I get it.  Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
No, on the porch.
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
What about that girl?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
He could live with us.
Huh?
What about your boy?
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
What're you going to do?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
How 'bout the key?
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
No, thanks.
I said, she's in great shape.
I heard you! Now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
No thanks, Lee.
Going back, huh?
They'll run you out.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
It ain't in me.
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
'Oughta give up smoking, Jocko.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
What d'you know about women, Pop?
Let's stay here, Will.
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Right here.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
Nathan to HBT 1.  Negotiator is requesting more time.
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
No. Just Riviera trying to fuck with our heads. They're close. Very close.
An Artificial Intelligence. A computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. They're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
What would you say if I told you we could correct your neural damage?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Linked?
He's a Sense/Net Chairman. Why would he launch an A.I.?
What are you talking about?
I can access your memories, but I have my limitations. Hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
My problem, Mr. Case, is simply that I am a soulless bastard.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Steppin' razor a warrior. But this man...  ...This man stone crazy. Surely, the Mute is a false prophet. Our paths uncertain.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
What?
What about the A.I., Dix? Sense/Net hasn't even been able to trace it.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
How much time you got left?
Less than thirty minutes.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. I need my clip.
Almost two days.
The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
What the fuck... are you serious?
Too late?
Technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Give me five minutes.
You scared the shit out of me, man. You were dead for fifteen seconds. Totally flatlined.
What is it?
Laser fail-safe. You can't get the code wrong... it slags you. I can't let you try it.
Hold on.
Like what?
Oh I know.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Right. Right.
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
Anita!
Sometimes opposites attract.
Her dad sold a car to Leonardo Di Caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
Transitioned?
By Guy?
Five-- Six--
You've done five of my ideas.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
OUT!
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Hey. There.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
Little known fact.
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Thank you.
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Oh--yikes!
Why?
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Nah uh.
Who are you guys?
I'm handing out a free lei to every customer! What do you think?
Well, a ball player.
<i>                      I'm not the dumb one...</i>
No!
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Yeah, why?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
No!  I don't know - everything's all mixed up.  What difference does it make?  I'm in trouble here.  I need your help.
That's okay, I wanted to.
You don't have to.  You just have to believe in energy.
I'll get over it.
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
Now, there's an idea we can take off on.  Maybe we should drive out to the beach tonight and lay out a couple of blankets and...  Until I fall asleep.
I don't know - a sharp pain.
yeah, I had a bad night.
I'm not hungry.
Huh?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
How's your hand?
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Deal.  Thanks.
I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
A little basic, but nice.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Shit, that's what keeps people alive.
Nancy...
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Try me.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
What about Kristen?
And what are they?
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
Freddy.
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
I'll go straight to Carver if I have to.  He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
This is stupid.
I go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
Where...here?
I'm sorry?  You think you deserve the brownie?
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Oh, stop showing off.
I'm not listening.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Really, no.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
I forgot my bag.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
I was.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
I have thought about you.
Well, get a message through to him too.
No.  What's that?
Big feet -- large shoes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
Right.
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Excuse me?
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
And what would you say...
Well, don't over-do it.  I don't want people saying, 'There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
What's your name?
Miracles do happen.
Christ, what is going on in there?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
What?
Is Miss Scott staying here?
Hello, Anna.  Delighted to meet you.
Da Vinci?
How you doing?  I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Have you got a moment?
This is Henry James film?
I did.
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much.  Did you enjoy making 	that bit?
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
I suppose so.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No -- did you?
She's perfect, perfect.
No, sir.
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Right.  No one else?
Absolutely no idea.  Remembering one name's bad enough...
No -- you're right.
Three.
Fabulous.
But you have no proof.
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Yes, ma'am.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
A vote is before the group.
H-H-Hearts.
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
What did I see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can't laugh anymore.
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
What we're gonna have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'Kay!
Shhh...
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Fuck Miss Ratched!
Ca-na-da...
What for?
That okay. I'll take your marker. How many ya want?
It's your dirty roll, Cheswick.
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
So long, Freddy. Don't take any wooden nickles.
Does that mean we have to cut him loose?
My feet hurt...
Hell, I couldn't get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
Okay, Harding, you're on.
I know, goddammit! You don't have ta tell me that!
No!
What's he talkin' about?
Who told you that?
Poker!
I see.
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Arrested on an assault charge five times...
Doc, what can I tell ya?
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Shhh... Remember this is a privilege, so I don't want none of you goons fuckin' up. Kay?
I'm the next one.
You's better believe it, brother!
Yeah... Well, see ya around, Itsu.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Hit, you say? Well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. Whadaya know. So comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he's over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
Thank you, ma'am,
Take you han's offa me!
No way...
No, she wasn't my sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Buona notte.
No.
No.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Sa dov'e' lui?
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Smoking or non-smoking?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
My name's 
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
NO.
What?
What are you doing here?
The Sun Also Rises.  For Whom the Bell Tolls.  The Old Man and the--
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Well.  Congratulations.
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
There is no us.
Beautiful place...
Nothing.  Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
How about that guy at the bank?
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Is he married?
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
He's a podiatrist or something.
No.  He's never asked me.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
You don't have a passport.
What?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
We lost him?...
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
What's that supposed to mean?...
Polo.
Right.  My brother.
Oh my God.  Where?
Good luck.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
What if he doesn't like me?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
Uh huh.
What about Larry?
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
A porco?
Huh?
You said it differently then.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
Sure we keep records!
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this— a deal I sweated and bled for— on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?—
Maybe.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
Everybody knew him. He got around.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
I better get home.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em.  Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I don't know.
How do you like that one?
How do you like it?
No thanks... .
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Our Lord said just the opposite.
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
That—  —word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
He wanted to see me again.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Now don't give me a hard time.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
But you still hold out for silence?
Down to the wire?
What about it?
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Our identification.
Take it easy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute.  You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top ßoor the folks are usually out.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Oh me and my chum are just rolling in the stuff. We only work down here for a hobby, J.P. 
Boy, you must've been up early.
You was our first Supreme Commander, Terry. Keep out of sight and I'll tell him you're out.
Easy. Easy, boy.
Forty-five bills.
So-so, Johnny.
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this—  —to remember them by.
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
Listen, Johnny—
What do you mean?
Not that free.
A dime, Terry, a dime for a cup of coffee?
Thanks for nothing, you bum.
One little dime you don't need.  I know you— you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint—  –only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
You don't think he'd be— helpful?
One of these days.
If I could get my hands on you...
Where?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
You're talking nonsense.
...And I thought you loved me.
I would have time for my own pleasures!
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
Aaaaahhnnnhaaaaaannnhhh?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Without the snake, of course.
What're you talking about?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Tell me, how do you do that?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He ain't the problem, Jack.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
Sure looks that way.
Love is funny.
Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
It wasn't about getting laid.  I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
Whatta you wanna do?
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
What'd you talk about?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
And what happened to Carl?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character.  Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Yeah.
Another C.
Your homie, Glenn.  Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
I thought so, too.
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Is that right?
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
Faye Dunaway.
Shit...
That's my dad.
Really.  He has a cop's face.
And your gun.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
That's not what you were about to say.
You waved to me in the elevator.
I don't think we should get into that.
What about <i>my</i> motive?  Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal.  You think I will?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You know what I mean.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
How are you, Richard?
I'm not leaving Midge.
There were others.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
I remember you now.  Shit.
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
What's going on, Glenn?
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
It's a guy you know.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Me?
Hey, shit, come on.  I say I want this car, man, it's mine.  You go get yourself another one.  I say I'm in on Ripley?  I'm in, with or without <i>your</i> ass.  I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
You know your divisions.  You like the fights?  Like the rough stuff?  Yeah, I bet you do.  Like to get down and tussle a little bit?  Like me and Tuffy, before she got run over, we use to get down on the floor and tussle.  I say to her, "You a good dog, Tuffy, here's a treat for you."  And I give Tuffy what every dog love best.  You know what that is? A bone.  I can give you a bone, too, girl.
Thanks.
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
He's about to.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
I really gotta go.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Not at all.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley.  You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
That's right, just me.
Yeah, as soon as we got back.
Uh-huh.  You recall, did it say dead or alive?
Are they dead?
He was that good?
But...they called you Strange?  Because of Red Grange?  I don't get it.  Was Red Grange strange?
That's me, Sir.
You guys know her?!  I gotta have an intro!  Man, I'd like to --
You guys are new?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Some other time.  I don't feel like a party.
Waitress!  Four beers!
Fuck you.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
I'm out of fuel!
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
What's between you and her is between you and her.  But here's what's between you and me.  Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Yes you can.
You were more like brothers.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
Well...sure.
Of course I forgive you.  I know what you feel for Danny is real.  And your choice is your choice.
Brilliant, Admiral.
A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war.
Have the planes made it to China?
Well which of those three ya want fixed?
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
It's her 18th birthday, I want to show her off.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
Michael Fitzsimmons! Is he here?
Maybe they'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts.
Don't say that...
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Great, isn't it?
Right. I promised my mother.
Yeah I know.  But I don't have to flatter you.  It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me.  As in is, was and always will be.  I'm glad dancing was invented.  You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Charlie. About last nights..
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
Oh, God, Dion.
Are you for real?
Touchy, touchy!
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
I beg your pardon?
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
What a treat.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
All right. But this better be good.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Quiet today?
Please don't shout.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Oh. I forgot.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
For what?
Maddy's party.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
Why not? They're my favorite.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Your Mom and I loved each other, Geoff. Don't ever think that we didn't.
Right here, Mom...
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
You'll never find it in the dark.
What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint?
I said, don't worry about it.
That shit's saving your life, you asshole!
No.
He's upset, he's sorry.
Kids are great.
Continue.
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
They sabotaged me.
Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.
Rayisha. Very nice.
They didn't fire her?
Thank you.
Arline?
You're right.
Charles. Okay. Miller?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
Something like that.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
I guess it was 1984, 85.
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Thank you.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
How many do you know?
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Now that you mention it...
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
Yes, we did.
I felt, and still feel, nothing but the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria, who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own.
No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection.
You had one guy "like that?"
Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant.  It's an anti-trust action.
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
What whispers?
The ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that's more for winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
You scare me, Riddick. That's what you wanna hear, isn't it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?
You're not leaving. Not until we go back for the others.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
I would try for them.
It's starting....
Like the light is scalding it.
Not sure. Ten?
Hey, me. Over here.
We just keep him locked up forever?
Which means he went toward sunrise.
What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
Shut up.
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Well, don't ask me to.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Let's wait on the power cells.
Wait for what? Until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
You mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
What the hell's it matter?
Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
Just shut up, okay?
Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything to drink!
What, you're goin' off, too?
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Which half?
Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside from me?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Truth is, Riddick, I'm tired of this head-up shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
Hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. Thought we'd swing wide. Okay by you?
Just realized that, huh?
Like who, Mr. Chrislam?
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
The best. But we won't need them.
Just the same, I want one.
Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
What's so special about him?
Watch.  Hello, Bright Eyes. How's our throat today?
No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone. I've been there. I've seen it.
But what about your theory? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it.
Well, maybe they're not.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
That way.
That's because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has value.
I'll see.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
Okay.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
I know it's a man. And you know the rules. No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a leash.
At the very least, this man has the right to know whether there's a charge against him.
Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?
Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that the prisoner's story is false. But if he does not come from another planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang.  As an animal psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute.
You're a menace! A walking pestilence. I do know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone.  You have just six hours to make a full confession. After that I'll employ surgery to obtain one.  Guards!
Twelve hundred years ago.
No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
What evidence? No weapons were found in the cave.
Actually, you're a different breed. This creature will never evolve.
What?
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Tricky bitch, reason you gimme dat turkey loaf is nobody else can eat that shit 'cept me so don't start your game playing with me Junior.
Das right dude. You be tryin' to string de black man out on dat shit and keep him DOWN. Time's be coming, my man, when de black man's gonna throw off that yoke.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
They're scared? What about me! I'm sick of this shit man, I'm sick of this shit! They don't want us here! Who do you think they're fighting for! GET OUTTA THERE!
Yeah. How 'bout you?
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
You really think so... us?
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 
Maybe but I seen it happen at Ia Drang in '66, First Cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  Give me three men, if I'm wrong, I can still roll up that flank.
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
That's right. I don't want to hear about it 'cause to tell you the truth, I don't give a shit okay... I just don't give a shit anymore.
My name's Larry Mitchell. I live in Vancouver.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
How about taking to Uncle Larry into the old firm? He's a useful guy to have on your side.
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Immigration Officer?
I see.
As I said before...
No.  Are you really going to drink that stuff?
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
Sure... but somebody always does..
I don't.
There's a lot of night left to live through.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
Dance? Tonight?
I'm different. I like it fine.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
They know you here--know your name.
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
I run over to Victoria.  Play some golf with some people I know.  Do it all the time.  That's why I have a cabin cruiser.  Custom- built.Forty knots.  Mr Clark Brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  Member of six golf clubs.  Broke 70 once on the Shaughnessy Heights Course.  You have to be good to do that, And if you look out of a front window of the Empress Hotel in Victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on Mr. Brandon's boat, the Valkyrie.  Came alone?  Sure.  He always comes alone.  Mr Brandon's a rather lonely man.
Go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  Careful how you go, we're hitting the swell now.
Including Killaine.
What your father did doesn't condemn you.
So that I will never be found.
And that nasty man that followed us last night.  You didn't kill him.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
Who told you I was married?
You're a police officer. A very nice one--but you have a job to do. I'm a girl who's in a jam, and it's your job to keep me there. Don't go considerate on me. I might start to bawl.
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
We know everything.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
I don't.
Could we discuss that some other time?
A couple of hours.
That must hurt.
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
You asked me where it all came from.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I don't think you locked your door.
What do you want?
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
If you're asking my opinion, no. I'd read it to Greer over the phone. Ask him if he had any objections.
What do I get for it?
Sounds like a fair swap.  Let's take a look.
I'll know when I find it.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
Should be over there.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Do I know who lives down there?
You can find out.
No suicide.
And a motive--which we haven't got.  So this could all be a dream.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
Oh nothing.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
I don't understand.
Perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
I'll take your word.
The card says so, doesn't it?
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
Two.
With your charm? How could I help it? Have a nice trip?
Who's the girl?
As thoroughly as I could. It wasn't easy. But you are helping me.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
You know what would happen to you if I turned these over to the police?
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's the only pose I have left. I'm sunk. Broke. I don't even have my hotel bill.
You already have the checks, darling.
How about your new friend?
I say YES!
Well, I am a great admirer of your work.  I read your books on Chartism when I was still at school.  I'm a journalist, not a historian.  There are questions of method, and approach.  I wondered--
It's fine, thank you.
Don't be silly.  I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
I will, thanks.
Didn't Evelyn Waugh say that the country under Atlee seemed to be under enemy occupation?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Why, is there a new Foreign Secretary?  Who was the old one anyway?
I'll have some of that.
Like I was saying, the American angle in Suez is very important. I wouldn't want to say they let us down.  I think that's wrong.  A good ally is one who doesn't back you up in your mistakes, who tells you when to pull back.  And the Americans were good allies.  Simple as that.
And I didn't like that man.
My real father?  Well, he was a flashback.
And you're at this third stage
That must be rather nice, in a way.  I mean, you don't have any--
I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Did she talk about me?
Might?
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
I know.  I'm sorry.
On the torture of very small children, but don't start telling them about their rights--
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
It might have worked.  Really.  I would have been delighted for you if it had.  But she wasn't interested.  Not my fault.
I've known Susan for more than fifteen years.  James, we're old allies.
Thanks.
Why not sit down and wait?
Terrific.
Dad.
Oh she knows you're very busy, especially now, with everything going on...the doctor said to try her on solids, but she's been right off her food...You take this up to her.  Tell her you made it.  She'll like that.
We might be able to dig out a couple of Suez survivors for you.
Thanks for stepping in.
I've watched you once or twice.  You surf like it's some kind of street fight.  You jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  Always trying to win.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
So, who... uh, who packed my chute?
I'll take that as a yes.
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
But you're not alone.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
1322 last year in LA county.  Up 26 percent from the year before.
Not so far.
A little mushy!  You think the taxpayers would like it, Utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
What?  Now I'm working the drop car? Who's handling the scene here?
The lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
Surfers use it on their boards. They rub sand into it for traction.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
Angelo... I'm right this time.  We can still win this one.
This gonna take long?
Tomorrow, 6 AM.  Here.  If you're a minute late I'm gone.  And Stud... I didn't take you to raise.  I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Sure, he's "the Bodhisattva".
What?
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
I don't believe he did, Sir. I couldn't find a single track. Just doesn't make sense.
Who's our back-up on this?
They're getting better equipped every day.
Why us?
Bullshit. You're just like the rest of us.
We're not going.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
Hope to be?
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You're very right.  I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
What's that?
Sure.  For five bucks.
Sit-and-spin.  Alright... why not?
Not exactly.
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
You're joking.
Then let's go.  It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Fair enough.
And why do you say that?
They should be.  They're both good at it.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Did you buy some clothes?
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Ready to stomp sod?
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
You won't.
Huh?
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
What do you mean?
Right.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
I'll bring it back.
We just did.
Vivian's in sales.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
In Beverly Hills?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I pray for that.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
I leave extras, miss.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
I... Edward...
Of course.  Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
What if they serve soup?
But what if they serve soup?
Steak spoon! 
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I don't think it would fit you.
Excuse me?
I just might do that.
Till they kill you. Yeah.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
Brides often are, I'm told.
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
He knows I do not love him.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
What? -- go on --
Did you say, "I do"?
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
It's you.
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right.  The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
I don't mind so much.
The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate.
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
Yes.
Not yet.
Light him.
-- anything you want --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
Your first story was better.  Where's that bellows?  He probably owes you money, huh? Well, I'll ask him.
Okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
I don't swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
You never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Guess what.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
Roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
They come here.  They all come here. How do they find me?
Where?  What?
Why should they find out?  It's only two thousand dollars,  Bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  You can do it. You're an accountant.  The word 'count' is part of your title.
Oh, it's all right ... wha?
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Right.
Maybe you're happy.
Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work.
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Do you think he'll take the job?
What???
Shut up.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
It was the same thing in Germany. We looked for years before we found the right Hitler.
No.  We go. 
Very nice girl.
I can't take my eyes off you.  How can I drive when you drive me mad. Mad.
I shall count the minutes.
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Of Siegfried...
The Blue Max...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light.
We can't... we keep our money there!
Heil, baby!  I just finished the morning propaganda broadcasts.
Sit down. I don't want to trouble you, just want to ask...
No.
I'm not the police.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
I didn't lie to you. I just have trouble keeping track of... time.
You said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
What?
I don't know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
I live there. Alone.
Just for a moment. She might have picked up a hint you'd miss.
Must've needed it.
Of course not. Please.
Five hundred.
In the building ...  Mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the Patrolman.
He's lunching with the man who's buying the Harris Street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that's why he's late.  You getting a headache?
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
I hate tears. 
She'll need both of us.
It's been three.
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Contemplate your... panic button.
Where could he have gone?
No. I'm just procrastinating.  People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  Come on.
All right! Then call! At least, call!
She was willing to lick the stamps.
I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in...
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Bates.
Sam!
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I can come down next week.
No.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I'll lick the stamps.
Norman Bates.
I'm looking for a private island.
A son is a poor substitute for a lover. 
That's it. 
Then I'm free to go...?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Bates' Motel.  He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... Go on, Sam.
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
We'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco, but we don't like the look of that sky. Looks like a bad day coming... doesn't it.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Do what?
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
Don't tell him. I want to be the first to bring him the news.
[Perfectly friendly, my dear.] At last, I have really a secure living for us. We can travel or anything we choose.
Who are you? What is your name?
Who wants your money-- maybe I can help you.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Oh, no. It's my own idea. I'm in the business. In the fur business.
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
I'd like to have a look.
It won't do any good. They are a pair of would-be mur- deresses fighting it out.
Come on, we're wasting time.
What did it say?
Joseph is reading the diary, which arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place around him. An extract from the diary is shown.
I can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. She's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on Santa Claus and the other dummies. I've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
I won't let you say that!
Are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
I don't know what he was, but he made Frankenstein look like a lily!
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
Quick, Watson, the cookbook!
Nope, I'm through!
Now don't that call for an extra!
What!
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
What do you mean?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
I'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! I'll do it!
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
That's the one.
Why would I string y'? They were sweeties until a month ago.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
Here's a wow.
Gee, honey-bunch, I'm sorry -- I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Yes, sure, that's fine. While I'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick I ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail I ever drank. Anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if I did it.  Go on! Get out! I don't want to talk to you! 
No.  Why didn't I take her out somewhere? But she was laughing and seemed so happy.
All right, brother. Then you can go to some nice warm place, and I don't mean California.
Oh, is that what caused it?
You don't believe me. You think I'm just talking. Will you marry me?
Heaven knows. A lot.
She will undoubtedly keep her promise. If you'll grant me the privilege, I'd like to submit this work to the Royal Academy when I get back.
That is unfortunate.
I want the money back I've thrown into this rubbish heap.
He can't hear you.
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
Like now?
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
What?
Nobody.
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her.
Well, all right.
What is it, Rose?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
Actually, I am, though.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
But I don't know who they are.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Yeah, I'd believe it.
Okay.
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
How did the rabbits kill him?
Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you!
What's taking the rascal so long?
But how would you find him?
No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
Uhhh, gahdam stuff!
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Let me see!
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow?
Excuse me, I'll be right back.
I know. You loved her. So did I. It was an awful shock to me, too. An awful shock. Rose was so alive it's hard to believe.
Yes, we know her.
Well, well, well. So Miss Rosebud has arrived. Un-hmm. And you're all assembled here. Yes, indeed. Un hmmm.
What do you think of her, honey?
You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out.
The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
Boys? You say to me boys?
I don't intend to fire her, darlin'.
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly.
Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off.
Yes, sir.
Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you?
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Do you know what a friend you have got there? Do you know she would fight for you like a tiger, that she would fly to your defense in an instant with all the courage in her soul if anyone tried to hurt you? Is this any way to repay her trust and love? Are you ashamed as I am ashamed?  Don't cry, honey, don't cry. But let me warn you, damn your hide, this is Thermopylae and I am standing here. Do you hear me, damn you. I am standing at Thermopylae and the Persians shall not pass! Now get your tail out of here and go wash those dishes, and stop crying!
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
There are more on the other side.
Oh, shut up, Rose, eat your cornflakes!
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
Yes, sir.
All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look!
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
I was going to tell him.
What... what makes you think you can order me around?!
You think it's that good?
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Word is, while the vice cops on the East Coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into New York City.  And, right now it's making a cross-country journey to Hollywood, U.S.A.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
Filthy kids go to kindergarten too. What are you saying, anyhow?
What, am I supposed to read it while I drive?  Keep a grip on it, alright?
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
Clench your teeth.
Beats me.  You got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
No, but it should.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Whoops... don't mind me.  Go ahead and finish up.
You are such a disappointment, Benny.
Let me see that...  Not bad.
Yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  They couldn't go doing everything at once.
I can't believe I'm hearing this,
Nothing's broke.  Keep sewing.  And quit pacing, you big ox.  You're making me skittish.
Dead.
Your wish is my command.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
It's just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
Yeah.
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
Where am I?
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
I don't know.
Hold me.
Here's the terminal.
You love him, don't you?
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
We shall double our efforts.
Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down.
I know. Somehow...I've always known.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try.
I will not fight you, father.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny.
Ahhh - no - stop - I mean Janet.  Janet.
Janet.
I've one thing to say and that's Dammit, Janet. I love you.
Yes.
Yes.
Then ask the butler - or someone.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
My high is low. I'm dressed up With no place to go.
Oh.
The delivery boy.
But it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
By accident?
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
Don't want weak legs.
-- The legs.
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
I gotta go out for a while.
...Like you?
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Don't talk like that to him!
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
I suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting Green.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Don't like yours neither.
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
It's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of George Washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
That's it, I'm broke.
What about for food an' stuff?
Ya still light seventy.
...Fine.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
A few bucks.
Rocky.
No -- Just me.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Come July, twenty-five.
More like thirty.
...Who'd ya fight?
Ain't they?
When was they here?
How do you mean?
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Ya got a good mind for dates.
Please, kid.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Would you keep goin'?
He ain't losin' nothin'.
We're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- We board it ain't a animal shelter, Y'know... Adrian, I want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess. 
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
Let's get outta this stink.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Help what?
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
What gaps?
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
...People talk to me more.
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
Don't worry about me.  I can take it.
If I can find whoever wanted to kill Acme bad enough to get this.
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
Hey, pal, do I look like a stenographer?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
Not really.  Only a Toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
Boy, I'll say.  They gave you a real Toon-a-Roo.
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
Eddie, come on.
Jesus Christ... <u>that</u> was the Judge?
I Just thought I'd drop by and show you a photograph.
Yeah, but I enlarged this one.  Thought you might be interested.
Maybe.  Why?
Stop what?
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Don't do that!  I'm innocent I tell ya. The police'll just dip me.  They were waitin' for me when I got home last night.  I ran.
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
How do you know that?
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
A Toon?  Noooo.
Yeah, a Toon.  It was the guy who killed Bambi's mother.
How much is a shave and a haircut, Roger?
And I'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  Think you'll keep it?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
Do you bite your thumb at us? Sir.
No better?
Tempt not a desperate man!
Am I like Such a fellow?
By my head here come the Capulets.
But new struck cuz.
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Of love?
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
He shall be endured
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
Welcome.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
[Within] Juliet!
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
I have.
What?
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
You kiss by the book.
Ay me!
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
This is important.
You know it is.
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Not to me, you know that.
I didn't think to see you again tonight. You were pretty pissed.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
You sure about this?
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
There's a problem...
Shut up!
I think not.  After you...
What's that?
Now that is an interesting proposition.
A post office box.
I do, I do...
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Is that right?
You should learn a little patience.
No thanks.
And I suppose he's saying that we oughta give them something for using it, huh?
I asked if we could give him anything else.
Jujitsu.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
Christ, I smoke a pack-and-a-half a day, and I tell myself I could be worse.  It's just so damned pleasurable.
Like Larry or Swede.
I've wondered that myself.  None of this answers my question, though...  Why bring me?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
I saw you look off when Francois nodded his head.  I figured he wasn't pointing out a particularly rare shrub, and the rest was easy.
A lot of people died.
Not necessarily.  He could go off road at any number of places.  He might not even be in the country anymore.
But you can't.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Not exactly.
You see the bullet?
Clearly.
It's my job.
It's a cover, then.  A cover within a cover, a feint within a feint.  You work for the CIA, it's the only possible answer.
Very ugly.
You don't know?  Bullshit, you had her, there was no way out.
Right now?
Something like that.
Because I don't walk away.
No, I don't.
Finish the job...
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
It's the Irish tape we want.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
None of them had any --
I don't know what you're -
I knew you'd come through. Jesse observes the transaction Booth and Earl start to leave.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
Oh so God's like Western Union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
Maybe.  Who cares?
He saw everything!
What are you thinking?
That's not what I mean.
I don't want to hear about miracles and God and all that!  We tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
It's the right thing to do.
Man take it easy!  You're sweating like crazy!
Okay then.  I'll do it.
All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
I know, I know.  Dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  We'll pin it on him.  The DEA was driving Jesse's car. No car phone.  No radio.  They couldn't have called me in.
And you're solid on that?
My offer?  Well I'd say it's a fair one, like I said we're friends.  All I want is my share, which I guess is...
We're going to wait.  All of us, until everything dies down.
What for?
Has he?
I might have to look into that...
Nothing's wrong.
OK.  I love you.
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well.  It's over.
And I'd take it out on him.
Great...
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I love you.
We'll meet new people. You might have friends out there you never met.
Yeah, it is...
I don't believe it.
Yeah.
Hell, I don't know.  If I had some input I'd offer it up.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Well, unfortunately Denning's not here to tell us, but I would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
Well I don't know...
No, I can't say that I have.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Why?
So be here at three.
No.  Something wrong with you Dwayne?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Shut up!!!  Slut!!!
Then what the hell are you all about?
True, but neither is attempted murder. In fact I'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, Earl?
Just do it!  Meet me there, now.
Listen -
Well you can't have it.
Hi.
And what happened?
Well I don't know --
You've done without it long enough, ma.
Anything in it?
So...what's the good news?
You think he skipped town?
Hong Kong?  I'm not in Hong Kong.  I'm in Hollywood -- right at Sunset and Vine, two minutes from the station.  How about I pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
Did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I'm black?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
I'm up a hundred and fifty-grand. That's a Ferrari.  Do they sell those here in the gift shop?  Somebody cash me out!
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
All right, Kenny.  Thanks.  You're off the hook.  For now.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite.
So what's your story?
They think I'm a crooked customs agent.
I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Well, hurry up.
Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
This is a very dangerous man.
And you ain't black!
What the hell is going on here?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
I know.  I know.  I am sorry.
You said --
Who?
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!!
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
The same place you find all RichWhiteMen.  Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear.
Look at her.  Now, wake me in an hour, I'll take over.
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Take it!
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
She saved our lives.
See you in the next world.
I don't believe in reincarnation.  So I won't see you in the next world.
What's a Chinese heaven?
Fine by me.
I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box.
Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
Follow me my Asian brother.
I'll give it my best shot.
I did!
Yes I did.  I said MMMMMM!
Carter...
It's worth it to me.
No problem.
The Plaza Hotel?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
No.  But I'll help you.
Did you tell Sterling?
I'll take him.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
This is still Hong Kong.
Do I look like I'm movin'?!  What you're seeing here?  This is not movement. This is my "still".
Let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. You do it again, nobody, not Rhonda, not Yolanda, gonna save your ass.
Not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  You seemed as if you liked to talk.  I like to let people talk who like to talk.  It makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
Did you make the plate?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
Bullshit!  You were trying' to lose my ass again.
Stooly.
It happens.
Juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. There were never witnesses.
You know War?
Carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
The Feds?!
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
OK. Well...make us proud.  And be careful.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
It's okay. For restaurants.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
Not to me. Never to me.
What are you talking about?
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
I want to speak with my daughter!
Yes.
I do.
Thank you.
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
You've seen the post-its.  I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
Five hundred.
Done.
You afraid to try?
Still sweet.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
Bob will be very happy.
No.  You take it.
Of what?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
I already explained about that.
That's called changing your mind.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Ya think?
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
What happened at the luau?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Okay.
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
Maybe she hasn't read the paper...
What am I going to do with a microwave?
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
What?
About forever.
You couldn't.
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Yes.  Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
Whatever it is.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
What?
I love that dream.
So I mailed your letter.
I know.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Howard.
Walter and I are engaged!
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
Mom, we already...
You don't believe in signs.
Sure you do --
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
No.
Why not?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And you're worried about him.
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff.  It's like it makes him sadder.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
What kind of person would write to someone they heard on the radio?
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
You'll like it.
You think so?
Eighty dollars.
I don't think I have to now.
My feelings exactly.
P.  Dad?
Sure.  Looking good.
-- a slice of pizza --
I'm starting to notice that.
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
I know.  But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you.  And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
Now I'm late.  Bye.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
It's a sign.
Thanks for dinner.  I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
It's a short word.
This is not a joke.  Thank God Victoria doesn't know.  It would really have hurt her feelings.
Are you going with her?
Shut up.
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Yes, I do.  In fact, my firm has box seats for the Mariners. Why don't we all go next week?
Do you like it?
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Yes?
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Absolutely.  Right.
No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.
Whose side are you on anyway?
Now don't get excited, Mr. Alexander. They'll scatter like a covey of quail.
You haven't tried locking them up!
I don't make policy.
You know ...  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Yes. We will light the candles.
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
I did forget. Luís told me.
Because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win more than a few demands. We win...  ... something bigger. Hope. Hope for our kids. Juanito can't grow strong on milk alone.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Four nights. How did you sleep?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
This means they've given up trying to break the picket line.  Now we can all fight together -- all of us.
Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
You know I don't think that.
Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  I heard you ask your wife, "Who's that? His grandfather?"
Too bad. The men've always wanted to get a look at the President.  But you've come out here to settle the strike?
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
You think I was going to work you over? I wouldn't dirty my hands with you ...
Shhh.

Why not?
I can't leave.
You get off on abuse or something?
Because he'll kill me.
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
Nothing.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You really need to lighten up.
Who the fuck are you? Dr. Joyce Brothers?
What are you hiding, Danny?
Find a new job.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
I know it's not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
I know a guy.
Sorry.
See that?  That's just what I'm talking about.
Don't get carried away.
10%.  That's ...
Not tonight.
No. I'm good.
Was he the president?
What does that mean?
Understand what?
No shit?  Fuck it.  I'll send it to Oliver Stone then. He'll get them to reopen the bastard.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
But I just met you.
Garcetti thinks everything is shit. He doesn't even like dolphins.
Tell that to Bobby ... and his wife and kid.
After that ass-whipping you gave me?
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
Turns out he's connected.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
You mean the menacing red car?
I was talking about Miles.
Come on, where's your pioneer spirit?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
I wanted you to ask back there.  You know, before you got us lost.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Better than drugs.
Fourty-four, twenty one dead.
We got us a tent, forty-two feet across, eighteen feet at center, hundred-and-ten foldin' chairs. Circuit's eleven towns, covers all 'a Hasset County and most 'a Weller County.  I expect that upon completion of my military service I will be joinin' said ministry.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
Shut up, will you?
Jackson, how many times I got to tell you, you're from Tennessee.
I'd love to hear it.
Gives Wade the second shot.
Don't that get kind of expensive, Cap'n?
You know classical music?
If that's the way you feel, why don't we wait until it's up to a thousand.
Those guns are close.
What about the company?
Twenty minutes ago.  Miller Damn, I'll go see if I can find another one.  You get Reiben, Jackson and Wade, meet me at transport.
Hell of a mission.
Yep, hell of a mission.
Good news?
If we stayed, we could make a difference.
About to pour his sulfa.  Sees the wound.  Stops.  Knows it's fatal.
Oh, yeah?
You want me to take over?
I know.
I'll do my best.
But, that's my personal brand of stupidity, I feel kind of proprietary about it, if you do it again, you're busted.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
But, sir...
Where are you planning on putting Private Ryan, sir?
Never mind, don't worry, we'll pick up this kid, high-tail it back to division, everything'll work out fine.
Has anyone ever told you, you're officer material?
HERE THEY COME!
I coach the baseball team, too.
No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Struggling with a pair of Germans.
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
You want unpleasant?  Just wait, I can do much better than this.
Lingerie.
Get lost.
So you refuse to answer my questions?
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims.  I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
Hey, sis.
Yeah.
Hang in there, man.
See you tomorrow.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Wait a minute.
I can accept that.
And I want to turn the home over to the state.
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
I just had a phone call.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
I won?
No, listen to me.  You're the best in the country, don't you understand?  It's like a pyramid.  It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents.  And it's you.  So tell me something, where's the flaw in that?  There is no flaw.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Dad, I love him.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Honey, about what?
You think you know what this money is?
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
Don't say that, it's not good for you.  You're...
Hi.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
I'll go.
I'll go.
Goodbye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Wait, wait.  You told her about me?
Well... just meet her.
Oh.  I was putting the...
You're shaking.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
What?  This is a good level, isn't it?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
Yeah you do.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Your only mistake is that you didn't dump her first.  Diane Court is a showpony.  You need a stallion, my friend.  Walk with us and you walk tall.
What?
I'm totally and completely serious.
You mean like career?  Uh, I don't know.  I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career.  I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that.  So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future.  As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell.  Your training sticks  as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet.  I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
Very talented.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'.  Read that.
How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Hey.
Yeah.
How you doin', brother?
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
He is.
I didn't ask you about the list, I asked you your name.
Oskar, please -
I feel like an old-fashioned couple. It feels good.
It's a beautiful city.
Breslau?  I can't go to Breslau.  Not now.
He's important to my business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
You did, but you didn't.
My buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the Army.  But by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
Yeah, I can.
Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
What's the matter, everything all right at home?  Mila's okay?
Things are great, things are great.
Whoever.  They're the ones.  They'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
The contracts?  That's the easy part. Finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Thank you.
I'll admit it's a weakness.  I don't think he enjoys it.  All right, he does enjoy it, so what? What do you expect me to do about it?
I lost a day of production.  I lost a worker.  I expect to be compensated.
Would it do any good?
No.
The first two were stabbed without thought. The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
They've broken their pattern.
Broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. This is too much fun for one person.
I can't believe you're alone in that house.
Cici. Who's this?
You could start with an apology.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
Fair enough.
I think it's out of your control.
Yeah, how can we help? Do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
I find his work overwrought.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Just for you, Sid.
No, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
Not good.
What are we looking for?
Yeah, right.
That's not the way we play the game.
What if your life depended on it?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
No, wait...
Is Sid in therapy?
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle. Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see the Ghost Face coming at her again...knife raised.
I counted four.
Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
It's documented. Most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
We've set you each at a five dollar quota.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
Where you going?
No, the other one. The one who played his wife.
Good bye Ben.
There's more.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
Call me Mark, would you?  Cause I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.
Oh yeah, how?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?!
I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me!
Sid I want you to stay here! I'll be right back! I'm not gonna let them get Gale!
He wasn't superhuman Dewey. He wasn't superhuman at all.
Show him.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
Brace yourself, Gale, all of this is actually not About you.
You're not a detective.
Neither are you, Magnum P.I.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Do you want us to come with you?
But you know who she was.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Sure.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
That's funny.
Bitch.
Yeah.
Who's this.
What are you talking about?
Wait a second Sid. Don't you go jumping the gun. You haven't seen the best part.  With the aides of the computer revolution of y2kI've been able to steal your voice.  Ain't it cool? Listen to what the police are gonna find next to your lifeless, mutilated body.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
But you know my favorite name?
What?  What movie?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Yes.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
Sorry.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
No, it's not.
Yes, sir.
You sleep in THAT?
I'm going... I'm going.
You know that's not true.
You have to move on, Sid.
But you're right -- enough is enough. I can't wallow in the grief process forever and I can't keep lying to myself about who my mom was.
Everytime I get close to you I see my mom. I know it doesn't make sense.
Yeah... I think so.
Fuck you.
What number is this?
It happens. Take it easy.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Wait, wait, don't hang up.
Who is this?
What's that noise?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
I told you not to hang up on me.
Dial someone else, okay?
No-bored.
TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Afraid not.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
He's not a suspect, is he?
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
And my Dad? Any word on him?
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
It'll be out later this year.
Have you talked to Cotton?
Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Your front porch.
Who are you?
Twice.
You're such a little lap dog. He's got killer printed all over his forehead.
And what would be your motive?
Like you had one.
Yeah, okay... whatever.
Whatever. Just hurry.
He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night.
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
What am I? The beer wench?
There's nothing that says I have to work with him.  If Somerset wants out, "goodbye."  Give it to me.
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I have no understanding of this place anymore.
Yeah, that's true.
What?  What?
Where was the prostitute?  Where was she?
What the hell's going on?
Okay...
It's not too far away now.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
Oh, don't worry. You won't...
Innocent?  Is that supposed to be funny? Look at the people I killed.  An obese man, a disgusting man who could barely stand up... who if you saw him on the street, you'd point so your friends could mock him along with you.  Who if you saw him while you were eating, you wouldn't be able to finish  your meal.  After him I picked the lawyer.  And, you both must have been secretly thanking me for that one.  This was a man who dedicated his life to making money by lying with every breath he could muster... to keeping rapists and murderers on the streets.
And, why is that?
We would have gotten you eventually.
Shut up!
Since we're just starting out, I thought we could go to a bar... sit and talk for awhile.  After that, we'll...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Not here.
Then, why are we wasting our time?  This guy's heart's got to be roughly the size of a canned ham.  If this isn't a coronary, I don't know what is.
No.
But, why would there be so many pieces in his stomach if it were nothing?  It must have been intentional.
I read.  Remember reading?
Nothing.
Totally unrelated victims.
None.  Which I don't understand.  He had to get back out.
We're screwed.  He's fucking with us.
Bear with me.
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
It's not what you think it is.
"What sick, ridiculous, puppets we are, and what a gross, little stage we dance on. What fun we have, dancing and fucking, not a care in the world.  Not knowing that we are nothing.  We are not what was intended."
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You do your job...
Why don't you shut the fuck up for a while? You bitch and complain... if I thought like you, I would have slit my wrist already.
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
Wait!
There's no time to discuss it!
I'm sorry, I only...
I can't be a burden, especially now.  I know I'll get used to things.  I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks.  Upstate, it was a completely different environment.  I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I want to have children.  It's just...
When the patrolman came she was trying put his head back together.  She was crying too hard to say anything.
It was, I tell you!
...like a flower and is cut down... <U>Amen</U>!
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
They have done...nothing...They are my people...
These are my people...  Unnt-meah! Go! Go! <U>Please</U>!
You were born old...
Keefer!..Put this man under arrest!
Well, fust off...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
You all settled an' comfortable now?
What's the sense in it!
Over there!
It's what I'm countin' on.
Comancheros...
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
Don't go blamin' yourself...
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
That means Mister Futterman is dead, by golly.
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Me and the muse, of course.  How is your book coming along?
Hey, take your time.  You know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
So do I, believe me.
Maybe different.  I don't know, Ellen.
It's simply too dangerous here! But no, you always have to have it your way.
You're doing fine, aren't you?  I mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
How could I fail to notice that! - I have to go...
It's good.
Lady?
You have the last act?
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
Never!
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And yet you tell me you lie with women?
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
It's a comedy.
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
But nothing is happening.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
Romeo.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
Fifty shillings.  Pounds.
"Madam!"
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Luck be with you, Sam.  Sam…?
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
"She speaks.
Yes, I know. But he was always hanging around the house.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
Will Shakespeare!
Oh
Mr. Henslowe?
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You never spoke so well of him.
Orsino…good name
Write me well.
My lord.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
Your aunt?
Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
And her voice? Like lark song?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
What of her bosom?
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
A theatre poet?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
Will you shut up and play.
I haven't lost yet.
Juliet?
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
He couldn't get his car started.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
You're not eating.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Your friends.
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
I don't know anything about it.
Cover it?
But there's no --
Take another look at these two.
I don't know them.
What?
That's all?
Yes, thanks.
Good. Well, you've seen the flat?
Yes.
Really?
He's got a car?
Open it.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
And now you tell me.
No.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
He won't do anything for me, but for you --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Now you thought of that, not me.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
I see.
What?
That wasn't a question.
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Would you like to talk about it?
Who have you talked to?
It wasn't like that.
Here.
I'm not sure --
Which is why I'm trusting you with this account.
Yeah, here, I mean, where else?
You must be Juliet.
I'd be delighted.
No, but like all novelists, I'm in search of the self.
The first one was fine.
I mean, that's what it's like.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
Then what's the problem?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
Why?
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
She did?
I don't want to see you anymore.
I gotta talk to you.
I don't want to place you in any position --
You're looking great, baby.
What're you doing later?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Like what?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Well, are you? Are you queer?
Am I what?
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
I am not!
Oh fuck, Norman!
No, thanks.
Well, I do.
Do you? You still see him?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Yeah, baby...
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You were great.
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- sure.
-- oh I thought you were --
-- mmm --
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
Look about last night --
Well then what are you trying to do-
-- you know better...
-- how did you get here?
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Okay... thanks...
Okay!
What're you talking about?
We live together now.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
George.
About what?
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
When is that, George?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
Well that's something.
How?
That's all you've got to say?
I said you were a loser!
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
Thank you.
They're not?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Oh, hey...
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
Sit down.
I said sit down!
Oh Jesus Christ.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna hear about it.
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Well, I don't know.
Okay, thanks.
Oh yeah...
I mean, how did that happen?
No --
Wasn't sure it was you.
No.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
What's that?
Aren't you going to have one?
Why not?
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
George is great but I know what you mean.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- Yesss?
Didn't you have any panties on?
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
-- never mind.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Well... sure...
Of course not.
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
-- he'll never know the difference.
Oh that's no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- there's not much room --
That's fine --
Jill.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
Do you have children?
John...
Do you feel bad?
No, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Yes, Dad.
Chocolate it shall be.  Come on son.
Okay.
Don't worry, Mom.  I know all about cannabilism, I saw it on T.V.
Danny, come on over here.
Okay.  You behave yourself.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
No.
Do I have to?
Only about three months.  Eh we're from Vermont.  My husband was teaching school there.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Delbert Grady.
Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
Who?
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
For the moment, Mr. Grady.  Only for the moment.
There's nothing I look forward to with the greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
I did?
Good.
Sound good to you, Danny?
Pleased to meet you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Your money's no good here.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
It's about eleven thirty.
Oh I suppose I oughta try to do some writing first.
You mean just leave the hotel?
Wendy!
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Oh, it sure would be
Well...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
How're you getting on?
A new pair of panty hose. Is it enough?
Went shopping. Why?
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Yeah.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
Sure.
Marty, do you see your suspect?
I told you!
And what do you suggest I do about it, dear boy?
Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
LET THY SPIRIT
Were you tempted?
What?
What did who say?
Vince...
I am sorry for all my sins.  And yours.
Oh-huh.
Yes, Betty?
Right.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Chops?
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Were you wicked?
I knew that.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
What?
An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard.
Three years.  A rookie.
No, you don't understand -- I don't want to get out!  I want to get in?
We must... get you some experience.  We must... leave this place.
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
I don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  I wish I had a ruler.
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Your name?
What?
What? 
Your cigarette -- out.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Can do.
Yes.  Until breakfast.
That's tomorrow!  Don't you have any snacks?  Machines?
My what?
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Mary Clarence!
In English?
Good.  Mary Patrick, I need you in the office.  Mary Clarence, carry on.
Look, this isn't my kind of thing!  I wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! I don't do that! I'm a star!
What?
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
Then-you run.
It's a convent.  All you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
I think they'd understand.
That's not the point!  They need me!
I don't know.  There's only one way to be absolutely sure.
People throw stones.  They call me names.  I mean, really.
They open a window.
She's a broad!  Got it!  Just some broad!
And then we can ice her.  No nun, no evil eye.
She's praying.
We can't leave it up to the Feds!
All right.  It's a beginning.  Las Vegas, Nevada.
That was exciting!
A Benedictine.
Her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  Pull yourselves together.
Are you nuts?  She's not a nun.  It's Christy.  She's a babe!
He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection.  I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success.
Two days... ?  For murder?
What is that?
In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish.
When this cut was made, this person was already dead.  This is not Lady Van Tassel.
Does that look like an animal hanging?
A fine idea.
Chosen me?
My talisman.  It will, protect against the Horseman if I show a brave face.  But, I cannot run.  If I run in fear, it is worthless.
I know it.
The Western Woods.
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Tired.
I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel.
Small talk.
My suitor?
Are you so superstitious?
There is no such thing as magic.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.
And this gives worth to butchery?
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
I... I do not know.  I no longer know what I think or what I feel.
I apologize if I worried you.
Just... keep where you are.
I'm drawing bad blood from the wound.
The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now.
Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality?
I... I can't do this.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
May I see my mother?
I remember it real well. Cut them folks to pieces. His mama one of 'em.
Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
French-fried potaters.
Give me the big'uns.
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I figured that. Well you better be careful with that cripple in the back. You'll throw him out. Looks like you got a wagonful.
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He had of went nuts and did somethin'. They don't put you in there for just bein' a retard. They's retards all over the place that ain't in the nuthouse. Do you know, Frank?
Have a damn party! Call Morris and them and get the band together and just party our asses off. I'd like to show that fuckin' Karl to the guys. They'd get a kick out of that. Don't you know they would.
Don't tell me what to do.
Don't tell me what to do.
I'll be back in a little bit then.
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Well, I hate you, too. No I don't. I love your mama. Nobody understands what I go through. I'll leave. You bunch of freaks have fun. I'll call you tomorrow honey. I'm sorry. You can kiss my ass, really.  You ever hit me again you little bastard and I'll make you sorry your daddy ever squirted your little ass out.
I know Albert. We're friends.
I heard you was more than friends. I heard Dick Rivers caught y'all all bowed up and goin' at it in the same room with poor, little, old Mizz Ogletree and her dead as a doornail layed out on a gurney.
Karl Childers just in from the state facility. Make one of them gruntin' sounds Karl or whatever it is you do.  Oh well, Karl's a little retarded, he don't know what the hell I'm talkin' about. And to Vaughan who fucks a mortician in the rear entrance right in front of his clients. Now that takes balls. Our number one tune for the folks, boys. Kick it off Johnson!
You shut up you, fuckin' retard. Get your shit and get out of here.  That was a wake-up slap, Frank. Remember. Reality, like I said. Don't forget any bit of what I said to you and we'll be fine.
I aim to kill you with it.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
Childers.
I ain't no good at it. I just come by.
How did your mama die?
You don't need to know all of that. You're just a boy. You need to think about good thoughts while you're still a boy. They'll be plenty of time for the other.
Yeah, I remember you a-tellin' me that.
Were they bad people?
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I like the way you talk.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
You want to go with me?
Yeah.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
Naw.
Oh, jackin' off?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
It was fun, anyhow.
Karl, I ain't tryin' to say nothin' bad about you, but why don't you stop Doyle when he gets that away? You're older than him. You're strong, too. My daddy wouldn't let him do that to me and Mama.
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
I bet he don't. Karl likes me.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get your things.
You better go get 'em.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
Yes sir.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
I'll be dog.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
I believe you. I really do.
All right then.
How long have you been standing here?
I've heard it said that way.
Before that I was thinkin' it'd be good if I could get another three or four cans of that potted meat if you got any extry.
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
Can I help you, sir?
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
Yes sir.
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
Homicidal signs. Oh, we're gonna change the light in here for Karl. I hope you can see to write.
American literature. What else?
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
How'd you get started?
That's right. More than four thousand pictures of the same place. The corner of 3rd Street and Seventh Avenue at eight o'clock in the morning. Four thousand straight days in all kinds of weather.  That's why I can never take a vacation. I've got to be in my spot every morning. Every morning in the same spot at the same time.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
He's crazy.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Anything good?
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Okay.  So this is the story of how it happened.  Okay.  It was the summer of 'seventy-six, back when I first started working for Vinnie. The summer of the bicentennial.  A kid came in one morning and started stealing things from the store. He's standing by the rack of paperbacks near the front window stuffing skin magazines under his shirt. It was crowded around the counter just then, so I didn't see him at first....
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
Where to?
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
Bully for you.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
Yeah, I know. To that girl who moved to Pittsburgh.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Sure thing. See you later.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
I thought maybe he was pretending.
And these?
What can I do for you?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
It'll cost you five bucks.
Do you have eyes in your head, or are those brown things bulging out of your sockets just marbles? You've been sitting here all day, and how many cars have you seen drive up and ask for gas?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
How long have you been here?
And how long did I tell you you could stay?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
That's logical. And if you don't sleep, you don't need a bed. Saves you money, too.  So what's this story you're working on, anyway?
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Yeah, I picked it up.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
Keep up with that attitude, and you won't have a future.  Seventeen is a hell of an age to die. Is that what you want?
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
It wasn't my fault.
The water was dripping, see... I turned it off, but it was still dripping, and then Auggie had to go out, and so I left the back room ... And later on ... well, later on ... when Auggie came back ... the whole place was flooded. His Cuban cigars got all messed up ... You know, soaked through ... just when he was about to sell them ... to these rich guys in suits....
What are you talking about?  You can't be serious.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
None.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
A thousand.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
More than eager.  He was out to make a point.
Pretty darn clear.
But isn't the <u>truth</u> that there are <u>several</u> other ways to explain <u>each</u> of these twelve pieces.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
Carl Heine came.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Yes.
You're right.  I better use two.
Fell.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
I'll take two.  One for later.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Naw, I had that around for a while.
Maybe.
Does it now?
A little.  Yes.  You have to wonder.
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for <u>certain</u> which it was.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope.  Or could have been.
Whatever the latest jargon is.                                   MEKUM Much better, much higher.  For example, where your old ones expressed ninety percent of their sexual energy in aggressive physicality, these new ones are ninety-nine percent without sexual inclination.  It's <u>all</u> aggression.                                   SLOAN                          <u>Real</u> men!                                   CHURCH                          At ease, Lieutenant.                          What if they fought?     A sudden silence.     SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.     Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up. MEKUM You mean up there?                                   CHURCH                                             Go ahead, Rube.  Tell Todd to take him. MEKUM No!     They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new soldiers can't fight?                                   CHURCH                    "No"? MEKUM Not fair.  No contest.  Send two more of your old ones up.     Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a glance.                                   MEKUM Go ahead.
Why?
Get lost, will you?
Fresh!

Those two musicians from the garage!
Quiet - I'm thinking.
That's not far enough.  You don't know those guys!  But they know us.  Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us -
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This time I'm not going to let you talk me into something that...
Now you tore the other one.
Break it up, girls!  Daphne! Come on, help me!
You wouldn't hit a girl, would you?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we?  We're broke.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
This happens to me all the time in public.
You're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man?
Why do I let you talk me into these things? Why?
WHAT?
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
What engagement present?
Daphne got a proposal tonight.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
What are you giving me with the omelette?
But they're from Osgood.  He wanted me to wear them tonight.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
Terribly sorry.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
You got some?
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
What's the surprise?
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Vanity Fair?
You like it?
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
You invest in shows?
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Wanna bet?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
I'll throw up!
Who?
You're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
I forgive you.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
It's three weeks in Florida -
I'm not doing anything.  I just thought I'd go home and have some cold pizza -
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Where did he conduct?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Really?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
You don't know what they're like. You fall for them and you love 'em - you think it's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin - and the next thing you know they're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and betting on the horses -
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.
Glasses?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Saxophone player?
My fault.
You're not hurt, are you?
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
No, my flag steward.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
For your own amusement?
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
Tonight?
You collect shells?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
Shell Oil?
And you will come to hear us tonight?
Looks like they're on the wrong track.
Caught him off Cape Hatteras.
They shrink when they're marinated.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Nothing at all?
Not anymore.  I was in love once - but I'd rather not talk about it.  How about a little cold pheasant?
Talk about sad.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
I'll meet you on the pier again - right after the show.
Tomorrow night?
You're not?
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Smart move.  Oh, by the way - did you get my flowers? You know, those orchids from my greenhouse - the fog finally lifted over Long Island, and they flew them down this morning.
That's because I've been on the wagon.
Some people got no respect for the dead.
Big joke!
Why?
But I’m not taking your name, buster. I’m a feminist!  I need icey! Mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it’s--
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Lasik surgeon, actually.
And you do now?
No, tell me.
Hello, Katmandu.
I have regrets.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Kat.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
You stand on your tiptoes.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Shampoo, got it!
Oh, no.
What?
It’s my job.
Sure, but it’s never easy. They say they’re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they’re not.
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
I heard you were back in town, kitty cat. You’re here for the highland flings, I bet.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
Of course, don’t be silly.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Just drunk enough.
Hard.
Me and Sounder went to this prison camp to see my Daddy and the police guard runs us away and I fell on some glass.
That's where we come from first?
Colored.
What he talk 'bout?
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
She was dirty and wet...
No, Miss Johnson...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Where was you, Daddy?
No, no, I'm all right, son... This damn leg just won't act right no more!
Never heard of 'im. We gotta lotta men here...
Where did it come from, Mama?
You sure can, son...
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im.  The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Tell Rebecca I said 'hi', now...
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
But I saw you -- you looked in there, and you found out, Miss Boatwright.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
I shore could, Miss Rebecca.
Is there something I can do to help you?
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
Alright, now I want you to say 'horsefucker.'
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
I hate the environment.
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Yeah, but you know what? That whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. You can't do that.
Your behind?
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Eric, you're not watching your mouth!
How would like some Salisbury Steak with buttered noodles?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
No, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
What?
Doky maping she deeder!!!
Uhh...
Do as I say, Kyle!
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
Kyle, check it out.
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few times before...
Yeah...
You bastards!!
I thought you had something planned.
Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
He was killed doing something he saw in the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip... THEY killed Kenny.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
What the hell is going on?!
SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO ME!!!
The F word?!
This is NOT a place for fun and games! This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!! We at MAC have a trial to go to!
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
I sure did, Phillip!!
Hello, Brooke Shields!
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not too big to carry myself-
You don't care.
I DO respect your mind! It turns me on! It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of you! Don't you see?
I don't care!  I want to talk about it now!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Hi Stan.
Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice cream?
Wow, I have a clitoris too.
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm sure I will.
Ain't it the truth. Must be good to be rich.
Why, didn't they say?
Well that hotel begins construction in January, there's going to be a lot of shuttle work.
Nah, I already ate.  Why don't you just go down there?
Uh...
What is the condition of the bridge?
Well, preferably in tens and twenties...
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Over and out!
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
With what?  How am I going to interface with it?  I need to be able to talk to the system and to have the system talk to me.
Seen one like it before?
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
At this point I'm ready for anything.
Don't worry about what will happen, just concentrate on what is happening.  You'll live longer.
But how are you going to escape?
Hopefully sooner than later.
Sooner than later.
What do you mean?  What happened!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
It did.  It is.  There's nothing we can do about that.
Congratulations on your...recent award.
That is one of my priorities.
Where's Taylor?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Nope.
Can I get you something for the road?
I should've pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
We're looking for Buzz Fazeli, seen him?
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
Nothing going on here, everybody stand back. Let him through, ladies. Ladies, please. As they start to move through the female throng, a little girl pops out in front of them, holding her ball.
Kastle's daughter's been lookin' for you.
See ya 'round Faz.
Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Yeah, against that prick VanDeMark.
Who gave it to you?
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
The small ball.
Maybe I could bowl in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
You got a better offer?
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
Listen, if straight doesn't work out, you come work for me.  Just make sure nobody's following you. Buzz's face is eerily lit by the glow of the sunset, his halo bouncing in the breeze.
He's dead, isn't he.  Buzz Fazeli might just as well have died before you were born.
Cool!
It depends.
You shouldn't touch her.
No, Junior, you shouldn't touch her.
I don't want to play.
Someone wants to play with me?
I like the sport the way it is.
She ran away to be with that...  that Motocross champion.
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
I'm a bowler.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
You're here.
Too late for what, Sheila?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
He's my father.
It?
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Are you sure he's dead?
SSHHEEIILLAAA!
Who said anything about an ultimatum? You want to find your father? Get a shovel and start digging. Hurry up, he's probably in Purgatory by now. Sheila makes a pathetic attempt to speed away from Theo. He moves up beside her again.
I'm pissing you off? I'm doing what I said I'd do. What the hell are you doing? What about your word?
Fuck plan C!
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Basement bingo?
What are you gonna do, call the bowling police?
You call it stooling, we call it cooperating. Breeze looks under Theo's car.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
I can't...
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
What is it?
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
What was that?
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Press?  No, I haven't.
They didn't tell me anything.
Maybe older --
Just worry about yourself.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.
Then how can it be chipped?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that.
Sir, about leaving --
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
The timing has never seemed quite right.
Yeah.  Drowning.
No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.
My gosh, Norman.
What about you?  What happened to you?
They are or they aren't.  Which is it?
She was crushed.  Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
What are they?
In Edmunds' things.
Don't tell me to calm down!
You bastard.
You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me.
Fixing it.
The refridgerator.
The refridgerator.
1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.
Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
I don't know.
How can the sphere do that?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
Doesn't say.
Only lab rats.  Here.
Where are you?
In the sub.  Resetting the timer. Why?
Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
I promise --
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
C'mon --
Who says it's a he?
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Look, would you --
Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
Gimme another explanation.
Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight.
Then what, Norman?
Harry?
What happened to her?
When I woke up, nobody was here.
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Shut up and catch.
Well, press something!
Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it on.  Why are you laughing?  You don't even know what that means.
What does Norman already know?
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering.
Meaning it didn't land in the water.
Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From our future.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
Captain who?
Told me what?
What report?
I'm not sure.
How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus?
I don't know.
A million at least... If this robot has information related to the destruction of Organa Major, you'll be able to name the reward...
... and I want you to start cleaning the equipment out of the scan- shielded compartments.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
All of them altogether. You seem to have gotten yourself into a fine mess!  What happened?
My father told me many stories about you.  He said if I was ever in trouble, to come here... I need your help.
Not any more!
Could I learn to feel it?
He can't find Organa Major.
Yes, sir.
Send out a boarding party.  Full assault gear.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here... Just relax.
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
No, you're not.  What kind of talk is that...
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
I'm afraid we're not plugged in at the moment, sir.  We've had some problems.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
It's what I deserve.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Elegant proof of intelligence, isn't it ? We thought there might be a brain on P.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
I'm the guy who's gonna teach you to fly this crate.
Don't change the subject. Am I right ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
How do you feel about him now ?
Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
Good luck at the academy.
Yeah, sure, I guess.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
I try just to be happy I'm still alive.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
No, I think something's up. The Sky Marshall's here.
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
Yes, ma'am.
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Just throw me the ball, Diz.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
What ?
Hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I'm just supposed to take it, huh ? Well, I'm not gonna, and I guess that proves I just can't cut it.
I'm gonna need a squad leader.
I'm on it !
Teenagers !
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Looks like rain.
Good luck. It's not there anymore.
I want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
Move out.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Good for you. Go find out.
Who's that with you ?
V'ger travels to the third planet to find the Creator.
You infest and control Enterprise. V'ger believes carbon-units interfere with the Creator in the same manner.
You are what...?
Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth!  Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive.
Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately.
Mr Decker....
You asked my opinion, sir.
Captain... I'd like to go along...
This served the purpose.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
Welcome aboard, Lieutenant.
I stand corrected Mr. Decker.  Navigator, lay in a conic section flight path into the cloud center; bring us parallel to whatever we find in there...
Ten seconds....
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack.
Mr. Decker... ?
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
What answers?
No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger.
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
Annie...got an umbrella...?
I have one, but they lost it.
Other one has history, too.  I wrote my play on it.
You quit.
Well.  Everybody has reversals.  If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
Could you tell me when's the next train?
N'about ten minutes.  What was your movie about?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
But why the dalmation?
Yes...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
Mister White is...
You're still here.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
You got a paperclip?
I don't drink.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
You believe that?
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Yep.  N'it's for sale.  One of the few things money can buy.
Did as of last week.
And come to the printshop.  You know <u>why</u>...?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
Morning.
We had a date.
Wai...It's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  What did you say...?
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
They know what her tits look like.
And I need a drink.
You told me that about the <u>last</u> town.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
Now: I'm looking at the...
Well, get him something else and let's get out of here in one piece.  Get him a half of a 28-year old girl.
Look:  Okay.  Okay.  Look:  look you're driving, countryside, so on, you picked her up, she was hitch...
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
I...
Tell it with...
Alright.  Let's...  Page five, the fucking <u>horse</u> dies.  You know, <u>she</u> could be in the movie, she could, she's got a good face, she could be the Doctor's...uh, why does it have to be his, uh, <u>wife</u>...?  It could be his...
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
You have to what?
I, uh...  Um...
I'm only trying to...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Why?
Mornin, Chessy...how's the back...?
Doug, the traffic light...
You were in the car with Bob?
Moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, I have the Mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: I may own the studio when I get through with you: I got a civil suit, I got rape, I got collusion...
What the hell are <u>you</u> so down about?
Mmmm.  You have children?
You should.
A witness to what...?
The writer.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
Then, you <u>write</u> that.  And then this is <u>our</u> second chance.  That's why we're here...
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
Why?
To the contrary.  I want you to tell the truth.  The truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  You don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  And you have a fertile imagination.  Imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  If you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  Bob walks free.  As he should.  Joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  You know?  The people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. And they fear us.  Because we tell the truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  If we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  To our world.  Cause you are a part of that world, now.  You have to take off the Steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.  And be part of your world.  I got a five picture deal with the studio.  And you stick with me.  You write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  You are a part of this world. It's in your blood.  It's you.  You have to do the right thing:  we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  You have to stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the bottom line. You <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in the car.
I don't getcha.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
<u>Pay</u> her.
"Bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
Gimme Howie Gold.  Howie?  Thizz...I neee...I NEED EIGHT HUNDRED GRAND.  I...I don't care where it comes from...  It comes out of our end.  I...I need...JUST GET ME THE MONEY. I...JUST GET ME THE GODDAMN MONEY...Look:
Is that one hell of a kid?
There's no witnesses...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Waal, then, you know, you do whatever would make you happy.  Sher.  This is your party, and whatever...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
I read for that part.  Did pretty good too.
Zat true?
Givvem a cigarette...
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Excellent point.
That will never happen.
Like a big sister.
Maybe twenty.
Nothing sweetheart.
Yes.
Good.  That's very good.
He's badgering a witness.  Eat.
Now could she just...<u>forget</u> me!
You think this is funny?
...laughed, yeh.  They laughed real hard.
Not use my words, please!
In high school.
Don't take my picture!
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Dad!  You can talk him into anything!
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I have lava.
Rachel's job is she works.
Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid.
If you want me to hate her I will.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
Always.  Always.  And you won't hear a voice.  But in <u>here</u>.  You'll know.  What I'm saying.
I'm here.
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
Get out!
I don't recall inviting you.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
What?  And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Fine, forget it.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
Jackie?
How would you know <u>anything</u>?
I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>!
No.
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering <u>yours</u>.
Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you.
He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
It was a veal stock, I thi...
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Jesus.
They don't hate you --
No you don't.  And I'm not gonna screw with my kids heads right now --
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
And like, don't take this the wrong way...I mean, I'm cool...but...you know...I've got a good reputation at school and, well...I really don't want it ruined.
He's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
And thank you for dressing up for us. This is very classy. Tell us. What kind of professional plans do you have? What's in your future?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Do you have any brothers or sisters?
Maybe it's for the best…I mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrong…People who are bad should be killed. Don't you think so?
He wasn't.
For rape and murder.
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
We have to talk.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Yeah, well, Mikey, listen up. Cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
No.
I hate reading.
I dunno. See if I have any connections.
Toby Oxman.
Great!
Oh, yeah, well...um...I was just calling because, well, I was wondering if you still remembered me, which I guess you do...
Oh, that's too bad.
Oh, I don't remember that...
Three.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Is this to like get into Sundance?
200 verbal/710 math. Kinda weird, I know. But I think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
Let me tell you something Cooper! I never once bad-mouthed him during all those months--
I guess not Cooper...
I insist...
The transmission is an hour old...
Good.
Chemco is willing to deal with him, meet his demands.  I can have the money there in an hour.
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Captain it would be impossible to turn down such a gracious request.
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
What does that mean?
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
Mister President, are you going to let this stooge talk to you like this?
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
It's not a he, General.  It was an article in the "Times" about a year and a half ago.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Well, you can't do that because he's dead.
Sure...sure, Colonel.  Now look, I'm picking up the phone...nice and slow.  Right?...Hello? ...Hello?  Hello?...Hello?...Gee, it must be edad. Probably the lines were hit during the fighting.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
That's government property, Major.
Yes?
Thank you, sir.  But what shall I tell them to do if they are denied entrance?
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
No, sir.
Condition Red!
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
You're a good officer, Major, and you're perfectly right to bring these facts to my attention.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
You know the regulations well, Major.
And if that were true?
Just a squirt.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
No, sir.  I mean I didn't think you hadn't given it a lot of thought.
You see, Major, at this very moment, while we sit and chat, a decision is being made by the President in the War Room.  He knows that the enemy will pick up our planes on their radar in about twenty minutes.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
Then don't you realize the Bomb gives us Peace not War?  And, if that's the case, I ask you again: Why do they want disarmament?
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
Do you think they would cheat?
Why can't you cancel it?
Knock it off will you, General?  Crudley, find out what's holding up that call!
Well, sir, it looks like one aircraft, the "Leper Colony", failed to receive the recall.
Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Call them every five miles.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
I've got one.
What's your point, Lothar?
Check, all bomb circuits green.  Okay, Lothar.
Primary trigger switch.
What happened?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
Hell, he looks dead.
Quentin, how's your gear?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
A special committee would have to be appointed to study and recommend the criteria to be employed, but off-hand, I should say that in addition to the factors of youth, health, sexual fertility, intelligence, and a cross-section of necessary skills, it would be absolutely vital that our top government and military men be included, to impart the required principles of leadership and tradition.
I don't know.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
In Group?
It was pretty bad, huh?
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Yeah.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
You know? And it used to scare me so much that I didn't know what was coming in my life.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Needs some pizza in his diet.
Stuck, who? What guy? Huh?
Well, shit! Happy fucking birthday!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
A long, long, long...
In the limo!!!
No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Hey, man.
What?
Tim...
No.
Mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
Oh, you were there?
You could do it.
Yeah!
Hey, Gary, how's the divorce comin'?
Okay. We'll go for a ride.
Oh, me too. Middle-class.
Really?
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Always two-fifty, my friend.
Sooze wants to see him.
Good. That's good.
What?
What? What'd you do?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. She's unconscious?
You lied to me.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
Because I care, I'm a fucking fool?
No.
He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
Hey, Ma, look at me! Top of the world, Ma!
Yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
No.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
I'm talking about idealism.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Jeff. Jeff.
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
Of course.
New ground?
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
No, no.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
No, I just don't feel like it. That's all.
No, no, I have to talk to you.
To his hotel?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
Wow, man. The corner. I mean, nothing's changed.
Oh yeah, yeah, we're starting to get good placement and shit like that, you know.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Yeah. You should show 'em to me.
You know what I'm saying?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
That's because I am.
You do?
Oh, my god!
About what?
It's none of my business?
Oh, okay, it's none of my business. Yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
... my manager will slap an assault charge on your ass faster than you can say AA, okay?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
... I don't know.  Probably not.
Huh?  Oh Jesus...
What?!  But all our paperwork's there. My school records, Jack's football records...
We're here for you, Diane.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
Just call me later.  I gotta get some smokes for Grandma.
Okay.  How much ammo you reckon you'll need?
Or, I could get my own horse...
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
Action! The scene starts.
Hi, Artie.
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
Are you hungry?
You'll be waiting for me?
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Saddest thing I ever heard.
Twenty-two.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
If you love me, Joe.
What assistant?
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
December twenty-first.
Where do you live?
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Come here!
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Keep it.
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
This is the right day.
Good.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
He was trying to spare your feelings. The studio wanted to rent your car.
That's a lie!  They want me, they want me!  I get letters every day!
It will never make house Beautiful. I guess it's O.K. for one night.
Haven't got a thing.
No?
Was theft involved?  Did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
Thank you, Max.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
Am I? Still?
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
When can I see, you again ?
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e.
You don't like me? You hate me?
What do you feel about me?
It seemed that way to me.
Feelings are real. Once you've had them, they're yours forever.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
Just one kiss. For old times' sake.
Turn it against her.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
I don't want your help.
Well, Lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. Nice to meet you, Jimmy.
Oh, no thanks.
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
Can you create life?
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
I'm Linda Lee.
Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
I knew it!
Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
TUESDAY! I got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Brad.
Nope.  Never. 
The kid needs a man to show him --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
Ricky. My little boy. At least here we've got a house. and I've got a job. Okay, I'm only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. Except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  I even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
I mean him.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Well, this pate is rather...unusual.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
I'm sorry, Mr. White, but I've got an errand to run.
Thirty-five.
What about this week's check?
First paycheck?
They're just . . . floating around out there. The computer knows where.
One.  And a half.
Mr. Gorman, just answer me one question...
Uh...
Black or regular?
Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
Turn on the T.V.
I did. isn't it neat-o?
You designed it?
What will it do?
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
We gonna crash?
No...I just have a little stop to make.
A photographer eats with his camera, A Photographer sleeps with his camera --
What about you?
You! You're lucky I didn't fire you. I get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? A broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
But the other night...
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Today coffee----
We already have a super-tanker.
A normal person.
Like fish he is.  I know enough about computers to put a PHD to shame.  Come now, brother dear, you didn't think I was going to let that little man run the show, did you? Gus Gorman telling us what to do -- I'd sooner kiss a pig!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Never closed my eyes.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Everything on it.
Does she know about it? She's in it!
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A parka.
North!
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
Is this a philosophy seminar? No. This is getaway.
It's beautiful.
I think he said a "curl."
Superman's got something up his sleeve, that's for sure. We just haven't figured it out. Isn't that right, Miss Lane?
We have all of this without you. You cannot bargain with what you don't have.
The son of Jor-El on this Planet?
Kill me? Lex Luthor? Extinguish the greatest criminal flame of our age? Eradicate the only man on earth . . .
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
DELETE IN CUTTING 		) There . . .  A place called . . . Houston . . .
Brave young heroes. Be nice to them, my dear. Blow them a kiss.
Yes?
I really don't think . . .
Gosh, I'm sorry, we better get in line.
What about here?
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
No mind, it's only antique Irish linen.
You don't have to be polite, Clark. I've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
You always overreact, Clark. How terrible can it be?
I'm sorry.
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I'll try. . .
Go on . . .
Good. If you can see it, and I can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
Clark Kent! You socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
Daddy . . . ?
. . . And  very naïve!
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Get the box, nephew.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
What do you fear?
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
Bunkers!
What's she doing in California?
I know.
Oh, for God's sake!
You described the exact contents of my purse.
Don't you ever give up?
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
They will once I hang it on him in tomorrow's edition.
He wants to see you. Lex Luthor.
My father always said to me, 'Son, don't invest your money in anything but land. Land! Stocks rise and fall, banks fall, people are no damn good, but they'll always need land and for that they'll pay through the nose. 'Remember that ,' my father said. 'Land."
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
I read the article.
See? I see. It's you who don't see. Doesn't see. I cannot believe it! How you people fail to grasp the long-range significance of this! Y'know?
Bingo!
No, you're going to get kissed,
We just take it?
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
What are you going to do to him?
Tea?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
an Ode to Spring. are there one or two "T's" in bloodletting?
On the salary he pays me, I can't make my rent without it.
Folks'll ask question.
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
There are none of them any good anyway.
Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
You think they're strange?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Where do you hail from?
No speeches, Otis. Just watch what Albert has prepared.  What are you waiting for?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
It is for me.
Which one?
Yes.  Do you find there's something strange about this meat?
I will.
I'll tell her that.
Mister, I don't want to know your name.
Why are you telling me this?
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
That's because he misses you.
They can look forward to that.
Good night.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Because I have to.
Well I don't.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
No.  I saw it on his face.
Yes.  Like I was putting them into my big basket.  Clearing the hillside of its children.
With our hands.
I feel like a princess.
It's the truth.
What's a ditty again?
Nicole?
Oh.
Yes.  Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
So you can keep on getting well before you have to go and do this. It's not going to be easy, Nicole. Do you understand that?
Thank you, Nicole.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Tell me about it.
Perfect.
You always think you know what I'm going to say, don't you?  You always think you're two steps ahead of me. The lawyer.
I need money.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
What is it?
Yes.
Well, let's see what we get.
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
Excuse me?
No.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
You remember this?
Really?
You mean it?
Of course.
What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
How will he do that?
Nothing.
Nicole, tomorrow Mr. Stephens wants you to make your deposition at the courthouse.  I thought I'd take you over.
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
Will the police do anything to her?
Yeah, right.
But Charlene...
Hitler!
That's the horse!  Shotgun - Shotgun in the fifth!
Yeah, having supper with the Mrs. She's over there.
Thanks, I see him...
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
...excited with good reason, I wanted to say.  Because this endangers the future of the whole quintet...
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
Robard's my client.  I did it for him and his club, not your boys.
You told him that?
Then what are you doing here?  Go over there and fight!  If Van Cleve fires your boy, it gives a lie the ring of truth!
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Right now you're in no position to ask questions!  And your snide remarks---
May I lift my eyebrows?  What is this?  What are you trying to do?
Yes, he phoned.  I don't know this boy too well.  Anything in these charges?
J.J., Steve isn't...
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I'll listen one more minute.
No, lemme finish.  I DON'T LIKE THIS JOB!  That boy is dumb only on matinee days - otherwise he's got a head.  And Susan, like you said, she's growing up.  Two heads. What I mean, we got a slippery, dangerous problem here!
Ha!  My right hand hasn't seen my left hand for thirty years!
When?
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
I think you loused this up but good. If I can trust my eyes, and I think I can, Susie knows all about your dirty work.
What does that mean - integrity?
She knows now.
Can you be there by two-thirty?
This sort of thing!
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
The renting agent and the tailor.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
If you want me to -
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Why did you call me?
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
Let me try mine.
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
No way!
This in intense.  Get a grip, John.  Okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... I figured that part out for myself.  So what's the deal?
Anything it samples by physical contact.
Why?
Cool.
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
No problemo.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
No, no no!!  It'll be okay.  Stay with us!
I order you not to!
No!  Don't kill him!
Mom, Mom, we need to be more constructive here. I don't see this as a gender-related issue.  She's still tense.  We still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  Right?
I know!
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
Relax now, Sarah --
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
Not yet.
Furtwängler's in a different category.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
I have a duty.
Then you're going to kill me.
You tell him nothing, Emmi. If he calls again, you say you know nothing. We're gonna keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. And, God help me, with Beethoven.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I don't buy that.
Sure.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
It would be truer to say, I think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Certainly not, but I knew he had informers everywhere. Even in my orchestra there was someone
I don't have to think carefully. This is utterly ridiculous.
We never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. We always performed as a private ensemble. As I think I already told you, I was a freelance conductor.
He said, 'Don't mind him. His job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
Now, that young conductor what's his name?  That miracle kid, you know who I mean. Von Karajan! But you called him something else. C'mon. What did you call von Karajan?
Yes, that's what happened.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
Helmuth.
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
Don't worry, Helmuth, it'll be our secret.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
I don't know what you mean, Major.
When you got to the crescendo.
Conscientious, determined, dogged.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Can you handle it?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
Don't wear the beige one.
That's none of your business.
Aha!  Is she young?
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
And you're from the future too?
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
Forget it?  Are you crazy? Let me see it.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
Molecular-memory.
Reese.  Think it through. We can prevent the war. Nobody else is gonna do it. If we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  We have to so it ourselves.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
I didn't build the fucking thing.
Surrounded by living tissue.
Six shots at less than ten feet.  Weapon was a large caliber--
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Clean out your locker.
Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
A game?
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
I don't understand why they're getting you involved.
How do you know that's the way?
Never mind.
They'll love that.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Okay... okay...  I put it down.  Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door.  He's an actor...
Stop it!
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia.  I'm just a walk-on this time though.  Bit-part.
Like... where are you from?
Big family... small?
No.
They'll be wanting it back.
Divorced.  Remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in Sausalito.
I redecorated.  What about you?
No.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Okay.
I'm going to call.
Yeah, almost...
You dodged a bullet.
Slow down, take a breath...
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Really?
I'm sorry, Christ, I'm sorry!  How many more times do I have to say I'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
Split it?
I don't speak Spanish.  All I need is to get back... just enough for that.
Yes.
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
Of course you can have it if you need it.  Can I get you something to eat?
It would mean a lot to me... if you and I could be friends.  If I could have you back in my life... in some small way.  It would be important.
Happy Birthday, Nicholas.
I know.
What kind of vacation?
May I make two suggestions... ?
First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  Second, you don't have to decide today.  Take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  One day, the game begins.  You either love it or hate it.  Decide then.  We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  That was my sales pitch.
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
Physical?
Tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, I'm threatening to blow the whistle.
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
Where'd you pick up your checks?
First they try to kill me, now you?  Put your damn clothes back on.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
No, thank you.  Goodnight.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
There's been a break in.  Lock this door and stay here.  Don't move a muscle.
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
I'll send your regrets.  Honestly, why must I even bother?
Cancel lunch.  Make reservations at Campton Place for me and Mr. Butts.
Why are you following me?
Follow me.
You're joking.
Sam...  Thank you.
Sure.
Do we still get paid for the week?
Nah, you're going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it's worse than a nightmare. --
Yeah.
You want company?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
She needed a job, Malcolm.  And she's smart.  And she helps me.
It was very specific.
Sure.
Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  Because that's where their bones are!  He killed <i>hundreds</i>.  He took them here and he killed them.  Their bones are in the fireplace!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Why?
Why would we --
You're okay.
Maybe you did it yourself.
Red.  What else?
I don't know, you know...
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Is it possible that you're too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
I'm not.
Who?
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
We think?
Why not?
Where do we go?
What kind?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Huh?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth.
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him.
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met.
<u>Valets</u>.  They park cars.  He's having a party.
You goin' back inside?
Again?
Uh-huh.
Last time I saw you, weren't you up for some equity-waiver thing?
How d'you mean?
I was skint -- didn't have no money to get here.
What was that, then?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
Various enterprises, style of thing.
Right.
Why not.
Oh, I was gonna say ...
Who remembers.
Just now?  Overnight?
Yeah, well, you're here now --  -- where <u>h</u>urricanes <u>h</u>ardly ever <u>h</u>appen.
Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO.
How far?
Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell?
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Sorry.  Wasn't me.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
I got half.
The forever kind.
The L.A.P.D.
What's in it?
How we gonna get that lucky?
Since when?
You know I don't live with him.
Go now.
Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
Be seein' you.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Hello, Tony.
Just see him, as a favor to me.
Look, I'm no expert, but--
Birdy--
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Huh.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
No. I might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
Sure.
Way out of line.
Mm.
Uh-huh.
Mm.
...Huh?
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
I, uh...
Mm.
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Sure, Walter. Thanks.
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
You don't got a headache?
Uh-huh.
Huh? No.
You also have an interest in the securing property?
Uh... you're under arrest.
As soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. Does he understand that? We're supposed to tell him. Are you conscious?
He said OK. Is that what he said?
I'm in.
Let's go!
Just a minute.  I'm shaking!  Take the gun.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Vince D'Agosta.  Am I out?
Not at all.  I enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
I believed them.
Oh.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Dr. Green has to see you!
Not so loud.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
You're right.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
It's one of the fire doors.  Good Lord, Margo.  We're trapped!
I wouldn't be so sure.
"Dear Louis, Tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we'll be in the greatest danger, so I'm sending Carlos back with the crates.  You always believed in me, Louis, even in the darkest days.  So it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  We've made an incredible find.  I enclose a representation of Mbwun.  Note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. It's beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  I know because I've seen the beast."
He's right.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
Another storage room.
It's not mammalian, that's for sure. I think it's reptilian.
So what?
Not today.  Besides, I think the director of the museum is expecting you.
Maybe not.
You loved him.
I ran an internet search on Dr. Whittlesley.  Got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the Times.  I also found a record of your restraining order.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
But this isn't the jungle!  This is New York.  How did it get here?  A thing like that crossed two continents.  It makes no sense!
Unlock one of the other storage rooms.  We're going upstairs.  We'll leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
The answer's right in front of us.
Listen to me, Pendergast.  Mbwun's DNA is part homo sapien.  In primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  If you get a clean shot, there's only one place you can kill it.  Shoot it in the eye!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I can't!
I'm sorry, er...the biggest one.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Why wouldn't I?
--a dead one at that.
That and a fat, new contract.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Of course, Truman has always been very much in on casting.
Istanbul, Turkey, you're on with master videographer, Christof.
Let me demonstrate some examples.
In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Sure she would.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
If we don't go now, it won't happen.
Nursery?
<i>Spare room</i> - I can start thinking about selling up...and I'll be gone.  Up and away on that big steel bird.  I'm going, don't you worry about that.
There's no point in trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening - elevators that don't go anywhere, people talking about me on the radio, you know what I mean?
Who?
Really?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Truman, you're gonna be late!
I won't be late.
--We could bum around the world for a year on that.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
That can wait.  I want to get away.  See some of the world.  Explore.
I know.
How do you know?
Your mother called.  You shouldn't upset her like that.
I made macaroni.
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
You're the one talking to the walls!
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him, it was his twin.  Did Dad have a brother?
Sure.  Okay.  Fine.  Can you pass on a message?
I don't understand.
Yeah.
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
That the bombing in Dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them wouldn't have to be explained --
Agent Mulder.
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
And if it's unsuccessful?
What's that?
Yeah, I had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
Have you examined them?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
What's the question nobody's asking? Why that building? Why not the Federal Building?
You mean that apocalyptic trash you write? I knew your name was familiar. I just didn't know why.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
A plague?
And why do you think it is you're standing here talking to me? These people don't make mistakes, Agent Mulder.
What's wrong, Scully?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
They were the ones that put us together.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
Evidence of a massive infection.
I wasn't planning on it. Particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. But I got a better look at the blood and tissue samples I took from the firemen.
We've got two choices. One of them is wrong.
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Yeah, well they may this one.
I have no idea.
Where are we?
On whose orders?
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
I have answers for you.
I think of it as an agreement. A word your father liked to use.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have.
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
Driver.
How?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
No.
What then?
Okay, okay...
Little boy?!  That's him!
Absolutely.  Abigail...
Yes.
No.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
I don't have to.
Sit down.
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
His own doctor?
The police. They're searching my room. Sie mussen doch wissen.
Dr. Winkel.
Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Oh, it's very difficult. You know Harry...we didn't do...
It's all right.
Have you?
How did you know I would be here?
You send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
I helped Harry fix her papers, Mr. Martins...
That's the reason.
He works in a military hospital.
If you help me, I am prepared to help you. ANNA Martins always said you were a fool...
Austrians aren't allowed in your hotel. Couldn't we meet at the Mozart cafe?
Just around the corner.
Yes.
Ever seen one?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
I can't. He disappeared...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
I see.
We'll never get him in the Russian zone.
Oh, there you are. Come in here, there isn't much time.
I said you win.
Yes, Cultural re-education Section Propaganda. Very important in a place like this. We do a little show each week. Last week we did "Hamlet" and the week before we had something...
Listen, Mr. Martins, if you'd agree to be our guest, we'd be delighted to have you.
It is, and I'm gunning just the same way for your Major Callaghan.
What about?
She's been arrested.
You can get somebody else...
What did he say?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the name of this girl?
Why didn't they bring him in the house?
Conscious? Cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
Suppose I take...
Well make it your business.
Two double whiskeys. Was wunschen sie?
Not necessarily.
Not when I get interested.
I thought he'd be here to meet me.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Thanks.
You go to Patpong? See smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
We moved rooms because of him.
One or two kilometers.
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
So how many miles do you think it is?
What happened?
He said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
It was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
You can swim?
I hope our noise did not keep you awake.
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Nazis did everything the führer told them. You do everything the Torah tells you. Or the rebbe. Identical slave mentality.
He's an asshole.
That's a movie, you moron.
I don't, but...
Fire...
Why the fuck not?
Too difficult?
Are they still together?
Is he a Nazi?
Killing himself.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Bigger and better.
Oh, yeah... 
You can't curse in front of it either.
They don't put them in the Torah. I'll get you a chumash, they'll have them there...Bet...Gimel...Dalid...Hay...  How come you're here instead of with Curtis? Besides the Hebrew lessons...
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
Fuck that.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
You want a punch in the mouth?
Really, which one? I bet it was the guy with the Prada shoes.
They're liars and cowards.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting.
What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why?
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Those aren't Jews.
Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he "universalizes" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength....  Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end...
Listen to me....
What were you, following me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
Get the fuck away from me.
But I wasn't.
The truth doesn't mean anything to you, does it?
Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should --
I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Who told you that?
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm sorry, Danny. It won't happen again. I'm going to use a brand-new power cell. Plus we'll have a back-up timer.
I have an idea....
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
Get out of my way.
I was a Jew in a previous life.
What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son?
What do you think you should have done?
...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
Dennis Leary.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
We think you'd be good at it.
And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that --
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I don't have the strength to fight off la Mamma... Anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Italian is practically the same thing.
Yes.  Of course.  Very wise.
Yes.
Enzo Molinari.
Have you known him long?
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Don't.
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
That idiot!
Have the car painted.
He's training.
... What's your name again?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
It's okay.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
... Everything.
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
So what!?  His job is to hand out the paychecks.  And he does that very well, let me tell you.
I don't want to erase anything.
... Yes.
No... in the hut.
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
... The way she moves.
How do you know that?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
It's me... Johana.
Then, tell me a story.
Why?
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Where I saw the mermaids?!  Why don't you ever ask any question? I'm always the one asking the question!  We're sitting here like two stones and I'm taking to myself. Ask me something, Goddamnit!
Johana... New York.
No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Well... here.
In my apartment?
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
You called the police?
Of course, that's what they're for.
His mother's an American.  He spent half of his life in the states. I'd try English if I were you.
You've made me a happy insurance person.
A settlement completely demolished, ten smashed army jeeps, four dead Arabs. G dash D damn it, Hammer! You think you're above the Ten Commandments? Just find Santa Claus and bring him back to us. No heroics, got it?
What's up?
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
My Esther! Oh Mordechai.
He's...he's very nice.  But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me.
Well, I couldn't be happier for the both of you.
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days...
Sure. Why not.
I can see. And you also brought a nice girl to come eat by us.
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant.
Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples.
I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir.
No dipshit, I want you to kill him.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
They all say the cat killed this second girl.
But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
You found the leopard!
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
I want to ask you something.
I can understand about the cat killing the first girl. Charlie How Come told me. All that noise and those lights -- scared crazy it would do anything. Last night there was nothing to disturb it. Just a little girl alone in a cemetery.
Some crazy guy.
Yes, but what sort of a man?
Thanks.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Yes. And I am taking it to headquarters for examination.
And did you find the leopard?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
And not a sign of the leopard?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I work here, sir. I’m here most of the time.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Can it be that easy?
Anything is possible.
Excuse me?
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
When did you get back?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
No!
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He’d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
I don’t.
And you still haven’t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Should I?
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
Yes. I’m trying to reach a friend but I can’t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn’t have any. I used a British passport. My name’s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
I know where to look.
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
I’m finished here and I’m tired, Emily. You shouldn’t be here. Now don’t make it worse.
What about your friendly cop?
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
May I have your phone number?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
And who does Friedman work for?
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Bye bye, Jane. And don’t be naughty.
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
We conclude our transaction.
Does it matter?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Hyatt... Friedman’s... at the Hyatt...
Should I come back in five minutes?
Have you?
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
Shut up!
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
... No. In fact, I’d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn’t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
Los Angeles?
Excuse me?
I hear you’re looking for Leon.  That makes me, his old-lady, and now you, looking for the little bastard. Leon’s gone, man. Vanished. You interested in his photographs?
I know his work better than I know him.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
The acid bath?
Huh! You’ve been around, eh?
What sums?
That’s what he said...
Don’t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Good.  Until then, feel free to live like a king!
Very generous of you all.  How much?
Now?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Tell the king to give me more men.
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
To be killed in battle?
That's an order!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Quite a few.
And?
No, I... I held it up to...
Oh yes, my lady.  All true kings of France must first be anointed in our great cathedral of Rheims... with the holy oil of Clovis... for it was within these very walls that Saint Remy received the sacred oil from Heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of King Clovis...
No no, you don't understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown King Clovis in this... very... cathedral...
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church.  Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
What about you?
Trial?  What trial??
Not unless you hear my confession.
Yes.
Did it give you advice?  Good advice?
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
You have nothing to regret...
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
I'm... I'm not the king...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
Supposing she's an assassin?
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
God.
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
Yes, it's a miracle.
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
The English are rebuilding it.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
To hell with your voices -- it's time to face facts!  We have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  You should go home, Jeanne.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
Don't swear...
Not for long...
If you kill him, you kill me!
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I never lied!
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Really?
Really?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
Do you think you are ready?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Him?
Who is this "he"?
Oh, yes. I remember.
He's still a doctor.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Just over a year.
Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then...
What, I'm working, what?
They're hunting people on the streets. They've picked up Henryk.
I haven't seen him.
Oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
Who told you?
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
Your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they don't give a damn about people's sufferings, they don't even notice what's going on around them!
A good place for what?  He's insane!
Toilets?
Rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, Wladek.
Why didn't you come to me?
I'm not, but Majorek is.
Wladek! How are you?
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
Cow!
You're a dirty pig!
Be ready to leave in two days' time. Same place as last night.
Sorry, I don't remember.
Doesn't matter. You've nothing to worry about. I'll visit often.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
Ohh no, it makes my skin creep!
Someone died here. It's tapu.
The piano.
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
What are they?
They are washed.
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
It's my mother's piano.
What will I play?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood.  No wonder you got hit.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
What do we do?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
But you played the Big Con.  You said it was nothin'.  A game for flakes and mama's boys.
Salino?  Why waste our best people on a small-time job like this?  It ain't no heavy gee we're after. The guy's a five and dime grifter.
He had his chance and all he did was shoot up a rooming house.  Made a lotte noise and woke up a few cops, but didn't hit nothin'.
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Straight north.  He was gonna take it all and run.
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
All right, mark Mottola up a little and put him on a bus.  Nothin' fancy, just enough to keep him from coming back.  Get some local people to take care of the other two.  We gotta discourage this kinda thing.
Hackers.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
All he's gotta do is read.
He had you down as a big-timer. What happened?
I don't know.  Haven't seen anybody.
We'll get by without 'em.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
He threatened to kill me.
Hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.
I thought I'd lost him.
It was too noisy.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
I appreciate your stickin' your neck out.  I wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for Luther.
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
The name is Lonnegan.
Make sure you see cash from this guy, Eddie.  He's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.
I'll square it with the fixer.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
But what about all these other people?
Yeh, I guess I shoulda had the meat loaf.
If I expected somethin', I wouldn't be still standin' out here in the hall.
How ya doin', Jimmy.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
I am after this race.
What is this?  That's my money. You tryin' to muscle me?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
We were getting 50 from our guy.
All right, get outa here.  You're outta work.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
He's just around the corner.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
You're talking like a crazy person,
Oh, here she is.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You hand that over to the police.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Did he tell you where he was going?
How did you ever remember me?
Macaulay.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
Which way did she fall?
That's the truth.
Yes, she would.
Where are you going?
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
Gilbert!
Ask him.  I don't know.
Man to man, I'm not.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
What do you mean?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
Nunheim!
She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case.  Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
He telephoned me today.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Let him have his say out.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Wouldn't I.  Just watch me.
Why, you said...
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Don't you remember....
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
Go ahead!
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
What did you do with the rest?
Good.
Is Julia going with you?
S'long.
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
They'll want more than your word for that.
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner.  Nice food, isn't it?
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Six Martinis.
We need ice.
Can't you get to sleep?
Maybe a drink would help you.
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You bet I wouldn't.
I did find him!
Nick!
Got a nice evening dress?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Let's see... where was I?  Oh, yes.  He went to find the man. That man was desperate!  He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant.  It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
I hope you're well.
Honest, Mr, Charles.  I never touched that safe.  Them bonds that were missing... Julia took them.
No... no.
I know I left them there.
Home!
What's in the other direction?
This road, it leads straight to Kuwait.
Can you eat it?  If you can't eat it I really don't care what it is.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
Got to be some kind of landmark; something distinctive.
Basically.  But the map has been pretty precise so far.  I don't think it'll be too hard to--
I heard!
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Get off him!
You said he was a deserter.
You don't know he isn't.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
And let me guess who is.
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you.  I suppose.
Knock it off!
Blow me.  Have I said that to you guys recently?  Blow me.
Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes.  Let's get out of here.  We got sand to protect.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Just listen to me!  I've been doing some reading.  In the Sixteenth century this region was invaded by the Turks.  It became part of the Ottoman empire.  When the Turks rolled in they raped, they pillaged, the usual stuff.  Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these bastards.  They buried their treasures, drew maps, and hid the maps in puzzle boxes.  I read about this, man.  I read about it.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
We can see them, they can see us.  We run, they chase.
We run they'll shoot us anyway.  If we keep driving they might think we friendlies; Iraqis.  Or even if they know we're Americans they might get scared, think we're part of a detachment and keep on going.
Look at you, not even breaking a sweat. You're cool, boy.  You're cool.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to be right over here.
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Don't let me die, Epps.  I don't want to die.
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
Yeah, I understand.  Wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find.  That's a sweet deal.
Single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. That's not a battle going on.
Get up and dig.
We've been digging.  We've been digging for hours.  If there was anything here to find we would have found it.
Is it dead?
You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you're wrong, and you're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it.  We're heading Northeast.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
Damn.
It's got to be going better than this..
I just want to look at it.  Remind me of what I'm dying for.
What are we going to do?
And then shoot them.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
I don't know!
...Maybe...maybe we can fight our way out.
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
You come up with a better plan, let me know.
You were shot.  We were standing right there, you were shot!
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
What if it hadn't been Wes?  What if...I mean, accidently, what if I had...
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
For real?  A treasure?
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
You ever think about dying?
Yes!
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
We just about got killed.  You know what happened?  We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
Stress category.
4732...?
I have to see SEN.  I've just been given a shift change.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
I'll try.
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
They're watching us now.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
We're leaving.
No one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  This world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
What?
I want you for my roommate.
I'll report you.  It's....
No, I...
What?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
No......  She's dead THX........
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
No thanks, Bev.
Patch me through to the Bomb Squad.
Just do it.
Hang on.
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
I don't know. You tell me?
Cream of the crop, huh? You?
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
No, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. They're into the power trip, not the damage. What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. The worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
I don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. See, when you beat one of these things... 
Would you?
Okay, let's go in.
Stay to your left.
What's wrong?
"Punks", huh?
We've created a monster.
Taylor's dead.
He's my brother...
People are dying.
Security.
Stay in the truck.
But sir--
I'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
Look, it's important.
Insurance?
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
You don't fish.
That feeling won't last long.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
I promised her she'd be safe.
Yes.
No!
No.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I've got to see you.
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
Thank you, Major. 
The tennis player?
No--no.
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
The pepper, too?
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Two fifty-three, five--
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Spanish passports?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
I know that niche.
Naturally I did.
What's wrong now?
That's what you need!
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Right!
You think that's too much?
Then I mislay my checkbook--
You're hired!
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then lunch in the Bois--
Marvelous.
No--yours, madame.
You're conceited--
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Because I want to make it tough for you.
Mariette!
Goodbye.
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
I wanted to ask her to ask you if you'd be good enough to go out to dinner with me tonight.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
I beg your pardon!
Well, he was in the navy.
Yes, my bag!
Didn't you take it with you?
The pumps --
An hour, two at most.
I'm tryin' boss.
Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
Don't you mean work me?
How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
Honestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Sure. Count me in.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
Ain't you boys ever rowed before? Here, gimme those oars. I'll show ya how it's done.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
If only it were that simple.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
A whole ten cents?!
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
It would be a nice change from you.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Isn't that interesting?
<U>Gladly</U>.
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
But--
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
Good night, idiot!
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
What do you know about them?
Jimmy!
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
Not a chance.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Thank you, sir. 
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
<U>Me</U>!
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
It's a pleasure.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
How?
In New York.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
I thought I put you to bed.
<U>Denby!</U>--Are you Chad Denby?
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
Very--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Don't ask any questions--just give it to me.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Say, "Thanks very much!"
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
Thirty one's and two ten's?
Let me look at it.
Because you ran after me.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
That's Wyatt Earp.  Made quite a Name for himself as a peace Officer in Kansas.
I don't understand.
Come and get him.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
Say when.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on...
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Never even heard of anything like it.
I'll be dipped in shit.  I will, too.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
You did.  Well... thank you.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies?  It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Drop his horse.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Well I'm real scared.
500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that.
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Wyatt...
No, I gotta do something.  I don't Suppose you'd card-
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
Excuse me, but -  I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6.  This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy.
36 hours. They've already sailed from the Persian gulf.
Oh, please, Mr. Bond. We live in the information age! Information is currency - and with the right currency, you can have any piece of information.  Besides I own the phone company. What do you say? Twenty minutes?
And still not a thing to watch.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Where can I find him?
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera.
I'm sorry. It was a national emergency -
Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
Just hold me.
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
Does it work on cash machines?
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Let's take a look at the body.
He tied one on.
... Kids?
You too.
The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
I hope so.
Listen to me! I'm a British secret service agent. And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us.
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Next time, I do the driving.
Indeed they are.  Deadly little things.
Who's Wade?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
Pencil it in for the next trip -
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
About every ninety seconds, the auto- pilot jogs us to the west.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization.  And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock.  The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Robert asks about you. When are you going to do something to help him?
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
Babe Brother.
Can't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong? The world is not black and white. Show me one perfect person. If you can't, don't ask me to be.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Babe Brother is a poor boy.
I wouldn't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it.  Son, you make me wish I was dead.
It's only a tale.
You still call him boy. You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
Only if you can spare it.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
He's not here, Mom.  Woody's gone.
Oh, don't worry, honey, I'm sure we'll find Woody and Buzz before we leave tomorrow.
I wanted to thank you, Woody, for saving my flock.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
Watch yourself!!
Excuse me.
Yes, I can.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Shhh!
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
What?!
Woody!  The rocket!
Hold still, Buzz!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Whaddaya mean, you don't know?
You murdering dog!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Huh?
But you're Irish!
There's not.
Let me in.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
Judge Wakefield, it's an honor to handle it for you.  Consider it gone away.  She's a minor; it probably would've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.
How much?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
Don't you have some good news?  Isn't there something positive you could say.
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
Carl, I'm running late.  I'm coming right now --
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I was just waiting for the right time.
You had it all figured out.  You move into my house.  You raise my kids.  You sleep with my wife.  It was a good plan, Arnie.
So my wife is lying?
Carl, think about it, if I was trying to rip you off, I would have left town after Ruiz was killed.  I wouldn't sit next to you in court listening to the dismissal.
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Oh, it is?
I don't know.
That makes mom the Czarina.  I'm a Czarette.  Like Anastasia.
I don't know.
Yes.
Parents still together?
How are your grades?
Not like.  It is.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Yeah, then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day.
I think so.  If she didn't she should have.  I've only got maybe an hour.  Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home.
You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
I am a legitimate business.  Fishing boats.  Tuna.  Check it out.  Tax records, everything --
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
I don't think you're going to do that.
I don't believe you.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
We agree.
Only if he can be trusted.
I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through.  I'm surprised she hasn't called.
What?
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
Yes, I hope so as well.
No. On you go.
Can you not go yourself.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
I'm going home.
Jesus.
Certainly not.
Fuck, OK.
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Sorry about last night -
No, I'll wash them. I'll take them home and bring them back.
No.
No. Me Neither.
Yeah.
But try too hard --
Goldfinger's better than Dr. No. Both of them are a lot better than Diamonds are Forever a judgement reflected in its relative poor showing at the box office, in which field, of course, Thunderball was a notable success.
Nineteen-sixty-seven.
Fuck off! He never wrote any of them.
The park?
Roald Dahl.
Roald Dahl. Fuck me.
What do you mean?
So who else?
What's wrong, Allison?
He made me lick it.
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
Your usual table, sir?
Why, thank you.
As you wish.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Where did she come up with that?
I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's... normal.
I love people. All people. Even people that no one else loves, I think they're OK, you know. Like Beggars.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
Your threats amuse me, Captain Chekov. What consequences did you have in mind?
Do you realize what you've done? It wasn't bloodshed I wanted.
Bob?
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Have the Klingons responded?
What do you know of my pain?
The power was within you.
A starship? There are no starships on Nimbus III.
If we could send a distress signal...
Beam up Spock and Dr. McCoy. Now!
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Go, Sulu.
Because it's there.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
Goodnight, Bones.
What do you mean?
Is what possible?
"c."... "k."
It's all right, Captain.  Proceed.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
But I thought Captain Chekov..  I see. Very clever, Captain.  Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
Because you, too, must know.
Spock...




It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
No. You must kill me.
Why not?
Hi, Flynn.
No, nuh-uh, never in a million years!
Flynn?
I'm sorry -
The same thing I want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
User requests are what computers are for.
Thank you, no. I have some work to do... assuming I can still log on.
Well, isn't it -- ?
The name of my User, yeah. But how... ?
You're alive!
Why? What are you going to do?
The tower, yes -- Flynn, have you remembered anything else about yourself -- like what sector you're from?
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
It grows on you.
Alan-One...
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Little more juice's all it needs...
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
Then pull yourself together. Get this clown trained. I want him in the Games until he dies playing.
We have to.
I'm shocked.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
I'm not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  You never used to lie to me.  But lately you don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do I look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! And you don't understand anything Dad...
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Probably because it sounds scary.				*
Here, check these out.
Will you just open the door!					*
Well .  .  .  I moved back in. My lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  Don't change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
Goddammit!  That's outrageous.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker. There is only one more question.
You're welcome.
So, it was your first time.
You're not going anywhere.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Yes sir.
I agree.
Juno.  I wish I could say it's a pleasure to see you again.
It's not okay.  It's extortion.
He needed my help.
Would you say he was boring, then?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
And you agreed?
What did you need?
Yes or no.
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Is it working yet?
Are we going to die?
My God.  Have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
What about Juno?
Did you pork her Harry?
No.  But I wanted to.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And what were you going with the international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal?  Taking dictation?
Get going! 
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Hold that thought.
Fuck you.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Yes.  Now go.
Just for the operation in Paris. I need to be married.  They'll be looking for a man traveling alone.
Helen.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
No.  He checked out okay--
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Do you have a fella?
So he really loved her?
Who?
Who and what is a Drexl?
Is he black?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
What?
You will?
Thank you.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
What?
... was so romantic.
How come?
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
It's great to hear from you.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Elliot.
No shit? Dick, that's great!
How 'bout me what?
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
What department?
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Get on your knees.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Why does he trust you?
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
Nope.
Keep it.
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around.  I love you son.
Where'd you come from?
Do you believe him?
I believe he believes him.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
I didn't mean -
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.
Uh, I think so.  In the mental hospital.
Well, sir, I don't think the human mind was built to exist in two different... whatever you call it..."dimensions." It's stressful, you said it yourselves, it gets you confused.  You don't know what's real and what's not.
You're still a little... disoriented.
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
And your only goal is...???
Have you been a patient at County? Have I seen you someplace?
What kind of information?
Hiding?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
And I was in it?  What did I do?
That has your name on it.  Give him cash.
No!  I...don't think so.  I stole a car and they chased me.  I hit a tree.
It can be dealt with, but only if you want to.  I can help you.
The gun! ... I lost it
You're sure?
I think I saw a TV show like that when I was a kid.  Where a boy...
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
I've managed to contact certain underlings, evil spirits, secretaries of secretaries, and assorted minions, who will contact my father. When he learns I'm in this kind of place, he'll have them transfer me to one of those classy joints where they treat you...properly. LIKE A GUEST!  LIKE A PERSON!  SHEETS! TOWELS!  LIKE A BIG HOTEL WITH GREAT DRUGS FOR THE NUT CASE LUNATIC MANIAC DEVILS...
You know -- your plan.
It's private.
Not, "what", babe!  When!
Monkeys.  Twelve of them.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
And that's when I told you my father was this famous virologist and you said, "Hey, he could make a germ and we could steal it!"
I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
Yes, sir.
Ex-psychiatrist!  Now, what about flashlights?  How many flashlights...?
No, thank you.
I'll be right here...just in case.
You can't do that yourself?
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
I'm a little short. I'll catch you next time.
You afraid of the dark?
You want to make a kiddies bet?
Hundred and eight already.
You ain't nothing but an old fool.
It is not.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
Yeah, I can fix it.  Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can find a hose like this one, or close enough. Gonna take time.
Twenty-after-ten.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
A God damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You've been there?
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
Let me have a Beck's.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Sheriff Potter.
My cup runneth over, beauti--
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
That's all right.  I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
Least you can leave.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Thank you.
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
The same thing you do.
Like they're made of polyester.
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
Still playing?
You know what I want.
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
You could just leave him.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't.  I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
Whatever it takes.
Is it pretty?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Jake.
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Is it so bad?  It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
What about us?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
The only reason I stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about Jake.  But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby.  We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
You don't know?  Jesus Christ! Don't you think you should have found out before we killed him?
Get it, and put the money in it. Pack up anything else you want to take with you.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Not me.  Us.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
You could give me the gun.
But you said we could be together.
I think I busted my leg.
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
Is this what it's all about?  You sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  Forget it.  You want to take my head off, Mister, I won't even try to stop you.  I deserve it for being an idiot.  But if you're not, I think I'll be on my way.
You've got to be--
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Hungry?
You just seem to attract trouble, don't you?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
What makes you say that?
And for that you'd kill Grace?
How do you put a price on murder?
How much could you get?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Shut up.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me--
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
Liar.
You know what kind of woman Grace is.  You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Sierra.  What makes you think when you were planning on killing her she wasn't doing the same for you?  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who would have you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
I said come on!
You're too quick for me.
Eighteen.  Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
Get away from me!
Make time?  Is everybody in this town slap happy?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
He is at that.  No so much a fault of his own.  Poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
There's nothing in the trunk, Sheriff.
Christ no!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
That a fact?
Well, people gotta get by somehow. That's the curse. The mines done it. All that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! Everybody's got a mother. You don't rip up your mother. You don't rip up the Earth and take everything out. It's like the Cracker Jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
You afraid of the dark?
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
What?  You want to fight?  Over her?
Oh, shit!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Grace, tell him.
That's a solid name.
Darrell's a moron.
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would you kill her?
How do you know if you've never tried?
This is a joke, right?  You just want to rattle me.  Right?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
Two-hundred dollars?
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
What's your name anyway?
Will you shut up!
Get away from me!
You own this place?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
You believe that?
No charge.
Two-hundred.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
Darrell.
Open up!
I want my car.
Eh?
Do you have to call me that?
I like that about me, beautiful.
Accident.
You're not from around here, are you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
A medicine man?
Like you.
Nothing like a little liveliness.
I have an idea.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
Did you ever?
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted <u>more</u>. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there  at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I want a place where only the vultures will find him... It'll be over soon, Grace.
What are you talking about?
And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you...
Yeah, fell down and hit a rock. Not as bad as it looks.
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
With a <u>shotgun</u>!  She kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. Not one bill is left alive.  I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
How much?
One way.
30.55. Twenty more will get you back.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Four.
I'll keep it in my office room.
I have a lock on the door.
What does that mean?
Yes.
Rust?
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Think carefully?
I don't know for sure.  ...I don't think so.
Skeptical about what?
I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'
We're not proceeding anywhere together.
But not a knife?
That's not what I witnessed David.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's kind of a miracle.
No.
What if you worked out everyday for six months? You think you could beat him then?
How much can you lift?
No Jeremy.
It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
How so?
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.  I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game.  It's not a thing many people would understand.
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
For what they done? Skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
Building his porch!
Didn't give us nothin' but his own name... Ned Roundtree.
Scouting?
Three days. Are you hungry?
That big guy lookin' for me?
Yeah, I guess.
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Oh.
Alive?
Uh... a little, maybe.
You an' Andy get the hell out there. Find out where them other two went.
This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
All week?
That much, huh?
You could run off them two cowboys.
Well... uh... I... I ain't got no, uh, firearms.
Meaning the duck himself, I guess.
Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  Look here, let me show you somethin'.  See this here pistol?
Is... is it... loaded?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Yeah, he went South ahead of us. I guess we'll catch him before...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
I'm a damn killer myself, only I ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. Schofield Kid, they call me.
About what?
Thousand dollars of reward. Five hundred a piece.
No.
Huh?
Lookin' at?
You don't recollect!
You boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
Yup.
Sure. Sure, Bill.
You're gonna kill him, ain't you?
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.  M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
Yeah.
Well, she...
Sure, I got to. Got to get supplies.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
He wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. He wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
Maybe.
Who ?
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
He says the hair is longer and lighter.
They want more time to think about investing.
Why you gotta go and do that? I'm trying to make a point.
Can we stealth these guys?
Hockney was just a bad bastard. Good with explosives. Mean as a snake when it mattered .
You okay?
Well, I'm sorry.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
What about Redfoot?
Mr. Soze will be most -
We know you can get to us, and now you know we can get to you. I'm offering you the chance to call this off.
Some Limey. He's a middle-man for somebody. He doesn't say and I don't ask.
Tell him we'll meet.
Where?
I'11 find him.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
What?
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Kobayashi.
I know he was good.
I just want to hear your story.
He didn't have my lawyer.
I know Ruby. He's very big on respect. Likes me very much.
I'11 be sure to mention that to him.
Keaton always said: &quot;I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him.&quot; Well I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi. The quartet was in my file, along with every other thing I had done since high school, see? Aliases, middle- men. They knew me better than I did. They knew all of us.
What call?
But Keaton...
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan. I mean the Devil himself. How do you shoot the Devil in the back?
I don't
Keaton was Keyser Soze
Is he Keyser Soze I don't know, Verbal. It seems to me that Keyser Sate is a shield. Like you said, a spook story, but I know Keaton - and someone out there is pulling strings for you. Stay here and let us protect you.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Abrams.  Yes.  How are you today?
Four cases in three years ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
No.  Absolutely, and we're going to see that it is not.
All right.  But let's keep the price down.  I've called Ed Concannon.  He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
You thought it was just.
Frank Galvin's ... who's calling please?  Bishop Brophy's office ...
Don't equivocate.  Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby.  Were you not?
When she...
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
...I'm sure it is, but this is Massachusetts, Doctor.  Certified in Internal Medicine?
I know of him.
I am seventy-four years old.
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price.  They wanted this cleared up in court.  They want their vindication.  I agree with them.  But for today the offer stands.  Before we begin the publicity of a trial.  For today only.    When I  walk out that door the offer is withdrawn.  As long as you understand that.  It's got to be that way.
That's not my handwriting.
... that's all right.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
I am seventy-four years old.
Then what good would it do to ruin the reputation of two men, to help a girl whose life's not going to be changed in the least?   You know what CODE BLUE means?
The Doctors were not negligent.
...I made a reservation at...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle ... her estate ...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
I want someone who was in the O.R. We're going to win the case, there's no  question of that.  It's just a matter of how big...
You know what happened.
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
I'd just like to get to the point, Mr. Galvin.  Let's not waste these people's time.  Answer the question, Mr. Witness.  Please.  Would a nine-minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence?
I understand.  Thank you, my name is Galvin.  I'll be at the following number in a half an hour.  It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
That's why I'm calling, Miss Price...
Laura.
...and is that serious?
That's not the question.  It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault?  If I'd...if I'd...I never should have taken it.  There was no way that I was going to win.
I...do you want me to leave?
Where is he?
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
...I have to stand up for her...
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
You use their witness.
...one of the other nurses?
What difference can that make...? All right...
How old are you, how many children ... when did you last eat ...
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
It's locked.
... fifty thousand dollars?
... I understand ...
I'm going to see you get that chance.
She told me.
I used to be a nurse.
It's a long road that has no turning.
That's for sure, Frank.
Yes.
We'd gone to 'Code Blue,' we were administering electro...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Because she was anemic.  It's right there on her chart. Her brain was getting less oxygen anyway...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Me, too.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
How long have you been back?
No.
Ernie's.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
That's Carlotta Valdes.
But you knew about this.
And when she goes to those places...
She is not my wife.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
But why?
Yes. Yes, I do.
To complete my cure.
Go up the stairs, Judy.  I'll follow.
No! Let me go!
You can't. You're afraid!
Some money.
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where had you been before?
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Oh! Yes! Here!
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
Some people prefer it.
No... it's wrong.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
The tall trees...
Long ago...
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
What?!
Yesterday.
Only this far.
It's all there. It's no dream.
I can't imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
I've never run across one like that.
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
Sorry, old man. Work.
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Yeah.
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Just wander.
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
Don't touch her. Call 911.
That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead whore?" She's a person!
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What's that?
No first of all. I'm not in a game mood.
Name one.
Eat my ass!
What?
Why?
There's more.
Just giving the facts.
I'm calling the police.
Someone goes to Walmart, gets some buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and Span, the works.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
That is absolutely not true.
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They won't figure it out.
No...we want padded chairs...okay?
I won't do it.
If anything ever happens to me...
What.
You and I have done nothing. You especially. We are innocent.
Where's the bathroom?
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
You're a liar. I want to know what happened in Vegas.
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Fish?
Left side.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
No, this is the perfect time. This is real time. Adam. Your brother and I, as well as several others present, have always suspected that you...  ...are a fully repressed, living in major denial, locked down, fly-boy butt-fucker.
Shut up Boyd.
He is not cracking up.
What did you ask me?
What?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
Okay fine.
Whatever you say Kojak.
The hell I did!
Not true.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Yup.
You forgot the tent?
Why did you forget the tent check?
I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.
Well it's bad timing.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Charles Moore for instants.
You don't like Moore? Since when?
What does Moore have to do with your growing?
He's weird.
Of course.
Okay.
What kind of seats can we have?
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
I will.
I'm mad at you.
I left a message. I think it's going to be okay.
"At first I thought it was infatuation ...But oh it's lasted so long..."
Talk what out? We are locked and loaded here. We are non-refundable. I've got relatives on the airport right now! I've got...
I know.
What are you talking about?
Micheal, by accident.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
No buts. I told you your friends were Jackasses.
What does that mean?
You put him down or don't bother coming back.
Yeah, Dad. It's great.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
The wahoo?
I've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I can't find it. And what if I already had it? You know. My moment? What if it's gone? And I never saw it?  You're getting married, man. That's a fucking beautiful thing. Just a beautiful thing. I just can't stop breaking beautiful things.
Did she believe you?
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
...embarrassing, shameful...
That's our plan.
So you didn't come from the poorhouse!
What's that?
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Come down.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
You see, even the voice.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
And what do you know about life? When all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
Tell her I lied, that I didn't take advantage of her.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
It's Viridiana. She's getting on my nerves.
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I know that you used to work with an architect.
They worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
Come with me.
But, miss ...
I had so many things to think about!
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Right, let's go.  And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
I'm getting by.
If you can catch him.
On my life, I promise you I will.
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
Letting a lunatic like Parker Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse. At some point, he will go off -- you saw what happened in the simulator. The risk to the public is unacceptably dangerous.
The man played judge, jury, and executioner with eight people's lives. He lost control and is capable of doing it again.
Only because I got pulled out early.
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
How do you know I won't run?
You know how much man power you're talking about?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'm still making adjustments...
Do I get to see it or not?
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
Amazing. I hate to say it, but it is.
It was you, wasn't it?
I couldn't just let them make you bring down my degree of difficulty. I'm a triple-twisting, double back flip off the high platform, not a swan dive.
Of course you are.
I know. I was there. I saw the whole thing.  If I was your therapist, I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Go to hell.
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
You're not capable of it.
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Then shoot him already.
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
What are you saying...
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
<u>Hello</u>.  What?
Hello, <u>King</u>.  How the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>Get</u> out...  <u>Get</u> out... Well, man, you fall in love like a <u>Hillbilly</u>...  Ditch the wife, toss the kids in the Pick-up,   Listen, King:  <u>Get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
King, we've got to be on the streets in...
It's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>President</u>...
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
Yes -- It will... Now:  why is the President in China?
They caught him in the closet with a Girlscout.  Side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  You have to keep'em guessing for  Two weeks.  You  don't have to Cure Cancer, Pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
I'm working on it.  Same time, you call Billy Scott at Joint Chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to Seattle, y'got that...?  All flustered and worried. To talk to the <u>Boeing</u> people.
....we landing?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What's it gonna cost? 
Who would find out?
The American "people"?
What do you know about them?
Precisely.
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
A young Albanian Girl, dressed in their...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
Napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
...what are we going to do...?
WHERE'S MY FUCKING <u>PIIIILLLLLLL</u>...?
ON BREAN, WHO IS DOODLING.
The President is going to declare War against Albania in a half an hour.
Why do they go to War?
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
You're goddamn right.  And it's got nothing to do with the B-2 Bomber. 
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
Hey, I know that, hey, I'm <u>kidding</u>...  "It's a pageant"
...it's a Teaser!
President's speech.
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
They got him standing by.
S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?
I've come to feel It's my thing.  You know, you take a job... You take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  And then...
...<u>isn't</u> it?  Hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
Come on, Pal, come on Willie, come on, Old Shoe...
Ha ha.  No, no, not <u>now</u>, not <u>now</u>, of course, But Someday... when they tell <u>this</u> story...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
A proud tradition.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
That's <u>one</u> thing, but I'm not gonna let two dickheads from <u>Filmschool</u> take it... are you <u>Nuts</u>?  Are you <u>Nuts</u>?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
...as of today, 89% favorable.
Hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  I think we're up-and-running...
...this is nothing.  This is nothing. D'you ever shoot in <u>Italy</u>?  Try three Italian starlets on Benzedrine, this is a walk in the park...
They don't know what's going on!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
I'd love to, Mr. Lynch, thank you.
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
You mean teach you how to play. Can't. Going fly fishing in Canada, big client...
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Coulda been a contender.
How's Mom?
...Work okay?
...don't be crazy. Put it to your school loans.
I met them before you were born.
No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
Yeah, right...
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
He never told me...
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
I know...the decision'll clear the way for new planes and route contracts. There's only a small float out there, so you should grab it. Good for a five point pop.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
Nice to see you again Mr. Gekko.
Sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. Here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?
...finish out the game, Bud, push yourself...
The most valuable commodity I know of is information. Wouldn't you agree on that?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox.
What makes you think you can?
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Dump it.
Excuse me.
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Why?
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Oh Christ!
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
No. This time I'm in for the long term. This is not a liquidation, Gordon. I'm going to turn it around. You're getting a free ride on my tail, mate, and with the dollars you're costing me to buy back the stock, I could modernize the plant. I'm not the only one who pays here Gordon. We're talking about lives and jobs; three and four generations of steel workers...
Just give it a break China ok? CHINA Jeez.  Can't even take a joke
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
China.  What happened? CHINA Shhh.  It's ok.  I missed you so much.
Hmm.
Uh, wrong picture Tony.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
What?
No.
Yes, but...
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
Have you been hurt?
Everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
I don't know.
Oh-kay...
Give me that shit.  Your wife.
I've seen you.  From the window.
And I'm afraid.  Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Thank you.
Um...sure.
I couldn't catch my breath.  That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked.  I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  I tried to leave him.  Went to my mother's in Boston.  He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Claire.
This is...
...just so she could cut them off.
And there's this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in Finnish.
Do we have to?
Good.  I'm good.
Wow.  Got here just in time.  I brought you this.
The planchette?
This.
I don't know.
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Yes.  Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
Don't.
Three o'clock.
Fine.
Tomorrow.
I'll be there.
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
In the house.  I was scared.
Wow.
Well, that's nice.
Norman, you are so funny about that.  No, I didn't.
What's going on, Claire?
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
It's a ghost.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Well, that's a relief.
Norman...
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Who did?
Sweetheart--
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
I will NOT.
Call ya later.
Good.  You sat in front...I saw you there...
No.  I'm afraid to ask what this is about.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  Until now.
So you fucked a student?!
She can't be here without me.
IT'S TRUE.  That's...you have to believe me!  Oh God, I'm telling you the truth!  I did what I had to, Claire.  She was gone.  There was nothing I could do for her.  I did...I put her in the lake.  I rolled the car in...and I watched it sink.  And I've lived with that image ever since.  I couldn't just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  Don't you see, Claire?  She's doing this!  This is exactly what she wants you to think!
Shhhh.
:Well, they are.
Then focus on how you feel about her. Because your feelings define you.   Take off your gloves, Michael.
Yes - and you have.  Do you see...?  He was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
He made that quite clear, yes.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Hello...?  Who is this...?
I wish to speak to Ellie Mayfair.
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I want to see my mother.  Where is she...?
A Mayfair it ever I saw one.
Other properties as well - here and in Europe.  And vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  Liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. All yours now.
YOU VIOLATED ME!!!  ON MY WEDDING NIGHT!
I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I LOVE him!
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
HARDER!
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?

What's wrong..?
Is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  God, Michael --- what am I...?
Guess so.    I keep thinking about the witches - when I was... down there    There was - caring.  They saved me, Ro.  They said 'go back'...  Wel1-  I came back - to you - to love you.  I like seeing it that way, y'know...?
Maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
It's not some fairytale in an old book.    Michael - look at me.  I didn't choose this, Michael.  This is who I am.  I love you.
ROWAN we're below sea level. I've spent time there myself.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
Is that what you were doing...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
I wasn't a manager here then MRS STECKLER - don't you remember?
I really don't know what to say
What's with all the locks - and hammering
I'm a dentist
And how long have you been a dentist?
No - the police say I've killed fourteen - but I've not - I've killed many more. It amazes me how they just haven't found the bodies. What is society coming to when people just don't get missed. I agree, some of them are well hidden - I probably couldn't even show you where I put them - one girl, number eight I think the press called it - she wasn't even mine - I don't know who did it but I didn't
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know
Because a dog will attack with a ferocity and force that we poses, but centuries of social contamination has run it out of us - that is what sets us aside from the purity of the beasts...Society is rotting - men who once were strong and kept everything working are getting soft - women are making them soft - by the time a pretty girl has reached twenty - she has had three lifetimes worth of fun and attention- so she doesn't deserve any more -
What did you do with her?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
then why did you marry her -
Why should I?
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Nothing could be better...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
I'm your landlady
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Were you always this sick?
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation.
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
Take a whiff of heaven.
With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip.
Except the girl. The only one that really mattered.
These are real, live women?
You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers.
He kicked major ass and you know it.
Yeah? You like?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
It's okay. You need me?
Got it.
I almost didn't recognize you without...you know...that stallion between...your...uh...legs.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive.
They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile.
Very funny.
My room?
Just a formality.
Are you kidding? Mom and Dad discover I'm gone and I'll be doing hard time.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
You never know around here.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
I doubt it.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Then you'll see who's really holding on to you.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
What about you?
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
I see.
Not a chance.
You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I made a commitment. I said I'd do it and I have to keep my word.
I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Everything is lovely, Ted, but much too expensive.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Mr. Nelson, you disappoint me. First you break our school board rules. Then you break the law.
You called the cops on us?
Alcohol does horrible things to a developing young mind.
I have only one concern...
Tipping?
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Whoa. But...that's the thing...  I've never even actually...
I was like a different person tonight.
That's perfect.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
You're a great kid. Don't you forget it.
Kelly Van Ryan...
Sam... I...  Sandra Van Ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  She's pushing for suspension...
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
And where might that be?
The teeth doin' any talkin'?
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Raised her like she was, but no, Walter's my only child.  He was a good boy, till the army took him.
I know you do.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Yes.  I said stop.  I screamed.  I mean that's how it sounded in my head.  He hurt me...
He was large?
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Suzie Toller is missing.
Maybe she used another name.
I flat don't like the guy, Glory.  He's dirty.  And I'll tell you something else.  You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money?  He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.  It was after the war.  Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
Where's the body?
Where's Lombardo?
So you were alone.
I worked Juvenile in Dade County for three years.  We had a missing persons on Kelly Van Ryan for two weeks... Maybe a year ago... The family kept it out of the papers.
I told Kelly Van Ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  I did her rights.
She looked shaky, but lucid.  I thought, I would just go with her, stand at the door...  I think I looked away.  A split second. Then, bingo.  Just like that.  She puts a knee into my groin.  There was this coffee table between us and the wall.  She got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  Thing had a glass door.  I could hear it breaking.  I didn't go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  Before I could get to her, she'd turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  I yelled at her to put it down.  She got off a shot.  I took it in the shoulder.  I... I had no choice. I returned fire.  Two rounds, I think. In the chest.
Suzie!  Did this man rape you?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Your Honor... Please...
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
You are.
What brain?
Shit.
I would hardly say you look like trash.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
I'm here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I'm leaving again tonight.
So you got my mom's money.
We have to stick with the plan.
Hello.
I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
Not in here.  Chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
Sound nice?  It's a fucking drug rehab farm.  It's where Kelly Van Ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  Meanwhile, you get educator of the year I mean there's no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  Shit, they haven't even taken your statement yet.  Reason?  They're still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they're coming up empty.  Now tell me I'm right.
That's right.
Suzie Toller is dead.  You don't want Kelly to be next, then take my advice. Stay out of my way.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
And she wanted to talk.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
With a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet T-shirt with no bra...
Are you mad at me?
The guy was history when he killed Kelly.  You knew that.
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Swamp's where it's at, Sandy.  Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  You ought to try it some time.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
Almost?
Yes.  Now, observe....
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
Hey, I tried the board.
It's not a guy...
We oughta get a couple of those rockets.  Voom!  We're there before we left!
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
Of course not.
Where have you been?
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
All right, all right... It'll be okay.  I mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
Yes, in a way.  I'm the Doctor's social secretary.  I handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
My friend?
French?
He didn't.  That's your job.  I'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. Good luck.  Nice train.  But mine's nicer.
Dr. Loveless?
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
It's a smelting retort.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
When are they coming?
You managed alright.
Is this what's left of your army?
Thought you might get lonely, Mad- martigan!
Let's go.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
You're not a woman.
I love you.
I don't believe you.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
Of course!  I promise!
Where the hell did you come from?
I did?
Well what did she say?
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
She's a bird, Willow.
What a great son you are, Ranon.  I wish I could take you with me.  Now go to sleep...
Then I will teach you.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
The art of transformation!
There's nobody here.
Why?
He never misses.
Who is that horrible friend of yours?
Hurry!  Queen Cherlindrea will know what to do.
Milking?
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in –
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
You couldn't wait until morning?
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Only the elders.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
There was.
I was being foolish?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
I have to help him!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Oh -- all right.
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
Here, here, what's all this jabber-wapping when there's work to be done?  I know three shiftless farm hands that'll be out of a job before they know it!
Is morally, ethic'ly
Well, I -- I -- I am the Great and Powerful -- Wizard of Oz.
This?
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Toto, too.
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Has it poppies on the wall....
That's all -- the Crystal's gone dark.
Destroyed?  Toto?  Oh, you can't!  You mustn't! Auntie Em!  Uncle Henry!  You won't let her, will you?
Oil can....
All hollow.  Oh --
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh! Oh!
Hah!
Supposin' you met an elephant?
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
My, it's good to be....
They would?
That's where I live.  And I want to get back there so badly I'm going all the way to Emerald City to get the Wizard of Oz to help me.
Yes.  Oh -- look --
Oh, you don't think we're going to stand by and let her get away with fireballs and bees, do you?
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
It's a whatzis?
Whozat?
Oh, poor Dorothy. We may never see her again.
Not nohow!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
NO!
No, sir!
I'd be clever as a gizzard --
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Yeah --
Bond --
It’s part of some plan. She dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  The explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
The King pipeline.
Elektra would control it all.
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
Who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
I’m well aware of your stake in this, 007. If you have a point, get to it.
Renard.
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
It’s I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
Yes.
I know.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard?
You turned Renard.
No-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons?
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
No!  Get me out!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
I’d heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Still no contact yet.
I would like to use the bathroom --
They want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
I could stay and go.
Then you're sleeping with Dreiberg?
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because --
Please, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a universe to explore.  I'll be alone.  You're the last human being I'll ever see.
I'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .
The south pole.  Time¹s flowing backwards.
Veidt¹s complex.
I see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!
You know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs -- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.
If he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected you.  Haven't I?  Do you need money?
She's with me.
Old?
Antarctica??
All right.  Mission accomplished.
Those cars.  What year is this??
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
Nothing.  What were you going to say?
Did you know he was back on the streets?
You're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.
What are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?
I don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit --
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
You're making a big --
Dr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save the world.
What is this place?
Diner, huh? Let me tell you what the problem is. I wake up drugged to find what? You've got a "salesman" over here reading a three week old newspaper. He's pulling a 211 with a "trucker", who happens to be packing a cop issue H&K 9mm. I get tipped that something is going down when she passes me a note. How's that for twisted logic? How did she know there was trouble unless they pulled the guns before I "walked" in? And if that's true, why'd they stop and wait until I woke up to gaffle the money? Then I notice how beefy they both are. Hell, even the waitress is cut. All three of them look like they went through the same training program. Ergo they ain't strangers and this isn't what it seems. That's how I knew yo-yo wouldn't get a round off even if I gave him all day. Why?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
You've got this wrong. You're not under arrest, you've been abducted. And until I say different, you belong to me.
I'm not interested. I've already got a job.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Somebody else makes those decisions, not guys like you and me. You've done your job, X, head back to Prague. I'll be landing in 90 minutes. This is my operation now.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Naturally.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
What are you gonna do? They're Euro- trash.
He gets to be the hero.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Let me.
No, it's like a safety. We are going to have to access the manual controls.
Listen to you. Right away, sir, anything you say, sir.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
A parachute. This does not argue well.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
You got it, man. It's stupid but it's true. True freedom is when you do whatever you want anytime you want. That's when you know you're living, man.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
... until he found tungsten.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What if I like the pain?
Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
INTENTION?  Intention, Senator?  We are talking about mankind here.  His fear.  It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps.  Studied for weaknesses.  And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
And you think it helps calling her Rogue?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes.  Now come on Charles.  For old times sake, for your sake...  Leave him to me.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Ugly, vicious rumous.
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
Yes, sir.  Do you want the other cauliflower?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Surprised?
Miss me?
Promise??
Mother's going to help me with the invitations.
Darling!
I mean, it's been a long day. I'm sure you must be as tired as I am.  Oh!  These are my assistants:  Inga and Ayegor.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
That's a tough choice.
Does that include the key to the laboratory?
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Well, thank you very much for all your trouble.
Vermicelli.
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
And do you also say Fro dereck?
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
You were sent by Herr Falkstein, weren't you?
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
How do you do?
Yes, just the two.
No.
What?
No, but when I first came in, there was a light coming from behind that steel door.
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
It's always been one of my favorite names.
It wasn't me.
Yes.
... Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Act casual!
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
That sound good, boss.
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
There's only one way.
How's everything?
Yes, I'm going to set you free.  Is the sedative ready?
... It's.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Don't you think I know that?  But what are you judging by?  Bucharest??? This was always a hick town.  They can't get a 'Bus and Truck' company to come in here.  Are you going to let these idiots get the best of you? ...Or are you going to stand up like a man and show them that you've got more dignity in your little finger than they've got in all their beer- bloated bodies put together?
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
'Dilation of his sacral parasympathetic impulses would cause an increase in flow of blood and the erection to approximately nineteen inches of his apparatus genitals.'
Raise the platform, hurry!
What's wrong, Doctor?  You seem... lonely.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Yes, I know.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
The doctor said to allow seven minutes:  no more and no less -- or else they could both become hopelessly paralyzed.
What d'ya want to do to kill time?
Food!
Food!!
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
Which one?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.

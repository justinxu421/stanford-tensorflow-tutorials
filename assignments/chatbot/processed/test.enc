Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
do you listen to this crap?
Wow
Did you change your hair?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Hi, Joey.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
Daddy, no!
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
No, but
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
He seems like he thrives on danger
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
It's a lung cancer issue
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
What'd you do to her?
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
I'm on it
I just upped my price
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
William would never have gone to a state school.
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
What'd he say?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
hey.  Great show, huh?
Excuse me?
That's what you want, isn't it?
What's this?
I told you
Why'd you let him get to you?
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
Kat! Wake up!
Then why'd you ask?
Unwelcome.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Yes
Why not?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
My insurance does not cover PMS
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Hi.
Kat a fan, too?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
I missed you.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Trade, Your Excellency.  According to Marco Polo, the Kingdom of China is one of the richest of the world. Even the meanest buildings are roofed with gold.
The Judgment is ours!
I don't want you to wait for me.
Beatrix, I want to ask you something.
May I ask by whom?
I have to explore the mainland.
Chief says -- he has a God.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
Wait!  I've waited seven years already!  How much longer do you want me to wait?
How long?
I believed in you...
And you say this is an Indian vice? By God!  I don't see any kind of pleasure that would make this a sin.
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
I brought you some letters.  It's really fan mail.  Women mostly.  One wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. Another wants a check.
Look, I haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
Thirty-percent.  No more.  Or I call another lawyer.  This is the biggest case of your life.  Don't try to negotiate.  Thirty percent.  Say yes or no.
Your mother was blind?
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
Now I become custody of police department?
So you were never a prostitute?
They're not gonna send you right back.
I'll make some for us.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
I let her take a shower.
What was that, Korfin?
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Any I.D.?
What's wrong?
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
You know what that is, right?
If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  What about the report?
I'll let you know what happens.
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
You wanna talk to her alone?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Alright.
What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement.
Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something.
Could be Leon's.
Well, that's great.
I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
Were you a fireman?  That how you knew how to rig the apartment?
Tell him to put his gun down!
Is he with you?  Are you travelling together?
We are both from Prague.
Two weeks.
Don't speak Russian!
Speak English!
Let me get a shot of it.
This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.'  And 'action!'
Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
Traitor!!
We spent it!
No way!  He's mine!
Yeah, I'm religious.  I'm not an Atheist like you!  Now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
Yeah?  What kind?
You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious?
Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
What are you gonna do?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
CONTINUED
Well, it's nothing really important, but it's annoying.
Really.
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
I guess it isn't.
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Two more.
Well, don't worry about it.
Are you coming to my party?
How many days until you come home?
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you.
How is gregor?
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
What do you mean?
I see.
That's true.
I know you did, Frank, but I assure you there was an impending failure.
Name?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
How about it?
You got a name, cop?
Try Cates.  And let's talk in private, okay?
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
Yeah.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a place. Let's go eat.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Let's go.
I'm impressed with you too, Jack you did a real good job of busting up a couple of dykes bedded down for the night.
Where's the goddamn car?
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
I let women get to me.  The quest for pussy is the meaning of life ... I got my own personal philosophy about 'em.  Keep women separate from guns, money and business ... women are for spending money.  They got nothing to do with helping you make it.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
A long time agb Luther must of got the shit beat out of him so bad it just rattled his brain ... that would account for him making so many wrong moves in a row...
No class...
You stay with me...
Where's luther?
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz got away. Got all my money. It just don't seem right.
Hey, there she is...
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Jack?
Yeah?
Try not to get your ass shot to pieces. We got enough dead cops on this one.
How did they get away?
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
So do you...been a long day.
Bullshit red tape.
When? How?
I do think all psychotherapy is bullshit. But just because I think it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't know something about it.
That's the way I see it, too.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Hi, it's me...
How hot are they?
Can't complain.
We'll follow you.  Take it slow,okay?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Rosalie, you okay?
You want to go outside?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
What kind of mission?
We have to save the world.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
I just found a picture of you.
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
Hi Ma...
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I don't think this is a good time...
To save the world.
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Where you going?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Not going to open?
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Yes, Sir!
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
What happened to you?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
She's all I've got.  She's the only witness.
Snuff?
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I'm telling you...
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
A fellow investor.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
I'm not so sure about this.
You're gonna be seeing a lot of me. You're sure you don't mind?
Told him you could get him a snuff film.
Yeah.
I want to know.  I want to know exactly what you did to her!
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
That's right.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You just strike me as smart enough to be doing something else.
Alright, I get the picture.
What's this?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
No.
You... you need to go to the police.
Okay.
Send it to me through the post office like we arranged.  No return address.  You dug this up all by yourself?
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
I don't know.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
It got to be too much for him.
You have to forgive me, but in these circumstances... with your daughter...  Were there any indications of... any sort of abuse?
I had to ask.  I apologize.
I... I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow...
Hello... ?
Who are you?
No...
Whatever possessed you to keep this all this time?
The um... you'll find my invoice in the envelope. If that's all...
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?
It was bad.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
I gotta get to the library before it closes.  Killer physics test.
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful...
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
It was Freddy.
About Freddy?
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
I though Freddy was just an old town story.
Excuse us, dear.
Hey...wake up.
It's lonely in there, in my room.
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?
Who says I don't like you?
Where is he?
But how...?
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you.  Or me.  Or us.  Remember...
There you go.  Love you.
Dad!
I've got to go.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
You, too?
Your 'out.'  This came for you. 
Unidentified Flying Objects.
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
So?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
What course, Skipper?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
Why do you say that?
We read you!  Go ahead, Doctor!  They're inside the saucer.  It's filled with breathable air!
But - what can we accomplish?
Remove your weapons, Commander. And come here - alone!
He did!
Obviously.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Tell me.
I screwed up the divorce. I agreed with everything she said. I wanted her to like me. I just want to be a good father.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Shit! What are we gonna do?
You think so.
You might gut-shoot it or cripple it for somebody else to find and tag. Can't guarantee that won't happen, especially with a new gun. I may have to shoot it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
Yeah?
Oh.
What happened?
Musta... How'd I know? What're you doing, playing cop?
Well, I didn't actually see him do it. Like I said.
No what?
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
What? You called Mommy? Just now?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
Dad.
Are we going in this?
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
It belongs to Pop.
I know what Mommy says. I'm in charge today, though.
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Don't go playing policeman.
Huh?
You ain't the hunter Jack is. And he can't drive the grader worth shit.
On what you pay me?
Maybe.
The key, Wade.
We've done all our talking, Wade.
See. Get your boots.
I still don't understand --
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
When did she die?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
Where... how'd you hear that?
His office. You mean my old office.
Love! I'm made of love!
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
Wade, it's late. I know you're probably at Toby's, but I'm in bed reading. We got different habits.
No shit.
That it wasn't an accident.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
A hunting accident is perfect.
Not particularly.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
You don't want to say hi to your father?
Alice...
You're right and I'll tell you a secret.  I know exactly how you feel.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...
We don't know that.
They aren't answering their hails.
I prefered the terrorists.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
If challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
We're not going to make it.
*                     Please tell me your name.
You got what you wanted. You going to release us now?
This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
There goes your ride.
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. Our hands are completely tied while they're in the air.
The northern border's gotten a bit hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag with our Tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
Sir, we stay with the President.
May I speak to you for a moment?
For godsakes, Jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  Not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  Don't you think it's a sign you're pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on MTV news than in person.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Did they say anything about my family?
and if that means negotiating...
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
Okay... if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
Dunn.
Elaine.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Ted.
Elaine!
Simon just ejected!
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Maybe.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
That's not possible.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
Sixteen 'C', why?
What should I say?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Ted!
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
What's his problem?
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
You promise you'll write.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Hi!
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
William Harcourt?
Nothing.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
If I may make a suggestion... We have different weak spots than you do.  Next time, a blow to the nerve plexus under the arm, here, will produce the effect I think you were looking for.
Ss'loka'.  It means literally "small but intelligent creature".  It loses much in the translation.
And what was that one about my mother?  That was a good one.
Ss'trokya ss'lato 'na'.
We were chasing you because you ran, you dumb son-of-a-bitch.
In the other man's rectum.
Why?
Please, I must get out here.
It's all right, George.  It's cool. Just wait here, all right?  I'll be back in a coupla minutes.
... So we've got three guys dead. All Newcomers, all killed the same way -- execution style.
The hell it isn't, when somebody wires up enough C-4 explosive to my car to turn me into pink mist!  That Slag was on something, and not sour milk, either?  Am I right?  TELL ME!  What is it?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
No... I am sure not.  That is why I am so concerned... someone must now be producing it here.  But none of my people know how to make it.  The process was carefully guarded.
With Harcourt and Kipling dead, I assume you will be requesting reassignment now.
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
How can I go?
What?
Movement!
I'll go.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
You did okay, Bishop.
You had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
Burke, just tell me one thing. That you're going out there to kill them.  Not study.  Not bring back.  Just burn them out...clean ...forever.
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
Look, we don't know what's going on out there.  It may just be a down transmitter.  But if it's not, I want you there...as an advisor.  That's all.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Yes, Hicks?
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They learned.  They cut the power and avoided the guns.  They must have found another way in, something we missed.
Locked.
Hey, Vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
You can't help them.  Right now they're being cocooned just like the others.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
Just terrible?  That's better than yesterday at least.
Newt.  Look at me...Newt.  I won't leave you.  I promise.
Isn't that how babies come? I mean people babies...they grow inside you?
Don't go!  Please.
Can we dream?
His Grace is very angry with you.
Good morning.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Yes.
Why not?
A brothel.
You were sublime.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
What is it?
Why? People fart backwards.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
They'll come anyway. They love me here.
Don't be stupid.
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
Stanzi-manzi, I'll put it in your hand!
Excellency!
He's terribly busy, sir.
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
I'm afraid I'm not at leisure this very moment. Just leave them with me. I assure you they will be quite safe.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
Originals?
Alone.
How much will you pay him?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
I see that you're expecting.
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
I think it is an interesting notion to keep Mozart in Vienna, Majesty. It should really infuriate the Archbishop beyond measure - if that is your Majesty's intention.
What a charming idea. May I see?
I don't think you understand me, Court Composer.
Of course not.
Oh, thank you.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
Well, what is it about? Tell us the story.
It is new, it is, isn't it, Sire?
What do you mean, Sire?
Bravo, Mozart. Most charming. Yes, indeed. Clever man.
Yes, Sire.
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
Well, what do you have for me today?
Is she not here?
How many pupils do you have?
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
Where does he work?
Where?
Sssh!
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Can I see it?
No.
Why not?
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
Good morning, Fraulein Schlumberg.
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
If a man cannot earn, he must borrow.
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
How fortunate.
Nine performances! Nine! That's all it's had - and withdrawn.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
Grazie, mio caro, Wolfgang!
Did my work please you?
Not here! She's not well, either. She went to the Spa.
So now the Confutatis. Confutatis Maledictis. When the wicked are confounded. Flammis acribus addictis. How would you translate that?
What time?
Third measure, second beat starting on E.  Flam-mis a-cri-bus ad-dic-tis.  And fourth measure, fourth beat - D.  Ma-le-dic-tis, flam-mis a-cri-bus ad- dic-tis.  Do you have that?
First bassoon and tenor trombone - what?
You go fast!
Yes.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
Can we see the scene with the music back, please?
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Herr Mozart -
You tried to take your life. You do remember that, don't you?
Do you understand that you have sinned? Gravely.
Where?
Oh, I know that! That's charming!  I didn't know you wrote that.
Did you try?
Yes, Father. Yes! So much for my vow of chastity. What did it matter? Good, patient, hard-working, chaste - what did it matter? Had goodness made me a good composer? I realized it absolutely then - that moment: goodness is nothing in the furnace of art. And I was nothing to God.
Yes.
Yes.
Incredible.
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
How did he look?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
He said 'Jack'.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Is David acting strangely?
Shall I send a car?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
What?
Yes?
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
What do you dream about?
I dream of death mostly.
How old are you?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Your dead friend Jack?
Alex?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Do me an enormous favor?
I've left those pills for you.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
I think he's a Jew.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
She's a jerk.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
Hello.
Nice looking group.
Right.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Thanks a lot.
It's you, David.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
What do you think?
Thank you.
Sorry, love.
Yes - sure—
Whose death?
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
Yes, sir.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
That don't do us any good.
What do you mean?
What is?
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals—  I think I will have a drink.
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
The butler said I could stay. I told him it was important.
Anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
Yes.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
That's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
I don't know.
Helen, tell Matt I want to see him.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
You haven't got a uniform?
No, sir.
No, I'm not Mr. Dickson!
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
I'm afraid I must, Mr. Dickson.
Why pick on him ?
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
What'll we do?
Mr. Dickson! Mr. Dickson!
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.
Hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
You're carrying too much money on you, Hank. You better turn some in tonight.
That mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
This is healing?
Yesterday.
Cole, I want to get to the farm, make sure Little Jim and the girls are okay.
But if we take their money and supplies...
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here...
You are a fine figure of a man.
He's been full of vinegar lately.
Perfect, Cole.
I got seven thousand.
Yep.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
I got us through the War all right.
Missed you, cousin.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
I have no idea what you just said, but it sounded real nice.
What?
You know you're welcome any time!
I reckoned.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
You know him?
Pinkertons. It's the railroad.
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
So what was he?
Riders --
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
Zerelda? Little Zee Mimms?
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
I beg your pardon?
I can't believe I had to blow up a train for you.
But I like the presidential suite.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Right here in church?
I guess so.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Really?
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
I see. I'll get together four patrols of our detectives for action tonight.
They exchanged fire with the Pinkerton Guards, killing several of them. Then they raided the payroll office and blew the tracks for half a mile.
With my money!
Sir?
Look at this, Pinkerton! They got the payroll, and this damage will set construction back two months at least.
Yes?
Pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
I'm ignoring you.
It's a plain end, see? So?
That's nice.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
You just haven't been looking.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time...
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
Do you know what Ed Gein said about women?
Are you sure?
You saw the ad in the Times?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
No, you...didn't?
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
It's definitely weak but I have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Do you have a boyfriend?
What's that?
So, what do you do?
No. Flattering, but no.
Well...
Uh huh?
Let's not get lewd.  I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
The disappearance of Paul Owen.
Understandable.  Lime?
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
You'll have to excuse me. I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.
Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball.  Call me Don.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
Where was Marcus?
I lost my job...
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Al.
Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you.
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break  Hmmm, I see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
So, wasn't Rothschild originally handling the Fisher account? How did you get it?
Yes, Owen?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
Teddy was killed last night.
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
They stop the construction work at six or seven. The parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. Even the early Geeks don't get there before five.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
Milo --
Don't worry, Milo. I'm here as a friend. Or maybe a supplicant.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
Conglomerates're lined up to finance the launch of the remaining satellites. They'll pay him a huge premium to get on-line.
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
When you get to a certain age, you start wondering. About your legacy. I doubt you even remember Outpost 1.0 --
Did you?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
I'm okay. It's going well!
No. I just went deeper into the machine. Preferred being the geek to having to explain. Lying would've been worse.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
You do?
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
It's only meaningful when you've got 40,000 lines of code to back it up.
...You wanna work -- here?
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Come with me.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
"There is no second place." Plus every time I get jammed-up, Gary has an inspiration.  Is it like that with your counselor?
Why would you do a thing like --
It's easy to know who the smart geeks are, the schools tell 'em. They upload medical files, school records, pharmacy files. They'd be happy just to steal code forever. But when a program gets close to fruition. Like Teddy. He was almost there.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
What about the FBI?
Do we post it on the Net?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
A what?
I felt guilty. 'Cause I "owed so much" to Alice. But even then I was starting to wonder. Is it so great to be so consumed by this one thing that you let another person do your thinking for you? If you have a lucrative skill, it's all anybody wants from you. You grow older but you don't grow up. You turn into -- into --
The dishes are juiced up, too.
He suspects I know something. I think he was sort of -- explaining himself to me, in case I do.  We have to go in tonight. I'm two hours from a Beta version.  But I've gotta go home for an hour.
Meet me at the other location.
Bring it to the other location.
What? Come on. Is it serious?
I don't know.
What d'you mean?
We tried the big vaporware number, Gary, it's no-sale.
Is it about my teeth?
Austin Powers? Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.
We know all that, Exposition.
Where am I?
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Vanessa's one of our top agents.
Oh, and Austin...
Yes?
Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up to speed. Dr. Evil has high- jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars. If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world.
What?
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Do I make you horny?
Why did you leave so soon?
Why?
How do you know?
I haven't had fun like that since college.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
Kiss me.
Here, have a piece of gum.
Don't mind if I do.
Shut up.
But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Quite impressive.
Yes, what is it? You're interrupting my moment of triumph.
Right.
No, the boy's right. I really am evil.
An evil vet?
An evil petting zoo?
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
How's Austin?
Of course not. I was married to your father.
You didn't answer my question, Mum.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Sir August Merryweather? I was looking for something relaxing. Say, a Tuscan hillside in June?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Black...
Flower ...
Secret ...
Then who wins?
Father will be your controller. Steed here will show you the ropes.
Welcome to mobile H.Q. Weather's turning quite nasty. Sir August was blown to smithereens. Along with half of Banffshire.  The Ministry's worried.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
Too many cooks --
'Our revels now are ended.'
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
I was about to throw in the towel.
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
Much better.
But why? What's the point?
Sir August Merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
No thanks.
Strange.
Perhaps your memory plays tricks, Mrs. Peel.
Colonel Crabtree. International Satellite Systems. Formerly of the Ministry.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Was I?
No trouble.
And do you trust me?
I'm playing to win.
Bad news. Father's looking for you. Where are those bloody ministers?
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Now let's see ... Eton, Cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. Overtaken by Peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
Where?
Ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
Cole...
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
I don't want any trouble.
The best.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Yes I did.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Are you going to have women at your party?
What's the matter?
Can't I just go with you guys?
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
Yeah.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Ilene, are you crazy?
What are you talking about, asshole?
Your whores never showed up.
That's it, prick lips.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Yes.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
Is that all the coke in the place?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Oops!
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
The phone made me do it!
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Oooooo.
Debbie.
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Oh these moments do try me...
It works.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
Thanks.
This?
Hey, what are you doing here?
I saw it.
I saw Adcox's back! I saw the burn! I put it there! Jesus Christ, Stephen, he's been killing people!
How do you know?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
You're his Lt., Stephen...  Are you gonna handle it? Are you Stephen?
You look great.
Uh... I've been sorta keeping a low profile... the academy... I graduated today.
Really? No kidding.
Arson.
Hey...  So are you dating your boss or what?
You think that's really any of your business?
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Homey.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Oh Jesus Christ...
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
If you remember, sir, my test scores were in the top --
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Well Brian, I guess you can say it's arson now...
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Engine 115, right?
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
You crooked son of a bitch. Why 115?
What?
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
I'm busy.
He's got piano lessons.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
Didn't think you'd make it.
Tell him about me, Shadow?
Yes.
That stuff'll kill you quick, man.
How are you doing, man?
Me?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
I don't got it. Not tonight. You can't get blood from a stone.
He's gonna kill you, man. Do you hear me, motherfucker? You. Dead. Get it?
How's the case going?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
YEAH!
Give me some?
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Hook you up?  The Mau-Mau's?  You must be smoking.  Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
What do you do?
You might be right.
What's that?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Chill, I'm the brains behind this outfit.
Manray, Sloan says you're too talented to be dancing on the street.
My tap shoes.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I'm an oreo, a sell out?  Because I don't aspire to do HOMEBOYS FROM OUT OF SPACE, SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER, A PJ's or some as you might put it, some "nigger" show?  I'm a Tom?  I'm whiter than white and you're blacker than black? Is that what you think?
Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right.
Word!!!
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Exactly!
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
I don't know about that plantation angle.
I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
What do you want?
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
Nobody told me anything.
It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money.
Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous.
A gift.
Why'd you do that?
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
Please don't go there.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Don't make me have to use this.
My name is Manray, goddamnit.
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
He wants you to come and see him.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
Regardless, he still is your father.
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother?
Yes you!
Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this?
Money and nothing else?
No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better.
You tellin' the truth.
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...perfect...
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
How be dat?
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
What else?
You don't read, do you?
What?
Aw, c'mon.
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Good day to you, young sir.
Where are you bound for?
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Your honor must lower his voice.
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
For whom else have you worked?
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Then you yield to me.
No.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
How so?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Will we always leave it at this?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Is he all right, papa?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He is only curious to know who you are.
He loves me, as I love you.
Can I at least have a drink?
A target, Kendall, cap a fucking target. What's wrong with you?
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
C'mon, Ray, everyone hates the Army during Basic. I'll tell you straight, I hated it here.
And those were the guys who went on the exercise with you?
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
Epilepsy.
Back up.
Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Jesus, what happened?
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
Whose blood is that, Jay?
Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me.
From up close or far away?
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...
They?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
Is it the truth?
How do you know?
Where are they!
Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
You mean not enough to save you.
You think you could explain all this to me?
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
That's preposterous --
Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital -- you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Move him.
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
That was kid gloves?
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
I didn't shoot West...
What?
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
Mueller. He's as bad as West and we both know it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm tied up, but we get the others to go along --
Poor fucker my ass...
Pike and I got separated --
No one else heard it?
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
You are to be stripped of all weapons and placed under guard --
He asked to see a policeman, we're getting him a policeman.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Who is she? Where does she live?
What do you mean? You don't even know me.
Sure I do. You were hot shit back in Hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. You don't have a plan. You don't have a job. You don't have anything but the clothes on your back.
What is this place?
I brought it.
Not that one. The real story. Did he ever tell you that?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
Please. Go. Just go.
Lucky girl.
That's terrible.
Really?
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
You know where the chemicals are?
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Like this.
Oh.
How can I convince you to stop?
It's me. Norther Winslow.
'Fraid so.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
You didn't become crazy.
I'm going to check on him.
You're not.
What happened?
How did you get here?
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
Of course.
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Yes.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Josephine and I have a lot in common.
So you never bought any land.
Yeah it was okay.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were good.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
What's wrong?
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Why not?
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
And who says what is wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Sometimes neither.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
You are throwing me out.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I don't know.
Goodbye.
Why?
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
You didn't have to do this.
This was very sweet of you.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Why you stop havin' dancin' on Saturday? Used to have bands... all kind's live shit. Like a wake up in here, now.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Jes? Jesse?  Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
Thought you had a skirt earlier.
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Better?
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
If you come to talk about that muthafucka, I'm gonna get up and leave you sittin' pretty in that new suit he bought'cha.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Rose. Folks get sick. But you do what you can to get on the mend. Our marriage... it just got sick. That's all.
I keep the heat on.
Rose... please...
If we get with a counselor. At the church, maybe they's...
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
Take it easy now. Don't rush it.
You been in and out goin' on two... maybe two days.
Where's Ronnie?
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
LET ME GO!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
My Daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. That's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. Know why it's best to rotate em like that?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Don't think that'd be wise.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
I don't want you to let go.
Huh?
See, that girl is in my favor. You heard me, nigga? You fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
Like I say, you wanna hook that up... I ain't in ya way. That switch of hers been all over this town. Got that sickness, you know.
Naw!
You gonna preach 'bout turnin' the other cheek?
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Or what?
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's between her and me. It's private. And I don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
What's on your mind?
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Are you wasted?
Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody...
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
You want a popsicle, go to Good Humor.  And don't call me 'pappy.'
What's this?
Why?
What are they doing now?
Nick... You up?
Go to sleep, Charlie.
Nick, we can't just --
Squid?
What does Charlie mean?
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
I've continued working on the case!
What'd I tell you?
Gaiijin.
Big enough.
Nick, you can't do this.
Start it.
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Where's the wife?
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
She's such a long way home for you.
One guy do all the damage?
You're foreigners.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
Our associates in New York were close to closing a deal with us.
The Feds would be onto you in a month.
That wasn't our deal.
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
Why?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Like what?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
No.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why, yes, of course.
You start.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Vodka!
Thank you very much.
Those cockroaches?
You like to kiss her goodbye.
My birthday is April 10, 2015. How long do I live?
From what I hear you're doing great.  Bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  Making a lot of money, huh?
These aren't just...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Yes?
The girl that doesn't look like that girl.
What's suck night?
Yeah?
Like to get this position.  Did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
Sorry.
Me.
Why should I be?
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Me and my dad.
How come you're not on the job?
Nobody is freer than when he dreams.  I read that.
Ten years.
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Well?
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
What?
Beautiful.
This is my new friend...
Your mom was a dancer?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Oh, that's nice.
So far?
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
It's Perry!
Perry?
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
How's that?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Take it. damn it!
Why are you doing that?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Name it.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
A wife?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Could we talk about that a little later?
Stop that ma'am crap!
I told you I've never driven before!
Sure.
All right.
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I thought I was here to meet women.
Okay. I like that.
That's ridiculous.
Adam?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Really?  Okay!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
What?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Like one of Mom's?
Then why go there?
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
I promise. Is that all?
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
Uh, I think they have.
This must be very new.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
I just don't want to.
What?
Up there!!
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Elbows, Son.
Dad!
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll be all right.
Well, where are you --
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
What about relatives?
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Thirty -five years!
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
What?
I've noticed.
If I...you know...
Calvin!
Get the presents and do the lights.
If we still have one.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Always good advice.
What's it to you?!
To bed.
To bed?
Or have perfect table manners.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
What?!
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
To your health, Frank.
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
It must be great.
Jeffrey?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?
Okay.
Anything you can tell me?
Only you and the photo lab.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Jeffrey nothing.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
How'd you like it if someone sneaked into your house and watched you.  Get undressed. I want to see you.
No. Come on.
Do you like talk like that?
No.
Sure I'm alright. 
No. What is happening?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Do you love me?
Sometimes I think I do.
Men are crazy. Then they put their craziness into me. Then it makes me crazy. Then they aren't so crazy for awhile. Then they put their craziness in me again.  It's burning me, but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
I guess I should go.
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Hello, daddy.
Hey Tits, I'm taking your neighbor to the country. Maybe something for you too.
You want to see him too, right?
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
No thanks.
Go where?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Yeah, how did you know?
That's too bad.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Are you alright?
I owe you, since I goofed up this one.
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
What's the plan.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Are you sure?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
You want to tell me about it?
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
You worry about me really?
Where to?
It's okay.
I can't dance fast.
No.
Dorothy Vallens?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Needed an outsider. The package boy knows everyone. He'd spot our hitters a mile away.
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Are ya ready?
Look under the body.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
What are you saying?
You think they sold me out? No way.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
No. No man. That's... that's... you don't know what you're talking about. That's bullshit. I know these guys. I mean, thanks for your concern, but that just ain't the thing of it.
Oh man. You gotta let me do these guys. I'm such a moron. I gotta make up for the tit thing.
No way. I've been waitin' for this asshole.
Forget it. It's a family prayer. My father, his father before him that sort of shit.
Shit.
What?! What are you doin'?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
We... met them last night.
So you're telling me it was one guy with six guns? A-and he was a senior fucking citizen?
Be careful.
Oh, Jesus.
I gave him his first lesson in sensitivity toward the fairer sex just today.
"What do we tell him about the guns and money?"
"We just got up and left. Bum musta rolled them before the police got there."
Yeah, these guys always got a lot of rope strapped around em in the movies and they always end up using it.
Oh, you've lost it, haven't ya?
I'm serious.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
We're doing some serious shit here. Now, get a hold of yourself, asshole.
He isn't to be touched.
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
What about one guy with two guns?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Chief, what the fuck is this?
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
How many bodies, Greenly?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
But he's been havin' himself a nip or two as well... Been up the waitress' skirt all night, poor girl.
Right now.
What are you serious?
Fuck it! What kind of flowers ya want at your funeral? Ya dumb Wop. This is the last time I'll see you. Bye-bye ya stupid son of a bitch.
Hey, Murph.
Roc. You okay?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
Worst day of my life, man.
You believe?
Yes.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I believe these young men are right.
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Have you no fear of God?
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
OK. That's wrong.
Did you see what I meant about the window?
That's true. But what if they change the locks?
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Is it back in?
You think we're going to be chased?
Calm down. Take a deep breath.
What about what that guy said?
Because my mom gets the bill.
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
She's from Cuba.
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
Our money situation is not good.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
I want you to look at this.
It's big, Anthony. Real big. It's called Hinckley Cold Storage.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
OK. Mark that down.
Go ahead, Bird Dog.
We all set?
What's happening? What's going on?
Freeze!
Who tripped the alarm?
You're kidding.
So is Mr. Henry going to come by and see me or anything?
He did?
I'm not kidding.
Does it float?
Nice to meet you.
Yes, he did.
No, that door over there.
Are you afraid?
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome.  I love palindromes.
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
Let them fight.
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
No, I'm having a heart attack. Of course, I'm OK. What's that supposed to mean?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
That sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
Yeah.
What's he doing here?
Yes. I did.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I think we might of scared her.
You know, Bob, Anthony did kill someone. He electrocuted our janitor senior year.
It was an accidental. I don't want to go into the details. It was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. I mean, obviously, since Swifty's dead. That's why Anthony never graduated.
What are you doing?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
I don't know.
I'm going back.
Watch me.
What is it?
Dignan.
He's having a heart attack or something.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
How's that 700 bucks coming?
And what does that cover?
Ground defense.
Join the party, fellas.
Mr. Henry?
There was a mistake.
I want to know about Treadstone.
I want to know what happened.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
What?
Did he say anything to you?
Sit down.
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Sit. Can you...  [The chair. Have the chair.]
Conklin.
Who sent you to Greece?
I'm sorry.
I'll get the book.
No. There's nothing new.
No... How?
That's crazy.
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
Yes.
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
My first job.
Where am I?
Sounds like a threat.
You didn't answer my question.
Me? Four years.
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
You mean, did I want a date?
Is it fresh?
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Someone dead from this household?
I don't want to leave.
Peace?!
Wallace has sacked York!
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
No, M'lord.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
Good to see you again.
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He broke because of me. I saw it. He lost all will to fight.
No. He did not.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
It matters not, he is thy king!
I'm not just saying it!
I'm dreaming.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
And I with you. But you must wake.
How do you know this?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
A meeting in a barn. It had to be a trap. And only you would know I would be aware of it.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I am trying.
What?
Anything.
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so I wanted to wear my clothes but Mr. Miller took his shirt off --
So how's Tommy?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
It was a long time ago.
Where... where are my clothes?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
Why's that?
Yeah?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
I just thought you should know.
Know what?
There's one major hole in your story.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
I don't get it.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
But it didn't. And now I need info to make things right again and you're the only one who can give it to me.
You're kidding. Are these the answers?!
Smells like sex in here.
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. You see the way Evan's mom was looking at you?
He did. Captain Renault did.
Yes, Monsieur.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Yes, something.
And Mademoiselle?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I will.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
I don't know the finish yet.
How did you get in?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Put them on the table.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
And I said I would never leave you.
Goodnight.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Hello, Rick.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
No. It's all arranged.
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
Manages what?
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
What friend?
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Have you taken leave of your senses?
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
Uh huh.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
There seems to be no secret about that.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
No.
No. Not me, boss.
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.
Just a little something of my own.
It's bad.
No.
If they can't see you, what's the point?
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
What are you smiling about?  They'll be back.
Oh?  You've tried?
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
I had it on the island with me.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
This isn't working out.
That's your dog.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
Is that Jango?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
What was inside?
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
When's the next Jumbo?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
Yes, yes he did.
You are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
I've got all this back pay coming.  Why don't you let me get you a place in town?
It is Ibrim, I, I am a sorter.
Look, I'm sorry about your plane.  But I couldn't risk being late into Memphis.
That's why you're a gambling man.
For the third time.
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
To life.
He'll need clothes... some money...
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
He mentions Homer, too, you know.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
So, Mrs...
What's the *medical* explanation?
You don't miss it?
That's what *I'd* come here for. I'd watch the movie.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
I know, I'm sorry.
Please don't...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
I'm okay--I can walk.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
I don't remember.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Please listen to me! *Both* of you...
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Where'd she get you?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
There was no visible wound?
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
I thought it was my turn.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Mind your own business, Peaches.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
Where do you think you're going?
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Rose Rose has runned away!
Tough day?
Right. The guys who started that did what a lot of companies in the Valley do. They get a good idea, shop it around, raise some capital, then sell it off to a bigger company. Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, whatever. The beauty of it is, they've pretty much sold the company before they're even real. The bigger company is already set to buy it, all they want to do is make sure that the idea actually works. So they get some start up capital, make it work, then sell it for like five times the initial loan.
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
Things are probably going to end badly for you, Jake.
Your life flashing before your eyes?
You never know when you can use a crooked cop.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Currently, the King Pin is a very large-type pole stuck up our asses.
Independent. Same shit, just independent. They call him the King Pin because he looks like that guy from the comic book... Big. Fat. Bald.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Fuck that. We're going too.
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
How much we going after?
We meet him with corporate papers, inquiring about a corporate loan for start up capital. The corporate papers are in order, but we need things to happen fast. Our guy fudges numbers in the right places, moves our papers to the top of the pile or to the bottom, depending upon what we need.
Uh... No thanks. I'm not going all the way to Brooklyn for a hundred dollar pay-off.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
Eight A.M. flight.
Jake --
Here and there, Scooter? Here and there like Boston, Chicago, Houston? The bay area? Some action in London, 'til it turned nickel and dime. Or how about that little stint down in Miami? Heard you actually got into some trouble with the Feds down there. You guy's pretty good?
No thanks. I'm good.
Don't get me wrong, Jake. I like you boys. You guys are the steadiest business in town. But what can I say? Twenty percent's still better than what we give to any of the other criminals.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Kennedy. International terminal. Gordo with a black suitcase. You got Moonan under control?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
Oh Jesus!
What -- What do we do?
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
What about Customs?
Why?
You told me to change my hair!
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
Not the way I did it. I was loaded half the time. I don't know how you could change bedpans sober. I used to hang out with this guy, Glenn. He was an x-ray technician or something.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
Do we want insurance?  I'm just asking...
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
What do we need another Shill for?
What?
Yeah, or D, it's a dumb fucking idea...
Yeah, well we never had this kind of problem before.
We're getting a little old for running.
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
I'm sorry.
You going to have the time?
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
What happened?
Try and keep up... You ask for the Advantage Goods, then you guys come in looking to be Bean Traps. So I gotta think you're either working the mace or playing the Jug Mob.
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
Then who's the Banker?
Ten percent.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Good... I gotta go.  So, what do you have for me?
What kind of deal you looking to?
Eight-fifty.
What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
I get it.
I. sold the car.
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
You're my prisoner.
I've got a job.
Tension. It'll go.
I take it back. You're not a cop any more. You're a store detective.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
It's the truth.
I hope it brings you luck.
That girl, she works at the casino --
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
Great.
I'm sorry, madam, we don't accept gratuities in the UK. It's different in South Africa.
Oh hello.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
It can only work with amateurs, A pro would have spotted it.
I'm in trouble.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
Would you like a drink?
Have I?
I'm Lucy.
You've done pretty well.
Just girls. What are you drinking?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.  You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
How many aces are left?
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
What flickering light?
Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!
It didn't go off.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Armed.
Huh?
I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
I am always receptive to suggestions.
Hmm... Well, I think, therefore I am.
Exactly.
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
That's it.
To explode, of course.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
...you may be doing so on the basis of false data.
I have no proof that it was false data.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
Yeah, Doolittle. What's up?
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
Yes, Talby, what is it?
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Before we get too far away, and our signals start to fade, I just wanted to tell you... you were my favorite. I really liked you, Doolittle.
Commander, sir, we have a big problem. You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won't drop from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in --  -- less than eleven minutes.
What were you saying, Commander, about the bomb?
We're running out of time, sir.
Men... men... what happened, men?
Who are you?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
None of your business.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Can I say something in my defense?
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
I don't get involved with guns.
I made you coffee.  That oughta help you cope with the injustice of the world a little.
He's a mistake I made about six months before you did.  But don't feel bad. Justine made the same mistake, along with Renee, Jada, Tia, Brooke--
I know.
Can you help me get her back?
I don't want to move away.
But why can't we stay here?
I was expecting someone else.
Whoever that is.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
One of my sources.  Her husband was murdered by Edgar Sonrisa.
People had a choice, even if they took it for granted.  And now they don't.
Personally, I'm more interested in going fast on my motorcycle or climbing the Trans American building with my pals. Instead of giving myself a headache over stuff I can't do anything about.
Ever notice how cats always seem to turn up around dinner time?
How much do you know?
Your basic hodge-podge.
Christmas is a snap when you got no parents or relatives, just a bunch of gene sequences from probably twenty different people.
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
That's low, but this effects me how exactly?
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
What's this?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
This is not a place you wanna go.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
You know what I'm saying.
Unlikely.
Only one I can think of.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Tell everybody hey.
You left out condescending.
--a philandering pig.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Easy Sketchy.
She's toxic...monster in bed, but toxic.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I don't sleep... Theo asked me to pick up his check.
Fourteen-thirteen Market.  Get a signature, then take it to this address... By the way, that guy who was in here sniffing after you yesterday called twice already.
Thanks, miss.
Right, well, thanks for the drinks and stuff, Amanda, but there's no reason for me to stick around these parts anymore.
What's that?
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Jeremiah?
I didn't mean for that to be so... intense. Forgive me.
Ann Arbor?
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What's it worth to you?
I'm starvin' and it's way past lunchtime.
What's in Sandusky?
We are not stealing my mom's car.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
I found the Volvo.
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
Are you on the crapper with one of those antenna phones? Sounds like you're taking a dump the size of Butte, Montana.
All right. After school we double- time it to your house for the tix before heading to the train station for the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City.
It was stolen!
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.
Yeah, right. She wishes. Look at that big ass.
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
The Chinese have a proverb: "That which appears too good to be true, usually is." There's gotta be a catch.
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
GOOD MORNING!
Yeah.
So... that's it?
That's not what I heard. Now they think I did it.
So... you just moved here?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
No... I mean, will you GO with me? That's like... what they call it here. Going together.
Yeah?
Will you please talk to me?
Hey. You OK?
What?
Come with me.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
You're such a fuck-ass.
I wish I knew where you went at night.  Did you toilet paper the Johnson's house?
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
Donnie Darko, perhaps, given your recent brush with mass destruction, you can give us your opinion?
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
He said to follow him.
Follow him where?
So, tell me about your day, Donald.
How does that make you feel?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
I... I was playing with fire.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
You've done it again?
Where is he, Donald?
It's called "The Philosophy of Time Travel".
Yeah... well, that's not the way the world works. If you keep being too honest, the world will eventually find a way to destroy you.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Thank you for seeing us... We... just felt that it was time to discuss...
Donnie is experiencing what is commonly called a daylight hallucination.
Frankie Feedler. You remember him from high school?
Chut up!
Wicked.
Mommmm! I'll be right behind you in the hearse!
I heard you, I was just tryin' to scare you into changin' your mind. Oh for Chrissakes, Amber, the woman clung to your tap shoes while flyin' through the air like a Goddamn lawn dart!
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
Airport Ho-Jo!
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
That's it, I'm goin'...
Bye mom.
But, doesn't someone taking your costume so you can't compete, overrule that rule?
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Why don't you paint a big red target on your ass, Loretta.
Oh for chrissakes, everything smells like that in Mexico.
What?
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
That's enough!
Nothin' too showy!
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
Oh! What is it?
Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?" Are we on "Cops?"
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
No! We not like to hear it! Go to your room and shut up!
He should be king!
They'll know I mean business then they get that letter...  see that that gets out immediately and that goes for you too.
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
He used to be a bloodhound but he's anemic --
What do you whistle?
That was for you.
Then you don't wanna work hard?
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Not a bad idea.  If our horses get tired they can ride your men for a change.  Now, I don't mind letting you have our horses, but you must promise to put them through their maneuvers.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
Fine.  We'll throw in the matches before we make the delivery.  By the way, how're you fixed for spys?
Sure.
Oh, Your Excellency, isn't there something I can do?
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
Excellency, may I present my niece.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
I want him back!
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then?
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Treves. Well done.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
I feel much better. Thank you.
...everyone has been very kind.
Three quarters of an hour.
Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Good day...!
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. I just work there.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
What's this?
The main spire.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Mmmerrick.
The hospital?
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Who are they of?
Oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.
Oh no, I couldn't.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
No, John, not one that I can see.
Won't come out, eh?
He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
And who might you be, sir?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
Well... where is he?
There is no magic, Father... My mother had no magic...
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
We never went to bed together.
I've never LOVED anybody!
Just give me a hand.
Yes -- I believe you do.
Erik! You've done what you came to do!
Then I shall come too.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
Don't talk nonsense.
Is there something the matter with it?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
Well you started it.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
Scream.
Ah.
But...
What's wrong with making friends?
But. You're not even afraid of DEATH, Thorfinn!
What's it all about?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
You must help us.
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Just say something cheerful.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
She hasn't got any.
He used to puke in his sleep.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Get away, Snorri.
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
It's not just YOUR livelihood that's at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of ALL blacksmiths.
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
Together we stand!
I know, Dad.
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
There is nothing we can do...
Easy, Dad!
Well... I'm game.
Thorfinn! You can't die!
And keep your sword greased.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
I'm sure you would.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Yeah.
Sort of, um...
Take care.
Frost?
It's pretty.
Thanks.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
Yeah?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
No, not at all.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Tomorrow?
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Where are you going?
Let's talk about it later.
More?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
No.
You remember what happened next?
What?
Yeah.
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
We did talk about Naomi.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
You said...
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
You know what I did.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
yeah?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
I think, before.
It's dark.
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Bye, Joel.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Have sex. Y'know --
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Hi, it's Joel.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
I miss you.
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
See you later, alligator.
You found us okay?
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
And after that?
Hi.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Is everything getting worse?
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
You're political, then?
Extraordinary!
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
I have to go, Julian.
Thanks.
Are you in show business?
You're the best?
Captain Miller, we're ready to repressurize the Clark.
Solid as a rock.  Hey, Smith...
He'll live... if we ever make it back.
What's happening...?
I've got a pulse, he's alive...
I wouldn't bring you here on a hoax. Houston confirms the telemetry and I.D. codes.
Thank you.
You're not seriously considering sending him?
We've got pressure.
Alive?
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
Any survivors?
We barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can't stop the drain, we're not gonna make it.
What do you want me to say?
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
What about my ship?
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
But...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Carbon dioxide?
I'll do it --
We're armed. This fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we're armed...
Foredecks. Crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. That central section connects the forward decks to the Engineering containment area. Can we move in closer?
What the hell is that?
Relativity, yes. We can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. The ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
Yes. I miss her. She died. Two years now.
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
I wouldn't know anything about that.
It's easy for you to be patient.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Ben?
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
The shields on the station should protect us.
'Course not. Strictly business.
Hey! That's a prototype!
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
This is wrong in so many ways.
Not only could you kill yourself, but you could set fire to Earth's atmosphere and destroy all human life as we know it.
That's what I'm trying to calculate. And it's not rubber. It's muscle, tendon. I seem to have the ability to manipulate the malleability of my molecular structure and redistribute my density to --
But all these people...
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Johnny? Did you see Ben?
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
That's what we're here to find out.
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
But I'm not done with the machine --
I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to --
Please don't make this personal --
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Are you still a virgin?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
Did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Get a ride with somebody.
Are you really a virgin?
You first.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Damone! You come here?
Well, I've gotta be running.
And... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
Yes.
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
First he's gonna shit. And then he's gonna kill us.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Does that ever happen?
How long does Doug take?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
I paid for it and everything.
He's not coming.
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Food will be eaten on your time!  Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
You better save some for me, you swine!
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
What can I get for you tonight.
It's very warm out tonight.
We keep them.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Where's Mike today?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
Nobody noticed. Don't worry about it. We'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
What about the notes?
Hi, Stacy. How are you?
Yeah? About fifty people I didn't know wrote that in my annual.
Are you sure there's nothing else I can bring you?
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Killed?
Don't worry. You're protected. Just treat this poor woman like you'd treat any other human being in trouble.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
What do you mean by that?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Maybe thirty more minutes. As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed. It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal. Are you ready for that? Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Why?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
Not much. Why?
I have to go.
Yes. Leave the country. Tonight.
That depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
Where'd you get that knife?
Jesus.
What?... What kind of goddamn monster are you?
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this. Not hundreds of them!
This is a fucking nightmare.
They just ran back out into Death Valley -- you know, where Manson turned up...
Adrenochrome...
No! I can't get out! They'll crucify me. I'll have to take the blame!
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
I will not die because of him!
Oh!
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
We just smeared a skunk.
That's an unwise thing to say, you know that?
So, what now? Did those things leave?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What? Really?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
Sit still, look less like a meal.
Clever fuckers.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Am I too heavy for you?
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
She's still alive, I hope. I wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for the chance of seeing my little girl again. I need to get to her.
My clothes?
Good, good. Give them that.
Frances.
Who?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
I know that, Dad, but --
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
Please, Francie...
You're poisoning that child's mind.
No, Lil. It's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.
Just one minute...
Well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
Don't be a rat, Harry.
You don't know what you want.
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
I know what ability you're interested in.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
No, Harry, I can't -- 
Take a walk, pal.
You know something, Harry?
I guess.
Hey, you're a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can't go a route of ground.
Frances, You're crazy.
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
I'm not sure.
No.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
And no people.
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
What happened? Who're you?
I need an incendiary! An arsonist!
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
Well, who have we here...?
I think I need a little air.
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
On behalf of the Seattle Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration --
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
I see.
This whole thing is a joke!
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Huh?
What is that to you? Evil as you are.
Nice.
People can be kinder than you think.
What of my soul? Do I have one? Or was that a part you left out?  Who were these people of which I am comprised? Good people? Bad people?
Materials. Nothing more.
Trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
Soon?
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
This feels... incestuous.
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you really think I'm mad?
That's blasphemy!
Victor. This has got to stop.  Nobody's seen you in months. You haven't attended a single class.
I've been preoccupied.
For what?
What happened up there?
You seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
You're awake. I've prepared some broth. It'll help restore you.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
I can't say I blame them. We're trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
Creature? A... human like creature?
You know of it?
It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.
I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten. If you're still up, we can talk, okay?
I don't hear it anymore.
Jack?
Marcie?
Somebody's there, Barry.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?
What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter?
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
Don't call him.
It's just a dream.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
You can't, but fifteen percent instead of thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.
I said new, this is an '90.
Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
Not a chance.
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
No, I didn't.
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
What did you call me?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
What?
Yes.
Yeah.
Watch my back!
I'm sorry.
This can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.
Hot goddamn day!
What the hell would I do with that grease pit? Besides, Nadine's got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about that bank robbery in Abilene, didn't ya?
Best in Mexico.
What the fuck was that about?
Do they have a waterbed?
She's in the other room.
Richard!
They're gonna search the van.
Keep your voice down.
I'm curious. What was the nuttiest thing I did?
This ain't the time.
Yeah, we were just standing there. You said something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.
That's what I hear.
Just a friend.  We have friends, too, you know.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Sir?  What did he say?
Only blanks.  Lemme do it.
Think I overplayed it?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat.  Or, actually, its official non-policy.  Now who's your immediate superior there?
Would I be the only one?  The only woman?
Did you set me up?  Did you set me up just to see me fail?
In face, I do:  Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
You'll think about my offer?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Not doin' them very fine, O'Neil.
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world.  The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system.  Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice.  Where's The Polk?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
Just like you would be.
Well, you're doin' shit-hot at Intel.
You're such a ball-breaker sometimes.  Especially at night.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
"In Washington..."
And how do you know that?
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell...
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything.
First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you?
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours?
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil?
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
I just wonder how that happened.
O'Neil, Jordan.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Even tough I don't talk to her every day -- I still talk to her every day.  Know what I mean?
Shut up. How can you eat like that?
I'm telling you he's dirt. He's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
What?
All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
Animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
So you made it.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
You never said it was off the record.
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
This is not the place...
Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it?
No, but I have the feeling I'm about to find out.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
Somebody must have seen it.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Why are you telling this to me?
I need you to trust me.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Uh uh! What did we talk about?
Quellek. What are you doing in there?
I avoided capture using the Mak'tar stealth haze.  Where is everyone?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
Don't speak, Quellek.
I'm glad you asked... To me the most important qualities of a Galaxy Explorer are loyalty...
There it is. The Beryllium sphere.
Go ahead!
Nothing.
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.
May I get the check?
I don't know.
Commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and I are having. In "The Quasar Dilemma", the Sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Brandon, I remember you from the convention, right?... You had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and I spoke sharply to you...
Okay, we got it.
No, wait, are you-
There is no weather in space.
Systems register functional.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Where are the miners?
I am SO SICK of being right.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
There's nobody here. Jason...
How does the rolling help, actually?
Jason.. Can you hear me?
never doubted you for a second.
Unbelievable.
You know, that's really getting annoying.
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
Then how did he find out about the device?
But there it is!...
But...Why?
You said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
Okay, I'll do this...  "Caw Caw!"
Okay... On what?
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
What's your frank estimation of the British?
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Me?  You apologizing to me?
No, my lord.
By red, what rank would you say this black, officer, soldier is, Colonel?
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
Captain, I want you to know that I respect your openness.  It would make me happy if you'd join our table for dinner from now on.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yes, I believe so.
Washington is perfect.  He's a Southerner, he's a war hero and he's rich!
We already have black soldiers in our army...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
However, through my relations with members of his majesty's court, I am a representative of the French government whose deepest desire is to be one people, united with our American brothers in arms to defeat the rapacious armies of King George of England.  Vive la France!  Vive l'Amerique!
I only meant...
Like flowers after the snow melts.
"Liberty, Virtue, Country"... That's from Cato... you know, that play about the noble Romans?  As I was riding up to Philadelphia, I found myself thinking about the old days...
I think I heard that.
What else?  From Virginia?
Some things must never change.
I want you to see our hospital.
The only way to get discipline into these men is to beat it into them! Fifty lashes each!
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
Well, this must be about something!
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
Do you?  When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
What are you doing?
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
I have to ask you for that key.
About sixty.
Maybe your nephew panicked, took off.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?
Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than "Lovejoy".
I need the money.
What money?
How 'bout I give you to three, then I organize your fuckin' brains all over the wall back there. One...
What, you gonna shoot me now, Bo?
In just a second. Two...
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
She's great. Gimme the money.
I don't know.
Yeah, I'm here. I just don't like the anonymous crap. It means your either chickenshit or not for real.
I checked the bag at the airport, when I came.
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before -– I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was -– forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Get in line, bro.
You live in Miami?
That's right.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Maybe a few times I have.
Because I need half a million to buy a script.
What's it called?
Just a thought.
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
What do you get out of this?
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
What?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.
Who?
You got a miss. Leo Devoe. Guy's six weeks over.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
How about this?
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
I'm up twelve grand today.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
...That's what we finally decided.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
I got you a copy of the script.
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
I think you could be an actor. I know you're acting sometimes, but you don't show it.
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
You bet.
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
I'm going into the movie business.
I have to run. But what I hope to see, they begin to have misgivings about wanting the money. It becomes their moral dilemma and they try to rationalize keeping it, but in the end they can't. Can they?
Lufkin. His... agent.
Roger, North Island. Please advise pending further information. Over.
What?
If you get it back in one piece.
The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
But how long?
It's a hell of a lot of money.
Don't fall asleep.
I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
What'd you find up there?
Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Murphy to Epps.
How's he doing?
"The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
"Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made."
But where's the damage?
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Maybe hallucination is the wrong word. It was more than that. As though they were showing me.
Nope.
Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
And now you're gonna kill me, is that it?
I don't give a damn about the gold.
Yeah.
Murphy, goddamit.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Maybe Epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
Never been more thirsty in my life.
You don't remember?
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
Will you get off my back for once?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Well, I think it's good to keep all your options open. You can always enroll for the winter quarter.  You could even live here and go to the city college part time, and still get a job if you wanted to.
Did I tell you who I ran into at the bagel place?
Who?
Guess.
Not the Maxine?
I've got some important news to tell you, but it can wait till later if you're not feeling...
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Huh?
Aren't there a million places like this?
Hi Josh.
I just stopped in to say hi.
Oh, hi...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Why not?
Uh oh... don't turn around...
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Much later.
Or maybe not.
Hi, Al!
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit?  Here we go...  "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
Why do I always have to do it?
I want to "make love" to him.
Not really...
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Where are we going?
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
That guy is totally amazing.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You're insane.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
Hello?
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
There.
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
What time?
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
Well, we won't keep you.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
Well why do I care about that?
Yeah, well...
Maybe I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests.  I hate my interests! Where can I go to meet the exact opposite of myself?
So is that your boyfriend?
I don't think so...
So, why did you bring this along?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Now I remember why I haven't gone anywhere in months. I'm not even in the same universe as those creatures back there. I might as well be from another planet.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh yeah?
Why?
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
I had to see you.
Uh... sure... come in.
Uh... I think there's some root beer...
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
Oh yeah... and Dana...  You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
I really want to talk to you. I've been thinking about what you said about moving in here...
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Please Josh?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Why would she be hiding from me?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
What are you talking about?
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
The next time will be as this time- The Devil has come to Tsavo-
How; we don't know where they are?
I've got a reason far beyond confidence: my wife is having our firstborn in five months and I promised I'd be with her when the baby comes.
It hasn't been that simple so far.
What?
A man-eater attacks and you're such a buffoon you almost forget to mention it?
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
-I would never make excuses- but a fire broke out- the light was bad- he kept moving-
Excellent. Could I see the bridge site? 
...one shot...
But you said they were always old.
Let me save time-  you are the engineer;  you are in charge;  you're sorry I'm here. Right so far?  Good- because  I am not an engineer,  I don't want to be in charge, and  I'm sorrier than you are that I'm here- I hate Tsavo. So I will help you by killing the lions and leaving, and you will help me by doing what I tell you so I can leave. See any problems?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Good luck.
Understood- you realize now you could never have done it without me.
It's all wonderfully under control, Samuel- you've done a splendid job.
I am also liaison between these two.
We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night.
Three years I've worked for the railroad. Now I don't know why. It seemed a good idea once.
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
Oh, yes, I got in a little late this morning, Janosz.
Okay, just thought I'd check.  Good night, Dana.  Sleep well.  Don't let the bedbugs bite you.
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while I believe we could learn to love each other.  Think about it.
Hundreds of people.  Believe me, I didn't imagine this.
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Janine Melnitz, are you kidding?  Do I have a vase?  I brought some of your clothes.  Wear something intriguing.  I brought along some interesting possibilities.
For one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
That's a terrible thing to say.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I know.
Yes, the scourge --
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
Sustained.  Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
Why can't you just have them released? You're a doctor.
So, Dr. Venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
What now, Brainiac?
I think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
You know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  Given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
Who was that?
Nothing.  Not a trace.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Who?  Who?  Who?
This is what you do with your spare time?
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
Did you find anything at Dana's?
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
My Fault!
Now that's one ugly dude.
Huh?  What?
Nice going, Ray!  What were you trying to do -- drown me?
Eight o'clock?
... I thought it was the drug store.
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
Oh, sure.  I'm getting used to this.
Is that your professional opinion?
I told you, I ...
If it's any comfort to you, I don't think you're crazy.
I'll scream.
Goodbye.
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Fine.  This University will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
But why?  The students love us!
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
You have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
It's a great game!  You should play sometime.  I bet you'd be good.  You seem very athletic.  Do you have any hobbies?
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
No, you may not.
And what is the magic word, Mr. Venkman?
Two wavy lines?
What on earth gave you that idea?
You're a regular Sherlock Holmes.  Now what do you want?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Where's the Keymaster?
What do you mean by "seen?"
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
You'll never regret this, Ray.
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
And the seas would boil ...
Those are priceless sculptures.
Tribuus... tomorrow.
You're coming back?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Now that we're done with that infatuation forever.
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Tribuus, what happened in the arena? Was Narcissus killed?
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
I'm not fit for the job and as a matter of fact I'm not taking the job.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
So I understand.
They fear me.
What the hell do you think it was about?  There's nothing an unproved heir to the throne likes less than glaring competence in others.
Everyone knew you would have been outspoken against this deal.
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
Right, right... But they'll have to bring in a lawyer.  I don't want to get sued over this.
No.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Wait a minute.
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
With a family?
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Elaine --
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Come in.
What?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
What did she say?
I don't know.
We just can.
You really will?
Tomorrow?
Why wouldn't it?
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Oh.  Well -- I'm not sure -- but you might try the First Presbyterian. That's on Allan Street.
You a student?
BENJAMIN?
I'm in the bathroom.
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Did you get a room?
Give me an hour.
It's in the main ballroom.
A single room or a double room?
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
Is it a girl?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
No.
What's wrong?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
No.
Yes?
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
What are you so scared of?
Then why do you keep running away?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
I want to say something first.
Oh my God.
Benjamin?
May I have a drink?
Why don't you get it.
That's fine.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
To tell you?
Yes.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Oh -- yes. Wood?
Either one will be fine.
Is this -- what?
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
That you're afraid --
Well?
You're not interested in art?
Then why do you want to talk about it?
What novel did you read.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There!
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
Right.
Man, is this interesting.
I don't.
No.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
How do you think.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
Oh my God.
Then let's hear them.
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Yes.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
Don't start acting hurt.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
May I stay then?
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
You got me.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.
I will.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
I am not threatening you.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
Dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
No.
No --
I could take care of her.
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
I've quit.
I have an idea working in my head... 
Of course.
We'll dance.
Chasing what?
Going?
Yes -- oh!
What do you want here?
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
And then --?
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
And -- and --
Am I quite strange to you?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
And what do you do -- now?
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Shall I see you again?
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
On the train?
Yes -- I will be on the train.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
What?
You've lost everything?
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I take five hundred.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I must have made a mistake.
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
The Grand Hotel.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably. 
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
You dance splendidly.
Please -- please!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
No -- only occasional jobs. 
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Can't you understand me?
I must go to England -- at once.
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Can you pay some attention to me?
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
You're discharged.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
No. No word.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
Hi, Bobo.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
How'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
You're calling the shots.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
Roy? He's always crying.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
So here we are!
Want a look?
You ruined me! You destroyed me!
Can't move.
The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us, New York one hour behind. There isn't one hour of the day when both are open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow working here -- Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Kaggs. Home office.
Makes no difference to me if they're only on commission. If they don't make good money, they're not giving us good representation, and we can't afford to have them around. Ever supervise salesmen?
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
I guess I owe you my life.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down.  It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
You want a drink?
Uh-huh.
Never.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
That's right.
I don't see why not.
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
This time...
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Oh, don't be stupid.
Big spender.
You were right, I had to get out of that hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
The long end. Big con.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
) The track? Did you run into Lilly?
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
And hello to you, too.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
Gun?
I grant you, it's a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.
That's that, then.
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
As which point she drops to her knees in pain...
What do you want me to do, put out an A.P.B. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
We're sorry to startle you, Miss Tate.
I'll be damned.
Mind if we sit down?
What the fuck are you talking about?
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Hey, you alright?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
The serial killer?
Look, they're staring right at us.
I have to pee.
I thought you were allergic to latex.
You think they'll let him in dressed like that?
Shit, Linda!
Have enough fun for the both of us.
Whatever happened to women in back?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
Jamie?  But I thought she was --
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was you.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
No!!!
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
Go home!
Go home.
So long, Colonel.
How short the skirts are.
Leave me alone!  After eight years of horrendously close association, the time has come to part!  I crave solitude and time for reflection-- and then a reunion in privacy with my own flesh and blood.  You and I may not meet again for months!
Excuse me.
How do you know that?
Go to the funeral?
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
You did?
The one direct, decisive, intelligent act of your life!
If I hadn't done it.  If I'd said to myself, "Screw it.  I'm going to let all those people down there live."
They were enemies.  We were at war.
How are you, honeybunch?
Eight years you guys were together-- through thick and thin.
Are we really going to find out where the elephants go to die?
What?
For Africa.
Gee whiz--
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Hello.
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
College!
It's rather a disappointment these days.  It isn't there any more.
You're supposed to get hurt!
They're not engaged.
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
A hundred dollars!
Pick up that cartridge and slip it back into the chamber--where it belongs.
Like hugging a lamp post.
Disease?
You used to like it stark!
I have some change!
Cook, by God!  Cook!  You're the nigger now.
Unless she has nerve.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
Rifle?
Last I heard, his mother was going alone.
Like what?
He's a child!
With an iron penis three feet long. Load it, boy.
If that's the case--what's to prevent my killing myself?
I'm going to call the police.
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
She's fine.  Please--
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
Wasn't that sweet of me?
We have, have we?
Yes.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
Now who's being cruel?
Hands and knees, you say?
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I'm to be left behind--in primordial ooze?
No quarter asked.  No quarter given.
I've poisoned you. HAROLD  Lucretia Borgia?  Something I drank or touched?  You refused a cigar.  That's it! Potassium cyanide in the humidor! Treacherous lover of peace!
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
I--I really must congratulate you. Something is happening in there.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
But the new hero will be a man of science and of peace--like me. He'll disarm you, of course.  No more guns, no more guns.
We never quit fighting until we're dead.
I'm going to shoot you now.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
I don't care what she wears.
I know.
You're married!  You've already got a husband!
You're the only woman he ever took out.
I didn't know that.
Don't know.
Mom?
That man is your father.
Everything stays as it is!
A monument to a man who thought that what the world needed most was more rhinoceros meat.
Don't worry about it.
Doing what?
That's something I suppose.
I'm glad.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
Something happens to my confidence.
Coming.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
I feel as though I had been made a perfect chump of.
It's true.
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
What?
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
That's the XKE.
Meaning?
Do it!
Start with the smallest weights. Every week add a pound or two.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
We're going to have jackets, aren't we?
No. I don't think so.
What are you doing?
Pull out your cock.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Man, how many girls do you need?
What do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, Mary.
What's that shade of blue called?
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Joanne?
Where is she?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
Huh?
At least I'm a growing person.
Say what?
Is that the way it was with you?
No.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
It's an anagram. It comes from the Canons of Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
But what?
Yeah.  She was the one called Joanne. How'd you find that out?
I don't blame you, Niki. Really I don't. It's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, TV. It's destroying everything. Buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. Kids think it's normal. They think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
...What do you have to offer?
Mr. Van Dorn?
What's it called?
Yeah, sure.
I'm sorry about that. Have you found anything out? You've got to tell me.
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What plan?
Where is she? Where is the girl?
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
What you got in mind?
Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
That's all right.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
In other words, you want to get laid?
You have to understand. He can be mean, self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. He's capable of doing anything.
To his own daughter?
Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Took it?
Lady, let me get this straight.
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
We planted it.
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Because if you are...
She supplies the whole southwest with chicken feed.
Exactly! Now, ask me what I see.
What do you see?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
But this is my car.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
You look as if you could.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
What is it?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
I think he's following us.
I'm sure picking up on vices.
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Of course.
With God?
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Where's that?
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
But they have.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
I took them out.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
And why is that?
Yes. It does.
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
No.
Yes.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
Thank you, Uncle.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
You think so, sir?
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Ah! There you are, madam. Were not you the lady who drove my car off yesterday?
Were you also the one who painted the statues?
No more delays, Kirsty. No more teasing. Time to play.
Yes. You're a girl who remembers her promises.
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
It's a beautiful dress...
She certainly has.
What?
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
I've got to finish it.
I'm scared.
Well... G'bye.
You're in the Malahide Institute. It's a psychiatric hospital. But, hey, don't feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. Remember? You and your boyfriend...?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
I need to touch it to "see"...
Skip to the end, willya?  How do I kill it -- ?
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
I thought you liked being on TV.
Don't look! Turn around.
Icthyo Sapiens, April 14, 1865.
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
I don't want him.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
She's dead.
But not everyone was so lucky.  Two agents died today. Clay probably won't survive the night. You're reckless.
What took you so long?
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.
We miss you at the Bureau. Abe's crazier every day. And Father's still mad at me --  Come back, Liz. Come back. I --
Goodnight, then.
I like that...
He's just pushy.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
It's freezing, isn't it?
This isn't for real.
Let me alone, will you?
Suppose he HAD slipped us. What significance has that?
I have to speak to my father.
I don't remember.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
No.
This isn't happening.
No.
Bastard.
There is going to BE a wedding?
Well can I come in or not?
Help me.
What kind of doors?
Who did?
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
It gave me a little chance, and I took it. They won't get me back. I'm going to live, and you're going to help me. Yes?
I said no.
Where's Daddy?
No, damn you --
Not exactly modern.
Is it deep?
You're NOT going to faint.
I'll be scarred for life.
Larry....
Sure.
What's wrong?
Just soda.
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
What's going on?
Oh Christ.
Where are you?
Well come over, will you? See the place?
I love you, honey.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.
It's like she's waiting for something.
Need any help?
It's late.
Why don't you stay at Larry's house? There's plenty of room.
There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
If I make it through the day.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Just trying to get my apartment in order.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Say it.
Nice, Barry.
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet.  Yet.  What does "yet" mean, anyway?  "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean?  It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you?  That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
What band?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
None.  Christ!
Fuck off, Barry.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
What do you mean, four more?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc.  The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover.  You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
You look upset.
Maybe I should talk to him.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
What were the others?
What?
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
Fine.  One.
Well.  Sex, I guess.  Is sex with him better?
I'll look for 'em.  How you doing?
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
Pigsty.
Me?
Mmnn.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Harder.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
You did that deliberately.  You knew all along I'd like them.  It was a trick.
WHAT?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
What are you going to talk to me about?
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
You haven't even seen it!
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
That way.  You?
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Oh, come on!  Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
Eno import.  Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats.  Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here?  Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Naw.  Those are for us.
You're very macabre.
Happy birthday.
I don't follow you.
Would you remember his name?
Taupin, Richard Marshall.  Born March 16, 1945 in Church Hill, Maryland.  Received first driver permit 1967 in Philadelphia.
Church Hill, that's pretty close, isn't it?
Do you play?
I think you do.  Better yet, I don't think anything was stolen because nothing was there in the first place. And I think Mr. Smith, whoever he is, now knows that.
Jesus Christ.
Not your concern.
What about me?
What's all that?
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
I'm not even sure why.
That would be difficult to explain.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
Of bodies.
What about that family in '31?
Will I see you again?
No!
You have lived forever.
It will be horrible.  The future.  I may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. I can promise you nothing.  Nothing but a moment.  Maybe two.  But a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
I've got a morgue filling up with bodies.  That's my right.
What's all of this got to do with me?
I don't believe him.
Your name is Conor?
Aye.
Pheasant.
Yes.  Always.
I don't understand.
Harder!  You swing like an impotent cow!
You have not been fully trained. But you will learn.  And you will be good, I can feel that.  You have apt- itude.  This is why our friend is so concerned.
But why be so concerned about me?
You must be.  You have responsibilities. You must learn the rules.  You can never attract attention to yourself, never show the side that will draw others to you.  You will always know when you are in the presence of another.  Beware. But more importantly Conor MacLeod, will be your battle against time.  In the coming years you will see kingdoms rise then rot like wheat.  People will become a transitory, pathetic lot.  The only constant you will know will be the others and the tradition their greed and quest represent.  But life without morality, without the ability to truly taste the sweetness of wine and love, is no life at all.  That is how the others exist.  Nothing more than walking corpses living only to slaughter each other in an insane quest to be the last.  Keep your soul sewed to the earth.  Do not become one of them.
Of course.
But I did live.
Please not be touching me, Conor.
Romirez understood.  Not you.
I am a Major, Private.  You would do well remembering that when addressing me.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
You are really going to force this, aren't you?
Figure she's with him?
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
You've been here from the start.
Friend of yours?
Perhaps Miss Cartwright would like to play.
Leave her alone.
Are you here?
This your present address?
But I had heard his wounds were mortal.
His only kid.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes.  Up a dime.
Who is it?
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
Yes, wasn't it?
Hildy!

But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
How's business, Bruce?
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
What do you want?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
You can break it, can't you?
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Sweeney.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Say, could I meet him?
Then what does he want with you?
What tricks would I pull?
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Hildy!
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
Is he coming back here?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
No, you don't! Walter!
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Who do you want?
He's on my phone. He just called me.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Three bullets! Any good?
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
I'll call.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!
How's everything, Gus?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
Just one second --
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Pure politics!
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Now, Hildy --
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
Five hundred dollars.
Search me! When I come to I was running down Thirty-fifth Street.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Here!
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
Kings and sixes.
Hiding him where?
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
What good'll it do?
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
How much do you make a week?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
No, I don't think so.
For heaven's sake, why not?
What's that?
Never let a rat creep up on you.
That was a googly!
This is going too far, young man.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I don't mind.
You couldn't.
Pauline.
...and four and five...
But Dad, It's the News.
You said that last year, Dad.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Root it out Clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
What's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
You know it? It must be an old one.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
I agree.
Ma, Tiny's in.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
He walks, duh.
But if you did.
Yeah, no shit.
Fuck yeah, she is. I'd join a cult to get some of that... and the best part is she didn't try to kill the President or nothing, so that baggage ain't hanging around.
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Yeah.
Really fucking awesome.
Well, technically I did what ya said.
Hey, I asked you if you wanted some chicken.
Just grin and bear it.
Why are we stopping?
How much is a person supposed to stand?
What I need are some answers. 
Well, I'll try but I don't know nothing 'bout nobody. I'm a guy who likes to mind his own business, if ya get what I'm saying.
Come on, get with the facts.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Fuck your grandmother.
You sure you don't need any help in there?
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Why?
Yeah?
Thank you.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
God, I hate falling asleep in the afternoon. Now I'll be up all night...  ...ugh, my back is killing me.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Jesus Christ.
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
This is way too fucked up for words.
Thank you.
What should I do?
Fit the profile?
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Well, let's go see if the nut that runs this place can help us.
I hope you're right, but my guts are telling me different.
Hulk was dumb as shit.
Don't worry, we'll find her.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
French?
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
So soft. So smooth.  I'm sorry. It's just...
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
My little French.
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
No!
You were wonderful!
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad.
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
You've got to respect that.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
Oh, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
Yeah  But I have some peculiarities also.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
That's very funny.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Really?
You remember that from my book? I'm touched!  What's wrong?
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Yes.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
Extra dessert?
Free to come and go as you please. There's some "mad money" in the night table drawer.
You did create me in your image, Nathan. Before you I was a simple, happy, complete being, in harmony with the world around me. After you I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, anal, totally out of touch with my surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I became you. Lila has reintroduced me to myself. And, incidentally, what I'm about to do, kill you, is something that would never have occurred to me to do as a creature of the Earth. Before when I killed, it was for food or in self-defense. Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge is an abstract concept, Nathan. And I learned abstract thinking from you.
Wait!
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
I'll make it up to you.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Character.
Thanks for the drink.
You think I can lose?
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
Where do I sign?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Here, I got it.
What's the matter? What happened?
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
No. Hell, no! You Eddie Felson?
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
How much we got?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
You don't need a drink.
Hello, Eddie's girl...  I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I want you to come back on the road with me.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  What for? To take another beating?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Hey, you're Eddie Felson, aren't you?
Who's he?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Try me.
You sure you don't want to quit, friend?
Okay, friend. You're on.
You quittin', friend?
Yours.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
It's the lights. And the scotch.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Eggs. How do you like them?
What happened?
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
Two.  Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
No, I want to walk.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
He went off someplace.
California. Oakland.
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Hundred dollars?
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Very good shot.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Do you remember where you lived?
Who is this?
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
What's inside?
Who?
Emma...
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
So, what do you do?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
... and Rigel.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.
We'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
Hello, this is Ms. Magnuson speaking.
You're looking for life?
You have to leave the White House.
Just my luck, no ice.
All he could think about was getting to you. There's still love there I think.
We're losing them.
What the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
There's good news and bad news.
You're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
What happened?
Remember I told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
That signal. It's a countdown.
Dad, don't start.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
You still got the Olds?
College nickname.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
How're we doing?
But what, General?
I'm a dancer.
No. Exotic.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
It's all fuzzy.
Above American soil?
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Yes.
Can they be killed?
Why did you people come here?
Here... now.
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
May we go home now, please?
Your treat.
Dad?
Venice, Italy!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
That's usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
What's that?
It is you Junior!
And the head.  You hit me, Dad!
Found it.
This is intolerable!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
What about Marcus?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
Actually, I was a wonderful father.
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad?
You call this archaeology?
That was seven hundred years ago.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
I don't need camels.
Where's my father?
You think so?
The Prime Minister doesn't seem that naive.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
The plane crash and your journey here sound -- most incredible.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
We'd appreciate it if the Maharajah would let us stay tonight. We'll be on out way in the morning.
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
No.
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
No. They are here -- somewhere. A century ago when the British raided this temple and butchered my people, a loyal priest hid the last two stones down here in the catacombs.
What evil?
You will find them when you find sivlalinga.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
The old man saw it in a dream.
Don't worry, I'm coming in! What is it?
Don't let it curl around you!
What?!
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
Is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, Dr. Jones?
He's afraid of something.
A fulcrum release lever!
Indy? Did you talk to them?
Yes.
Well, you didn't get your prince, and there goes your diamond.
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
I just went there for a job.
Loading a gun.
You're not crazy.
You're gonna explain.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
What'd he look like?
I wouldn't say that.
You gotta help.
Thanks.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Door's locked.
A lab and equipment.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
I don't wanna be you. I wanna go home.
Who is it?
Who?...  Wait a minute! I'm no agent, secret or otherwise. And..I'm alone.
We get on a plane.
...and a license to kill...
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
Eat it.
This must be business, there's nothing else here.
What's happening?
What do I do?
Wait.
...Joe.
Where are you going?
To the hotel. To register.
Rene...
Pan the group, will you. If you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
Just don't show fear.
Joe, be careful!
She's the toughest to read.
And on my time.
Bingo.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Follow her.
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Where are you going?
What do I do?
Door to the right. Get up and run.
What?
Probably.
I don't trust her.
I can't handle that thing.
Pretty advanced, isn't it?
Do something.
She is beautiful.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault...I was wrong.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE What abilities...?
I'm...scared.
What kind of a deal?
They have stolen state property.
I knew he was following us. He diverted attention, exposed Ryuji's trap..
They took the tapes.
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
Yes?
He's not an ordinary man.
Enough ROmance.
Al Viola.
How do I look?
Why would we want to hurt you?
Who?
That Rene...lovely girl...a killer!
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?
Just give me the keys.
Yes...What is it?
Oh...and who is it!?
I'll be right there.
Do what?
Wait. What's your name?
And how'm I doing?
...Naw. Made that up.
They left. I had to go with them.
Were you working for him last night?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
Oh sure.
And Dieter.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Hong Kong.
You've  been there?
You can say that again. What do we do?
Who are you? Who do you work for?
Now what?
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
Why'd you invite me here?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
It is?
Yes.
Screw the PEM...What about Al...
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
What was that about?
Get me Wigand.
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'll see if I can find him. Hold on...  Yeah, Don's looking for you...
Do you want more rice?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Debbie...
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Soy sauce...
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
My name's Lowell Bergman... I'm --
Did you say Berman?
No, Bergman... B.E.R.G.M.A.N.... I'm a producer with "60 Minutes"...
What are you and Mike going to do?
From my perspective, what's been going on and what I've been doing is ridiculous. It's half-measures.
Yeah...
Is it too late?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
...you filed a lawsuit against tobacco on behalf of the State of Mississippi, did you not?
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
Yeah, I'm here.
...and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick...
So, is everything okay?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
But in all that time, Mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? Lost his heart? Walked out on us? Not one fucking time! You want to know why?
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
...but that's as far as I go...
Far as you go where?
Did work.
Jump in, quick, c'mon...
What do...
And, I'm unemployed. So I have to protect my medical coverage.  ...so I left them a message this morning. Their expanded confidentiality agreement? I will sign it.
Seven dwarfs?
You charge by the hour?
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
Are you talking to me or did somebody else just walk in here?! I never abandoned a source!
Excuse me. Yeah...
Jeff, call the FBI right away...
I know. I'm going to go there tonight...
"Part of the reason I'm here is I felt that their representation clearly, at least within..."
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
No? No, what?
I told the truth!
Yes. Did you lie about being on the American Judo Team in the Olympics?
That's bullshit, Jeff!
What about now?
Just give me an example...
Hold on a minute, Lowell...  ...somebody... may be following me. I don't know. They came on the property...
I don't want to be paranoid... I mean, maybe it's a game. Some kind of mind game.
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Well, I wouldn't say --
You did good, Massey!
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
No!
Who's the pigeon?
Grounds?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Got any symptoms?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Marylin! What have I done?
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
Gotcha.
He's passionate.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
I don't believe you have "things."
No buts. Now. Out.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
You were going to have this thug...?
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Pre-Castro.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Hello, Rex.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
So. Now what?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
So what?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
So, Miles. If you have a proposal, let's hear it.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Did Marylin end up with money?
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
I don't know. I can assume...
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
Nothing.
Video.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
We can't do the impossible, Mr. Andrews.
Oh—Mary—
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
Yes, I know—but—
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
Why don't you put me in chains?
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Stunt?
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
I don't know.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
What a hell cat. No controlling these modern girls.  They're terrible!
We've done that already.
Yessir.  There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them?
Tonsil? Me? No! Me burn a tonsil?  "My tonsils won't burn— As life's corners I . . .
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
I found it on the seat.
Take my advice—grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Hey—you're little, aren't you?
Yeah?
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Next week "East Lynne."
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
Here. Eat your head off.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
You think it's simple, huh?
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement—  That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Eat a carrot.
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
That's swell!
But can't you wait until morning—
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho?  It's tough enough as it is.
What's 'at?
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants.  Yeah?  Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
Wait a minute, Gordon—I—
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars—and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
If it's on the level.
Well, I got it, Joe.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
Yeah.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
You send telegrams here?
Yeah.
There's a seat over there for you.
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time. 
Why?
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
Yeah—the "big boy"—the Boss of the outfit.
When you're in a war, boss, you use every weapon you got.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
What was his voice like?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
There were no phone records.
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Chief, sometimes I don't know whether you're kidding or not.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
Yeah, I guess you do.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in jail.  I got no reason to lie to you.  I ain't no nigger.
Hold your horses.  What kinda source?
He'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's talking.
With a full-blown conspiracy to cover it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, Bill?
Not in a routine autopsy, but if we looked at the spinal fluid, there might be a high level of iodine, but it's difficult to know.  Whatcha thinkin', Jim?
You still questioning any Cubans?
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.
Did we involve you, Dave, or did Clay Shaw?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
But the boys told us they didn't get any.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
And Shaw?
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
No, because there were others.  There were admirals.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
I'm sorry.
We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you.  Are you acquainted with a David Logan?
No.  Never heard of him.
A Willie O'Keefe?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
David Ferrie.
Let me show you his picture. 
Please answer the question.
...and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma, Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans...
That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck."
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
I cannot believe this.  It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family!  All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Oh no!... How bad?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
The Zapruder film is the proof they didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get our hands on it.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Maybe you didn't hear what I said. I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff, I warn you that...
Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
Well, thanks for coming.
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Well, believe what you want, boss, but we got to be more careful.  All these new volunteers, any one of them could be...
Sure sounds like he's winning.
I don't think so, Al.  You remember the Hemingway story, "The Old Man and the Sea"?  The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the boat to get it back in.  But by the time he reached shore, the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton.
Germany.
If you must know, virtually nothing.
That's all you've had all this time?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
You were there for me.
I found out.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
You don't want much, do you?
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
I thought you might want a drink?
Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
You're not tired of it?
What have they told you?
How many trips did you make?
He's got that kinda money?
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
It's different with men.
Catching a movie.
Does it happen to all men?
Who was your girl before Annette?
How old's Annette?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Got another gun and a stun gun...
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
Set him up.
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
That's Ordell's.
I didn't say you did.
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Not really.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
She told you that?
Well, it's true, isn't it? After this is buttoned up we could meet someplace else. What do you think?
That would be one point of view.
I'm glad you realize that. Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.  Put this in your shopping bag. It's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda's. Comprende?
I have no idea.
I thought you were watching him.
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
What about me?
Better get me another Sam's.  Join me in a Jaeger shot?
How long you been with Ordell?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
You think I'm kidding?
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
I just came here to talk.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
A woman.
But you don't?
That's the idea.
Can you cover that?
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Drink?
How do you know she did that?
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Who's paging you?
That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Where at?
What for?
Who's arm is that?
Wanna fuck?
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
We're leaving now!
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Yeah, down the end.
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
This one.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
This one's for the ignition...  ...but you gotta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door.
The moon -- I dunno
Who was that?
Yep.
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
You shot her twice?
Maybe forty, maybe not that much.
Came outta where?
Okay, so it was Jackie Brown.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
What?
They don't have your winning personality.
I can see that. Why?
What does she do for you?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
Uh-huh.
She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent. She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it.
In a way, yes.
She starts givin' me some bullshit about it ain't there. It's somewhere else and we can go get it.  I'm shootin' you in the head right then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot her in the kneecap, find out where my godamn money is. I go walkin' in there and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you're the first man shot, understand what I'm sayin'?
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
No problem.
He's around.
Then what are you doing here?
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
I'm okay.
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You're hurting me!
Stop!!!!
Daddy. Let go.
I could have told you that.
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
It was the window.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
What can I tell you?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about? You can barely stand.
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
Have you considered a doctor? A psy- chiatrist?
Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
No. Have you seen my glasses?
Eli. Why can't you remember their names?
A good lay.
What?
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Is that the one who died?
Wait. Don't.
Jake!
I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
We're at Della's.
Don't gimme that.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
He did? When?
Let go!
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
You've lived with me for two years.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
Goddamn it. Why do you say that?
Then don't bug me.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Sit down!
This isn't happening.
The Ladder?
So why tell me now?
You come here often?
I can't move.
I no from around here.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
This is not a dream! This is my life.
Speaking.
Jesus Christ. How've you been? What's happening in your life?
I just need to talk.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  Just watch 'em.
What's goin' on Paul?
You in trouble?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
Don't do anything.  Paul, I know what you're talking about.
I've seen them too ... the demons!
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
Duck fuckers?
We can't lead him into the other hull!
Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue ship on radar.
Sergeant? We thought you were...
What?!
Better let me.
Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
I'm with you kid.
Where is he?
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, God!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Give me a break! What happened?
Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.
What if you miss?
I thought you meant...
You?
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .
Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab.
What do we do?!!
Kay-em 14.
Sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
What?
Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels. See what kind of payday we're looking at.
Nanotechnology.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
What have you done?
Yes!
Can we get through these?
Cut my hand. Hit by a vampire.
Cash? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise?
All right, Commissioner. But when we're on my ship, I am Master, Mate and Pilot. And I want him...  ...along for ballast.
Who's driving the boat?
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
I never saw one that big.
C'mon. Middle appendix --
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
He's comin' up -- !
Where is he?
It's three feet deep, Martin
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
Why?
Maybe we can save August...
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
No, we just checked the beach...
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
Florida license plate.
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
Think the tide's with us?
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
...and Bill Mayhew almost caught him in his net...?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
What have you got there, Lenny?
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
Watch it! Compressed air -- you screw around with one of those and Boom! Careful, huh?
That's pilot whale, isn't it?
Over there!
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Cool.
I don't know...
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Jesus, Bleek.
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Wait, let me take that.
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Did you hear it's yours?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
No.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Am I supposed to feel happy now?
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
What do you play?
I rock a Harmony.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Come on in. You wanna Ginseng Cooler?
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cold feet.
Is Vanessa here?
But you're old!
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Nothing...
Is the baby okay?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Excuse me?
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
I sort of already have.
So what's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle? Minus or plus?
Dude, I'm pregnant.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
You don't say.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
A Pilates machine?
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Looks like it, yeah.
Adele for god sake please lis...
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Are you takin' the pictures?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Where you from Walter?
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
It's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
All set?
Fuck!
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie... stop it.
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand?
Could be.
With how many people?
You're clean.
Are you hungry?
You think he's got any herb?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
The cartoon?
Yeah.
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I'm gonna fuck her tonight. I swear to God I'm gonna fuck her.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
Why I give pennies?
So.
Good luck?
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
How much you gonna take?
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
Casper! Was up kid?
Yeah.
Right now?
Yeah. After I saw you last week.
Why is that?
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
What?
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah, I guess so.
No.
Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
You still mad at him?
You are being ripped open.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Do you know where he went?
Yep.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
Yep.
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
How can you hang out with Casper? He's such a jerk.
But then I won't need your money.
Slow.
What's that supposed to mean?
What?
Yes you are.
The message!  I figured out--
Local?
What do you think?
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Sorry.
Now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
I couldn't tell you that.  It would ruin the game.
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
Yes?
Please... wait.
It's me you want.  Not her.
Don't you see?  I had to make it right. I ignored my mother's crossing.  I sat with them all.  I held their hands.  I stroked their hair.  I was with them to the end.  I took away the blood.  I washed them.  Their crossing was peaceful.
Naw, it's all fixed.  I also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
What scars?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Why did he?
Not really.  It's pretty boring.
That's only because you don't know where to go.  You like hiking?  Fishing?  Sailing?  What do you like?
Mrs. Lutz.  She also told me that Mr. Lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great Grandmasters in the spirit world.
You ready?
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
There's no blood.  Where's the fuckin' blood?
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
I'm busy right now.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
Each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
He's right, Kathy.
We're going to work on the message.
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
Are we going to go through this again?
Answer the question.
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
Mate in five.
She went into town with Mrs. Lutz.  Did they get him?
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.
Is this your first time here?
That's a very personal question.
Well, I think I've had enough.
Oh, but it is.  He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  That's a game.  It has rules and objectives.
How can you look at it so clinically?
Do you?
You're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
I know you didn't
Doesn't that scare you?
It was.
This frightens me -- because I'm starting to feel things I haven't felt in a long time.
I thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
Would you settle for pepperoni?
What?
Hi.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
It could be anything.
You're getting sloppy, Yurilivich. You're nervous?
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
I don't know how.
In the Arctic ice.
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
The new Queen lives.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
You will tell me her name and we will go together.
She must make a glaive.
Slayers!
It is today?
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
We must try to get horses.
Make for the wall. I'll catch up.
I am Ergo the Magnificent ...  ... short in stature ...  ... tall in power ...  ... narrow of purpose ...  ... wide of vision.
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
He didn't join them. They joined him.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
It is important to assure the succession.
I knew.
Can you see?
Yes.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
I was beautiful then.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
But you would not stay with me.
We had no children.
You had left me! I kept silent out of rage.
How can you say it?
What, for example?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
You were scared, weren't you?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
Not taken.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
Yeah, I know! But for the moment you're not yet a woman. So, be patient... I need time... And you too. You have to grow up.
...Don't you drink?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
You... You knock the code, when you come back, OK?
...Yes.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Yeah, true.  But what does your father exactly do for living?
...Composer.
Have you ever been in Messina, son?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Nothing's going to happen.
What?
Listen to me very carefully, because I don't want you to misunderstand me... The walk is over Uncle Maurice.  Done. Finished.  You've made it to California, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
Routine, I assure you.  I just wanted to gage my health.  Am I healthy?
You do?
Okay.
I don't know -- maybe twenty miles... Of course I'm not recommending that... if someone like you had to I mean... that's how far they'd probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
Anything?
Then why?
I don't know.
I think it's a different place for each person.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Red flag, man.
Your parents would want you to be in bed.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Okay nine.  Big Billy's team was losing and he was on base.  That's when Isaac came up.  He could barely hold the bat... Big Billy winked at Isaac... The ball was pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard. It soared up and out over the stadium.  Everyone cheered.  Isaac hit a home run and won the game. After the game, Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play.  Big Billy smiled and said, I wasn't always Big Billy, I was Little Billy first... Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  The end.
Three thousand miles?... How many times does twenty go into three thousand?
Umm, no.  It's just that --
Lizy, Eliza... Elizabeth Bennett...  Pride and Prejudice.
Tom Joad?
What do you mean?
What's your shoe size?
Coffee?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Don't run away.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
How long have I been here?
Sera...
Me neither.
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
What was that all about?
Can we just forget it?
About ready for another drink?
Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Where are you staying?
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
But it's a top three school --
What alibi?
I'll take that as a no.
And when you came downstairs, what happened?
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
You're hitting on me?
You're a beautiful girl, Elle.
Was she carrying a weapon?
What?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
After you went to all that trouble?
Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
What's the point?  Look at me.
I'm so happy for you!
Great. Donovan actually said the words "Good work, Ms. Woods". He takes me seriously! Can you believe it?
Relation?
The idiot speaks.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
You almost had me fooled.
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Can someone please tell Rick that he is not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Power yoga?
Picking out my wedding dress!
Neat.
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?
Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think a sixty-year-old man can take?
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
As long as you realize I'm not just some man-toy you can show off like a trophy.
No -- it's just -- not me.
You guys -- I can't. We're in the middle of a trial.
I wish we could stay longer, but I have a game.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Class schedule, map, book list.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
So you're breaking up with me because you're afraid your family won't like me?  Everybody likes me!
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt, all of a sudden I'm white trash? I grew up in Bel Air, Warner! Across the street from Aaron Spelling! I think most people would agree that's way better than a Vanderbilt --
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Well, yeah, but --
Elle?
You passed Spanish because you gave Professor Montoya a hand-job after the final.
You go?  Not watch fun?
Fire moat... why do that?
You go to lady now?
But I'm hideous!
You're magnificent.
Damn you!
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
Might we watch, too?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You come stealee tleasoo?
Cathay?
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
What!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Aye.  That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells.  Oona... lure her out.  Play the part of a girl-child.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
Tricks, is it?  Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp!  I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
Water doesn't burn...
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Jack!  The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower.  No sign of... Jack?  Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
It doesn't matter.
Can you save her?
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Will you explain what's going on?
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
How're these?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
But you did... you did!
I may have said perhaps...
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
My father and the Baron.
He did run?
Tis the truth.
My lady mocks me.
In the dark... where I join him...
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
No!
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
You... you... you mortal you!
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What's she doing?
Up ahead!
You should stay.
I wanted him to marry her.
Why?
Does everything have to have a point?
Josh said...
I was wondering.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
A sink?
I assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Pardon me?
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Maybe...?
I didn't recognize you!
I'm sorry.
You don't have a choice.
Are you totally insane?!
What are you doing?!
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
It bugs me.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
Oh, so you're in the big shit now!  Child abuse.  People go to prison for what you just did to me.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I know.  Why?
How do you become something you're not?
I wish you had told me then.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
To hide a black eye.
I loved him too much.
You look better than ever.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What kind of house?
Stage four pancreatic cancer.  They haven't even pretended to offer treatment.  You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Left you this place.
God, you look like crap, George.
Lock the door behind you.
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
I can't leave the house?
But you hated four out of the five you did.
Which?
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
I dreamed about your house last night.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Do you need help?
I smiled at him.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
No.  Mostly me.
Are you going to kiss me?
Don't move!
I better get the kids home.
You got any weed?
He said he heard hammering.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Where are the kids?
I don't know what I'm doing.
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Queer.
I brought a few of my own.
Adam, that's not true!
Go tell your father we're eating.
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
You can try, but you won't get too far. Why you interested?
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you...
But you can't.
Do yourself a favor and find another place where they let you in the front door.
Yeah...
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Probably to Spanky's headquarters down at the pier.
Good, I'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky. Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess.
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
No, tell me what's so funny.
That's right, a loan officer.
Oooh...
Maybe we oughta find another place.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?
What gave you that idea?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
So you made a generous contribution.
It ain't here.
You want out of this place, don't you? Don't tell me you're starting to like it here.
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later?
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh?
On your behalf. What happened to we?
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
What about us? Don't forget to mention us.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
What the hell are you doing?
I ain't escaping! We're picking up the new super just like I told you.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
I said you're soft.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
'Course I was right. About what?
Shh! Is that so hard to believe?
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
I can't eat this.
I know you're not talking to me...
You ever done time before?
What is that?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Made just for you, Cookie.
Too hot, huh? Well, you tell that lazy jiggaboo the state of Mississippi ain't interested in his meteorological assessments.
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
He's crazy. Don't listen to him, Wilkins.
That's a real nice watch you got there, sir. Fancy old thing even plays a little tune.
Sure don't. Mind if I ask where you got it?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
What are you in for, Willie?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Where'd you get this?
Let her go.
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
Valerie's crying!
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
This is bad, Nicky.
You came through, Nicky.
Hey.
I know, your wickedness.
Boogerland!
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
This don't look good.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
School?
No.
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Don't do it.
A black guy?
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
How do you think we got here??!!
Is that the wind?  Not yet...  You must hear my birds sing.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Open your eyes once, idiot.  It's not every day that a Sandman son is born. I'm telling you, Francis -- that's him!
You should have been with us in Nursery, Daniel. I'm positive I recognized him --
Who invited you?
You? Why? You're already beautiful.
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
He was killed.
Isn't it right? Isn't that what you do? Kill.
Maybe... sure...
You know.
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why tell me?
I wish I could help you.
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I have.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems...
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
Will he find us and kill us? Yes... or one of the others.  You know there's only one place to go now...
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
I doubt it.
Don't ever let go.
What does it mean?
...But I still have the choice...?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
Things won't change... you know that! We can live here together, Logan... have a life as long as his... together!
Yes, cats, of course. What else could they be? Cats. Of course each one has his own name too.
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
No.
It's all right with me. Is he here?
But there may be a few around somewhere.
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
What's beyond this place -- do you know?
Did your Mother or Father ever mention another place?
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
You're not contagious are you?
Do you own a video camera?
No.
Maid? Relative?
You don't remember being awakened? It looks like you were aware of someone.
Yeah, I remember.
I can't see you tonight.
We should stop seeing each other.
How'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
In pornos?
So, should I call Andy?
Why are ya goin' so early?
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
Are you my man?
Alice...
Dick Laurent?
Arnie called this morning while you were sleepin'. They miss you pretty bad down at the garage. I told 'im you still had a "fever".
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Yeah.
You don't look so good.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Sheila?
His physical condition.
Where's Pete?
Did you ask him who he is?
That's not Fred Madison?
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
When he went to work, right.
I'll get a manual.  and study it.
We've met before, haven't we?
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Where's Alice?
Who's it from?
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
What night?
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
So?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
What happened? Somebody givin' you trouble?
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
I'm leavin' the Caddy, like I told you. Think you'll get a chance to give her a once over today?
Sure... Sure, Mr. Eddy. You gonna pick it up later, or tomorrow?
What?
At your house. Don't you remember?
We just killed a couple of people...
You want some company?
Whatiya mean?
It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
Good morning, Lovey.
Is it?
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south—
Have I?
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
They were in a quandary, and—
It's unbelievable.
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
I mean, your amazement. I could have understood it in any of your companions, but you - who have dreamed and written so much about better worlds. Or is it that you fail to recognize one of your own dreams when you see it?
Your brother seems quite fascinated by her.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
What do you want?
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Yes.
You've very kind Mr. Lovett.
Why, no.
Then it's done.
Yes. She has read your books and has a profound admiration for you, as have we all.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
Don't you ever want to see what's on the other side of the hill?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
What if he refuses?
Huh? I give it up. But this not knowing where you're going is exciting anyway.
My name's Sondra.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Yes, I know.
I'm thirty.
All of it. Father Perrault and his magnificent history. This place, hidden away from the rest of the world, with its glorious concepts, and now you come along and confuse me entirely.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I was just going to.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
What do you want him to do?
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
They don't?
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Mikey.  Hold it, Mikey-- I want you to talk to me.  Mikey.  I'm telling you.. don't make me... Mikey   Gimme the 140.
I wasn't scared...
What?  Who the hell are you?
Vayanse. You others, go on.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
You don't know the half of it.
Why?
Now what?
Then wouldn't we also know if he's here?
Gee.  You really think?
What's going on, Kay?
I don't want to rattle you, but Dee was here for the War of the Worlds.
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus Christ...
How does that help me?
Do his job.
in case I need it?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Right, right-- I like that stuff.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
When?
What the hell does that mean?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
What are you doing?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Nowhere.
Er. well, nowhere special.
Noon exactly.
Actually, yeah--
Which way?
He's gone, too.
Is it now?
Take it.
He'll turn around.
Oh, God...
Please, I want to go back...
Why?
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
John?  What is it?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
So uh, if you were a plastic surgeon before...
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
... Graveyard shift.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
You don't have to do this, Chief.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
Really?  You've never been inside?
Just a nickname.
Her pituitary dumped a week's worth into her system... What did you do to her?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Wally, listen to me...
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Are you kidding?  There's absolutely positively no way, on my best day, I could ever beat twelve seconds!
The more you want to believe something, the easier it is to be fooled.
I was looking for you...
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
Fake.  He gave it to me.  Now --  -- shoot me, Goddammit, before I lose my nerve!
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
I'm not a murderer.  I've never even met the man I'm supposed to kill.
So you won't help me?
John?
Oh, God, what did you do?
The guy from USA Today is here.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
None of your damn business.
It's the same prevision.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
So there is a way to fool the system?
I wanna kill my boss.
Uh-huh.  Okay.  You got some images I can work with?
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
The information we need is embedded in the grain of wood.  And since each piece is unique, the shape and grain is impossible to duplicate.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
He looks familiar.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
So you haven't seen his apartment?
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
You know I need to use you.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
Martel's and coke. One ice cube. In a snifter this time.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
It's on West Broadway.
Manhattan.
Oh no. What is it this time.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
Honey?
A draw. What makes you think they're well mannered?
I don't like you working with Wendy. Why are you working with Wendy?
Who's watching the baby?
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I said no touching.
Yeah.
Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Now, here's what worries me. He said he wants to meet up at a bar in Red Hook. You know where that is?
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
This one?
Bobby. You're a bull terrier and I got you herding sheep.
Ruiz knows about this?
What about Ricky? He'd jump at the opportunity.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
'Dis?' 'Dis?' You're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your Real World sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. You're nothing. You're wallpaper. You're not here to make fucking friends. Asking a motherfucker where he lives. And who the fuck told you 'Red Dragon'?.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
Yeah.
Aren't we waiting for Ricky?
We're with Ruiz.
What are you saying?
So, it's not a winning record.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
No. You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
We look good this year.
Your first start at DB, it's against Fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
We're not delivering shit. Ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
What? Did she say something?
It's ours.
Pretty nice.
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Great. On my fucking room.
Fine. I'll put it on my room. Okay?
What are you doing?
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
This shit's sketchy. Why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
Missing what? He didn't say shit.
Back in.
You can't go in there. They know you're with Ruiz.
You got that right.
Dude, get back out there. You gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  Hang on girls! Just get out there. I'll be right out. You know how I do.
What's up?
He said it's being arranged. He said Jimmy will know.
I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Put that shit out...
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
Let's check out the penguins.
Yeah. Let's look at the penguins.
Eighty five.
I'm sorry...
The line's over there.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
S'up.
Yes?
I operate out of the Chicago O'Hare hub. Can I help you with anything else?
The Welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. But you motherfuckers, he just laughs. All beat up in your babaloo suit like Fruitpie the Magician.
I'm half Irish.
A little Charlie, perhaps.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
You're from LA, right?
Yeah.
Don't worry. I get it.
Some fuckin guineas he sent me. It's midnight and the motherfucker's ordering an apertif.
What they call you?
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Solid, daddy.
Okay, baby. Now you outfitted. You ready to tackle the street?
That's the last stuff you'll ever get from me.
You ain't lying.
Putting all that poison in your hair.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Then what you telling me to study in them for?
You pitch, baby; I'll ketch.
I can't.
Tell Him that.
What?
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Sat down with a pretty girl and had an ice cream soda.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
I want to also, but until we are instructed by the Messenger to do so, we will just wait and pray.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Entirely.
Did you see the papers today?
Say what you're saying.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --
500.
Another one?
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
Let me die then.
Me?
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
So? The man got silver, china, rugs --
That's right.
I'm the man.
Yes sir.
Are you sure?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
They talked about me like
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.
[Reina Rosas.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[Who's the boss?]
[The ransom money. At the drop. He said Tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. He was crazy.]
[Drive.]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[Mr. Creasy. What do you want?]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[The girl's. Pinta's.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
Is it loaded?
You got a secondary search and you had a gun.
Yeah, right...
Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
How long you staying, Crease?
You did something on impulse?
A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. Willing to talk. I'm not good at that.
I came to visit you.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Then one day, he calls and says, 'I'm in love and I'm moving to Mexico.' I said what happened to the plan?
Yes or no?
If they like me.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
I'm a bargain.
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
It hurts.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I don't understand.
No.
The blocks.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
That's strange. Frank was a no-show. Not like him to miss a ride.
You've done much of this work before?
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Look. Maybe this isn't going to work. Maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Where are you?
Yes, mom?
She likes him.
I've just been so busy, Lisa.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
That's what friends do.
Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
What makes you say that?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
What for?
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
You told me.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
You come up here often?
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
You say something?
That's the one.
What time is it?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
So I'll die without a son.
You not ugly.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
Hey, Ang'...
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
All right, Ginnie, don't get so excited.
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
I just wanna thank you people again, because the situation was just becoming impossible.
Well, I'll tell you, Aunt Theresa...
Put in one of your fixes. Walt knows he's loused himself with the Church, but it's part of our plan to make him think he has the keys to the kingdom. Which he will think if you grease the skids for him.
What do I do with it Hawk? This is a little out of my line.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Never this close.
Stop him! Stop that man!
Home.
Pulse, slow, very little pressure.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
You – must – open – me – up – again?
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Wisconsin.
What?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Best equipped dentist in the whole goddam Army. Care to have a look, a man with your background?
Never mind. Forget it.
Never heard of him.
Sure you have, only as 'Spearchucker' Jones.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
There's no point appealing to Colonel Blake. They've got him bewitched.
We're a good team.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Must be fun. But the point we want to make about Henry...
Come on, Trapper. We got to forget golf for today.
Never mind the conversation. Do it, Dad.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
That's right. We work well together.
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Our minds?
You're an attractive man.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
It was really nice of you to take me along.
Yes, Reverend?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
He's coming to.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
But it's all over now, and I can't face it. Imagine if you found out you were one, you wouldn't like breaking the news to your wife. Well, I got the same problem multiplied.
Damn.
Never mind.
Are you all right?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh. Yeah.
Ted Sheldon.
Thirty dollars? Well, er, what are you after? I mean, what do you want? A journalistic career?
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
A third party?
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
There is no letter.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
Well, you're catching on.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Well, maybe you're right.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
Where's Connell?
Oh, let me go, will you!
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
And then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
It must be some kind of a gag.
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
How about family? Got any family?
What's your name?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people—
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
That's got nothing to do with it!
She isn't?
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
What do you mean, too bad?
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
This SWAT guy might be a good idea. He may be able to take a little pressure off you. I worry about you.
Who is it?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
I hate fucking Springfield.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
Am I gettin' the car?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
For now that's all.
Recruited you from where?
You'd never been out of New York?
You caught me on an "up" day.  How about you? How did you end up in San Francisco?
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Thanks for clearing that up.  I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett.
Where did you hear that?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
Tell me what you need.
What's the first commandment?
Why did he do it?
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
Have you evacuated anyone?
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
I ain't interested in your life story.
Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
Hey.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.  Jack Daniels?
Scott, You can't save everyone.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
What do you think?
It's because I wanted to keep you away from that world.
Stay up there, Girl...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
The financial kind. I figure I'm going to be working extra hours. All sorts of overtime... training sessions... Not to mention the extra stress...
I'll provide you with transportation.
The chief says to tell you how sorry he is. He knew Sam Baffert was a good man.
He said he was just going up to talk to him. He said...  I want to be put on this case.
They have nothing to do with this --
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
Because I took it out of your memory.
As long as it's not 'what's your sign?'
This is how you pick up women --
Do you believe in miracles?
You were right.
The guests are here.
Guests?
It's not real.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
Yes, but only in the dream they call life.
It's his nature.
How long 'till we can eject?
The maze has been changed --
Get some internal police there. Tell them to run a perimeter.
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Need the disk back!
We worked together on the inside. You were on my programming team --
I know.
But you were with me.
I'm sorry.
Access granted.  Male or female?
WE CAN'T BREAK FREE!
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
I can hardly walk...
Release the power WITH the power.
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
Two thirty three a.m.
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
Look closer.
But boss, what about their parents?
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
If it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. We got friends in Philly. They can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
You scare me, Charlie.
Up down. Down up. It's the same. You see things through both eyes.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Mad Dog Coll's in town on a job.
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Mr. Costello handles our business with the government agencies.
I was calling yesterday.
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
We're going to Atlantic City for the honeymoon.
Like a party for all our friends.
Come off it, Bugs.
He's trying to make it.
If I wanted ta kill ya, I woulda done it long ago. It's not like you ain't given me reason.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
The kid just called me stupid.
You get fifteen percent.
That's why I'm here.
You disrespect our tradition.
And if I had known, I would have warned you to expect this. We could have prepared.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
The Big Picture.
Wanna know what I think?
Luciano is dead?
That a Jew compliment?
Best we got.
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
But only on purpose, Tommy.
Uhh - martini?
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.
Three months. <i></i> There's always some brain damage. But at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
What's the matter?
I can't believe you. You used to hate being the center of attention. Now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
Tell me what?
It's a special kind of party. A <u>farewell</u> party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At least he had a chance to give you the ring.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
Behind the books.
I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, that has nothing to do with it.
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Aaron?
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Well, bye.  And have a safe trip ... and ... Paris in the spring!
And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up.  So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year.
What happened?
Uh, yes.  My husband passed away recently ...
I see.  How much?
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
Thanks very much, sonny--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
It was?
Never.
But it *isn't*?
Let's send out a pigeon!
That old standing offer from Diz Moore--Poet of Washington Correspondents.
Huh?
I would cherish you--and stay sober.
You got worms.
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
What do I play?
Paine.
Oh--yeah--
Yeah.
Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote in here again. I told you to keep him out!
No. How'd you feel? Quick.
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take--  Say--who started this?
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Good idea. When?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
You said it!
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
All right, why?
Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them immediately--immediately!  I can't hold them off! They want something to say about this appointment. Ten to one they've got a man.
--a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser-- to the United States Senate!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
The--head?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Just a minute, I better make sure.
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
Mr. President!
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
Well, then--I--I don't feel I can stay, sir.
Jeff, look--didn't you say something to the papers about wanting to create a National Boys' camp? Were you in earnest about that?
Jeff--listen--this was all taken up in the State Legislature and approved-- they're going to divert waters from up above--
Ah, now, that's better.
For a *question*.
And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like to have him--
Can't you?
Is--is something the matter?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
And with your help--
Tonight.
Why?
We're over in the House.
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Try sitting down.
Well, anyway, it's *something* like that--  And it *is* important. That--that Steering Committee has *got* to see it that way. And I'm sure Senator Paine will do all he can--  He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't he? He knew my father, you know.
Since sixteen or so.
Letitia.
Lena.
I've got more. You better tell me.
Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.  Well, Saunders--let's go--
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
What you *have* to do is fight!
Oh--Saunders--
Sure.
Uh--Mr. President--you and I are about to be alone in here, sir. I'm not complaining for social reasons, but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen missed any of this.  Mr. President--I call the chair's attention to Rule Five of the Standing Rules of the Senate Section Three. "If it shall be found that a quorum is not present, a majority of the Senators present--," and that begins to look like me--"may direct the Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if necessary *compel* the attendance of the absent Senators."  Mr. President--*I so direct*.
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
Chick--
Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
Susan!
Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* of reporters and *lots* of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
Yeah?  And what else?
What do you want, Senator?
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
*Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and *fight* for him!
Joe--I've got a lot of people to take care of in this State.
We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought the land around this Dam and we're holding it in dummy names. If we drop it or delay it--we are going to bring about investigations, and investigations will show that we own that land and are trying to sell it to the State under phoney names. No, Joe, in my judgment the only thing to do is push this Dam through--and get it over with.
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.
Jim!
You can't say *that* to--
His first 'whiff'!
Mr. President...
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Never can tell what he's going to do.
He sure is pixilated.
He's still pixilated.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Oh, thank you!
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
What happened?
Sure. I met you.
What did they say?
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
He did?
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
A girl?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
Hello, Mary?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
When're you going to see him again?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?  What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he—
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
I tell you that dame's nuts.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
Perfect! Perfect!
Come on, John. What happened?
Relatives of old man Semple.
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
All set.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Yes.
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Have a drink?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Uh-huh. What are they?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
What's that?
Why's that?
What an asshole!
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Mr. Follett.
Stop now.
-- and you told me that. Still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, I think, getting in your way --
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I've had my moments.
A little.
Tastes good.
Yes, your honor.
I'm sorry, your honor.
I'd better get in there.
How long you been in this town?
Horror show. What'd you do tonight?
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Hello, Lionel.
But you know how to drive?
I been drivin' since I was twelve.
That would explain it.
I'm trying.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.
Well, look who's here...
Could I see Sofie, please?
When did you start to feel this way?
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
We'll turn back anytime you want.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
Either one.
Yeah?
That's... good?
Is something wrong, Sofie?
Will you wait for me?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever...  Which we already knew...
What do you want me to see?
What'd he say?
This is great!
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something...
Guess.  Go ahead, guess!
Really?
Damn! What is your name?
Sounds like you have several.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
And the drugs?
That'd be Lily.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I'm honored.
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Forgive me, please. What a gracious thought. We must do that.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
Oh yes, of course.
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
C'mon, friend.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
In the necropolis, when I saw him, - alive,... walking, he called me Anck- su-namun. And then in Mister Burns' quarters he tried to kiss me.
I'm willin, to go on a little faith, here.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
You bastards!
Twenty.
No.
No?
You two!
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
I'm not?
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
I'm staying.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
Jonathan?
Right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. Everybody knows the story. The entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. On Pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.
You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes!
That just makes you more gullible.
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?
Um-hmm.
And what's that?
That I've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
We didn't think this through very well.
Hey, do I look like a Man?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
He was cute though.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
He'll never make it.
That boy's got talent.
Are you with me... or against me?
You're dead.
Really?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
Or talk?
Monica... I was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- I mean you and I -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- I mean have a...
It is?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
What are you talking about?
And smell a little funny. We're not bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... This is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! So I say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
You sure that's how you spell it?
There's a big difference.
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Let's go.
The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. Twenty years ago they were Casanova's personal bodyguard. But after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
So where's the art?
What's that?
So what can I get you?
Oh hi, Mom.
I always knew that you were special.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
And, what a delightful idea!
I'm glad you like it.
Whatever suggested the idea to you?
Yes -- who spoke up?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Things are quite serious, I should say.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Unhappily, it is true, sire.
She should have had Larrey or Corvisart.  They might have saved her... But why didn't anyone even write to me?  Can you believe that no one even bothered to write to me? Would you have believed that I should read such news in a newspaper?  How incredible!
Ah, my poor Josephine.  She was the most alluring, most glamorous creature I have ever known -- a woman in every sense of the word, and she had the kindest heart in the world.  She may have been a liar and a spendthrift, but she had something that was irresistible -- she was a women to her very fingertips... How impossible it is to believe that she is dead.
Thank you, sir.
A glass of champagne, please.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
You don't know many of Citizen Barras' friends, do you?
Just a minute, General.  Listen, don't let them fool you with all their grand la-de-da.  They've all made their money from the war -- mostly from crooked war contracts. They say Citizen Barras has put away millions.
When you eat him, may I have some?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
What is that?
Ah, my dear Francis, what a genuine pleasure it is to meet you at last.
I'm sorry that I am unable to offer you better hospitality, but this is the only place I have inhabited for the past month.
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Thank you.
Please, sir, come into bed or I shall die of a chill.
Well, you shall see.
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
May I offer you a drink?
No.
Were you in love with any of them?
I will be there in five minutes.  Go back to your guests.
Yes!!
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
Good day, monsieur.  Do you think it is possible for you to tell your driver to stop ringing that bell?
My regrets, my dear Major, but I believe you have been blocking the road.
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Do you like music?
Will it be possible to have my dog, Bijou, sent here?  I was not allowed to bring her and I love her so much.
England can make no move against you on the Continent without Austria.  A reliable treaty with Austria would end her hopes in that regard.
Good day to our brothers-in-arms. Have you come to join us?
Then do you propose to arrest all of us, Citizen Lieutenant?  For I was not there alone.
Just tell him to come over here and talk to me.
And I can go free?
Hey, Debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
Why you say that?
What you mean talk to her?
Yeah it is...the best day before the weekend.
That's cron-don, sir.  My mom hates for me to smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?
It's about to work, just come on.
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
You straight?
Just a little.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
Who is that?
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
$247.
Thanks a lot, Craig.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
You make it sound so easy.
Wait.
That pump was full of money.  I saw where they put it.  Stay right here, I'mma climb in and go get it.
Hello, remember me?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Delivery!
Can I help you?
What's the matter?
What it smell like?
Craig, remember what I told you.
Excuse me?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I don't know.  I hope Craig got a good idea.  We gotta ask him when he comes out.  Let's go and clean up before Pinky gets here.
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
I'm not letting nothing go.  They killed my board.
Roach...Roach, come on.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
What the fuck you looking at?
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
Rancho Cucamonga?
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
Just do it.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
Hey, how you get out of here.
I'll take you later.
Huh?
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
And your husband works for somebody else.
I would also like to apologize.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Are you 'fucking with me!?
It wasn't loaded. I didn't put the bullets in it.
I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work.
How am I supposed to get away?
Again.
Don't you threaten me.
I don't know.
The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right?
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Not just yet, baby. There's...there's something Daddy has to do.
I'm just an accountant.
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
I remember. The big tipper.
I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect...
Then why'd you drag me into it?
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
Meet Irene.
Thanks for the shine.
Fuckin' A.
Close your eyes.
Somebody mind telling me... ) What the hell happened!?
Get moving.
That one.
Foreigners! Fuck!
You don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.
No, Ben.
You was quotin' Scripture. You said -- you said, "And a little child shall lead them."
What religion do you profess, Preacher?
Keep talkin', Preacher.
I been mindin' Pearl.
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Here's your can o' hooks, Uncle Birdie.
I'll light the lamp.
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
Just went?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Twenty-five wives!
He lied!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
What!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
Why?
It's all here.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
Dead.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
All right...  Come along.
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
O no! Your turn!
Can I have milk too?
About our secrets.
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
No. No one never did.
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Didn't you have no inkling?
The first night?
I was praying.
You're Miz Cooper, I take it.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
What do you want?
The Drugstore?
He never asked me for nothin'.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Okay, good. She's asleep.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
It's just a stupid cat.
What the hell's going on!?
One two, Freddie's coming for you? No. Rod killed Tina. He's a fruitcake and you know it.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
No.
What happens if they don't do that?
You do?
My dream.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
How you know that?
Where you think you're going?
I won't.
No, Mother. Yes, Mother. No, Mother.
Oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and Fred Krueger was free, just like that.
Just sleep now, Mom.
Feeling better?
And then what happened?
What you dream?
What the hell you doing here?
No more fights.
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
From Leon.
Good evening, Anna.
Aren't you late?
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
What are you serving?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
And you too, Ninotchka.
I have nothing to hide.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
What was it like?
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
An evening gown.
What do you wear in the morning?
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
That's her.
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
He's cutting our throat...
That must be the one!
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Monsieur.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Your breakfast, monsieur.
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Count d'Algout...
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
It's a real Paris reunion.
What proposition?
Comrade Buljanoff...
A cow?
Bad news?
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
Allow me, Comrade.
Yes, Comrade.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
What business?
She must have her little joke.  You're not going to take that seriously.
No visa.
Me?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
That's a strange angle.
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Is that customary?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
The telephone is ringing.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Comrades! Comrades!
I must talk to my brothers!
Much happier.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Hello.
That does it, Swana.  Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
I told you to go, madame.
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
Unfortunately.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
Good morning, Comrade.
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
I don't understand.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
We could check the tape again, sir.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
Jesus, everything is a crisis among the upper intellectual types, the softheads.  The average people don't think it's much of a crisis.  For Christ's sake, it's not Vietnam ... no one's dying here.  Isn't it ridiculous?
No, we have nothing to hide.
I'm not going to be the scapegoat for this.  Haldeman and Ehrlichman are in just as deep as me.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
How so?
In hiding.  He sent Liddy to talk to me.
Pay him?  I told him to get out of the country.  It's crazy to start ...
No, sir.
No, you didn't, Bob.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
You're all set, sir.  Just push this button.  Good night, Mr. President.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
This could trigger the impeachment. They'll go to the Supreme Court next.
Sir, the deadline is today.
That was civil war.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
... they smelled the blood on me this time, Al.  I got soft.  You know ... that rusty, metallic smell ...
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
He wasn't protecting me.  He was putting me on notice.
Alright.  But why, if Kennedy is so clean in all this, didn't he cancel Track 2?
Sir?
I believe you're right, boss.
My God, my God!  He talked to the New York Times?
You know why they're turning on me? They're not serious about power, that's why.  They're playing with power.  They're forgetting the national interest.  In the old days, people knew how to hold power, how to set limits.  They wouldn't have torn this country apart over a third-rate burglary. All they care about now are their egos, looking good at cocktail parties ...
You played it perfectly, sir -- cocksucker!  He's going to think twice before he leaks again.
We've got to turn the faucet off on this thing.  It's out of control ...  You might burden just me with this in the future.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
... There can be no whitewash at the White House ... two wrongs do not make a right.  I love America.  God bless America and God bless each and every one of you.
Richard ... come with me, would you ...
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd he say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And me? ...
Yes.
No.
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
Yeah, well, as I said, Edgar ...
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
He's obsessed with his own image.  He wants his Nobel Peace Prize a little too much.  As the late "Doctor" King proved -- even an ape can win a prize with good press.
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Thanks, Jack.  You sure throw a helluva party.
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Exactly, yes, Mr. President.  That is my contention.
If they harass you, I, too, will resign.  And I will tell the world why.
You know, Mr. Chairman, at Harvard I used your writings in my class.
What a waste of time.  My writings mean absolutely nothing.
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Why?
You just came down here for the weather, right, Mr. Nixon?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
... Use his women.
Where you from?
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
Come on, man -- Vietnam ain't Germany. It doesn't threaten us.  It's a civil war between the Vietnamese.
Hi.
Yeah, she lives in Dallas ...
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
You're ruining us.  If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you.  This isn't political, Dick.  This is our life.
Everything's political, for Christ's sake!  I'm political.  And you're political, too!
No.  It's his way.  He hates me.  Him and Teddy.  They always hated me.
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they?  New Hampshire ...
Then I'll be there for you.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
He looked old, didn't he?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years.  What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
How you been, Ellis?
You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older.
'Predate it.
That man that shot you died in prison.
When did he die?
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you.
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
All that at the Eagle Hotel. It's beyond everything.
Would you tell me if you had?
It's not me he's in trouble with.
He won't neither. He never has.
Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story.
Carla Jean...
...You ride Winston.
What about yours?
What was the bullet?
No sir.
Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans.
Maybe I'll go ridin.
No. But I gave my word.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
So... for how long do we have to...
Llewelyn --
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Yes ma'am?
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
You don't know to a certainty. Twenty minutes it could be here.
Yessir?
Airport.
What way would that be?
With what?
What time do you close?
I could come back then.
Well... I need to close now --
Yes.
You already have the tent?
Somethin' like that.
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
...Keep going. Don't stop.
Yessir, that's correct. I know 'em when I see 'em.
...I'm wondering...
Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
I been immobile.
I'm retired.
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
No I don't have it.
You do, I reckon.
Are you jackin' with me?
Are you in the service?
Yes sir. Two tours.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Did you send anyone out there?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Yeah?
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Oww, the arm, the arm!
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
No, I was just... How you doing?
They're fine... you miss it?
Who are these idiots?
I'd rather not...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, Betty --
No... what about your sister?
The LeSabre!
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I guess we all did.  You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
What happened when you were twelve?
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
Uh-huh.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Roy! What are you doing here?
I'd slap his face.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
No. Loma Vista.
I'll go to the Hospital.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
She called you 'George,' George.
It's something I had to do. For David.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Doctor David Ravell.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Why'd you help me in the first place?
What are those for?
Looking for someone?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Rosa, so you've met David?
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
That's right.
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here...  Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
What'd you get her?
Seems like a nice place.
Jesus Christ!
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
I'll think about it.
Hmm?
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Would you say she was ambitious?
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Huh?!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.
Four hundred, Delmar.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Y'ignorant slope-shouldered sack a guts!  Why we'd look like a buncha satchel-ass Johnnie-Come-Latelies braggin' on our own midget! Don't matter how stumpy! And that's the goddamn problem right there - people think this Stokes got fresh ideas, he's oh coorant and we the past.
Latch right on to that tit.
Devil his due.
Reason why he's pullin' ah pants down.
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Pullin' ah pants down...
Enticements a power, wealth, settera.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Hell, now's the time to buy it off him cheap.
That's not my ring.
You said -
Uh-huh.
A 9,000-hectacre lake, honey.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
That don't make no sense!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Yeah, I know.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Vietnam?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Everything was different.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
You stayed after all.
You're better than candy.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
You okay?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
You're welcome.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
The walls are steel, right?
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Where did you get this clown?
Yes.  Yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  You fuck.  Now how are you gonna get us into that room?
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Hey.
'Bout four o'clock.
One day you will learn to respect other people's time, Lydia, one day you --
The hotel guy?  It's been in the papers lately.  His kids are all suing each other over his estate. He was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  Somebody took something didn't belong to them!
No fucking way.
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Don't take no tone of voice with me, Homes.
Nobody leaves.
What?!
Nope.
Strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
Why?
Uhh... I with it sister but...
So... we understand each other Judge?
Go! Run! Go on! Get the fuck out of here!!
Well don't go forgetting your friends.
Sabu... High white dude's the only thing you could hustle.
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Hey, this what they got you doing now?
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
...Glad you came man.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
Naw... I gotta...
Are you finished?
I don't think that will be any problem...
From what you saw, did Huey Newton start the shooting?
We're working on that...
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
Get the brothers a beer. Me too while you're at it.  Men? Well we can spare six for security...
What, I don't know how you mean?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
And you're gonna do just that. But I'll tell you what to feed the pig. You alright with this?
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
Just a kid.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
If you got something to say, say it.
Fuck is up?!
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah... Look man, what I gotta say. It's just you, me and the rats, right? Alright... well... Sabu's back.
You don't look alright.
Late summer.
I know who you are, Gabriel Marion. The last time I saw you, I was nine and you put ink in my tea.
Next time we'll bring more blankets.
Cheerful news to greet the morn.
Thomas is dead but you've done nothing for which you should be ashamed.
Excuse me?
I'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled.
Oh.  Very well, then.  Would you, as the initiating party, like to begin?
Colonel, imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other.  There must be gentlemen in command to lead and, when appropriate, restrain their men.
It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.
Thirteen years...
That's what I'm doing.  I will not fight and because I won't, I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte's farm.  She's to the west.
But what about Thomas?
Worse.
Please hurry.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
I've noticed it, too. I'll cough up the money, Ellen.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Do you swear?
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Hey--they actually found the place!
Not at all.
I can hardly read these.
Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days?
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?
Going to tell Ellie?
Micmacs used to call it Little God Swamp.
Almost there, Louis.
This was their burying ground, Louis.
Doesn't look like they last long.
Don't worry about that.
What did we do, Jud?
Wouldn't wash?
Yes.
Gage's gone!
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
You've got one shot -- and we can't die.
Allow me the humor of listening to your terms.
The Pearl?  Oh, that's fine.  And just how do you expect this to work?
Wait as long as you like.
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
You can go to your grave not knowing.
You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
That so?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
You have a name, missy?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
Man overboard!
On his heels!  Gillette, bring a squad down from the fort!  Elizabeth, are you --
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
Then I can wear men's clothing.
You are despicable.
You?!
Nothing ... it's nothing.  Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child.  A song about pirates.
You -- you burned up the island, for a one-time chance at being spotted?
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
Make it last, then.  Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?
I'm going after the Black Pearl. I know where it's going to be, and I'm going to take it.
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
A fool's errand.
It's a signal.  If we resist, it won't just be death.  There'll be torture as well.
Sir!  Shall I break out the cannons?
But it seems to be enough to condemn him.
We had time to get to know each other.
You would do that?
Somewhat.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
It's not true my father was a pirate.
Depends.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
You can't mean that.
What are you going to do to him?
What did you use?
... plastic.
Please, O'Brien, don't do this to me!  I'll give you anything you want!
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
Then you still love me?
Poppy, please --
Okay.  Alright.  Okey-dokey.  Now, we need the nanobot.  The nanobot that initiated the reaction.  Once we have that we can stabilize the meltdown.  Simple really.  No problem.
Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back --
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Of course, sir.
Is that what Argon told you?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
Yeah.
... just like the mouse.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
I don't consider uncontrollable toxic waste progress!
I could go with you.
No cheese.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think?  It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
You saved my life.
We've got to get the nanobot.
That means the nanobot is still inside him.
I have to!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
I could have you fired right now.
May I use your telephone?
For what?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
I'm not going!
Anne, come here. Listen—
I see.
I should say you had. At the rate you two are going, we'll have to leave the country to save our faces.
That's an excellent idea.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Ah-ah-ah!
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Say, take it easy! Take it easy! Listen, my boy. No use you hanging around here. Just buy the Tribune tonight and read all about it. You can rewrite it for your last edition.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. By golly, I'm surely glad to see that you're not really sore. You know our racket - after all, news is news.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
Come on, get going, get going!
What play?
My play.
The boss is getting hoarse.
You what?
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Hello, Stew.
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
What do you know about Conrad?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
What other girl—?
A statement? Good.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Well, at best you might deny it.
I beg your pardon.
Sure.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
But I—
Found no skeletons?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Yes.
She's crying.
I've got to go ...
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
... And you always seemed so smart and everything. Like that report you did on "Our Town Hall." Gosh. I didn't know what I'd talk to you about.
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
It is?
So.
Okay, that's IT!!!
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
That's not going to happen!
Oh, no thanks ...
No. What?
No. They do. And it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... They respect you ...
Well--it was dark out ...
It was accessible to everyone.
It's not in ME.
What?
As a matter of fact he does.
Can we do any better?
I could like kill a guy with these things.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
What did you do to him?
Well if I don't who will?
They're happy like this.
Me too. Sounds swell.
It's okay.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Can I ask you a question?
I told you. I'm like positive.
And you're sure about this?
Keeps going ...
So what's it like?
What?
What's going on?
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Oh sure you do ... "McIntire's Department store" ... "Their father dressed as Prince Charming." That was gorgeous Bud.
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Excuse me?
Why?
Hope you're proud of yourself.
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
Really?
Hi.
Yeah ...
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I feel really on the spot now.
No she didn't; that's a lie.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Do you like porno movies?
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
It doesn't matter.
Georgia.
Yes.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
No. I'm sorry.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
-- you said you did.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Yeah, not really.
Alright?
....Hi.....
How long have you known her?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
If you come to Hawaii --
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Yeah.
Lena?
I just wanted to make sure.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Where you married?
For work.....
How many times have you been on an airplane?
I think maybe over a hundred.
I'm sorry.
Ok, bye, bye.
Why?
Well who did?
You're hand is bleeding.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Please don't do this to me.
Yes it is.
Barry Egan.
337.....I'm sorry....
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
Now are you threatening me, dick?
You better watch your mouth, cunt, you're gonna get hurt.
Hi Walter.
And I'm sorry that I did that.
Like a psychiatrist?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Yes I'm fine.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
What is this?
Good morning, Barry....
No thanks.
What's up?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
....now: this pudding?
Where you been?
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Ok.
I know.
We should be going --
No.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
Should I call you later?
You've been to his quarters, haven't you?
At your service, Count.
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Ow!
Free his mouth.
I must grant him his last rites.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Don't confuse one organ with another --
I'm here.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
Of course.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You're a sentimental man.
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Here it is; the last chapter.
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
Most assuredly.
It's a long story, this one.
Go on, child.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
-- words alone are insufficient.
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Leave at once --
Ever met Walter Winchell?
I wonder sometimes.
You're just scared.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
My name is Orson Welles
In Hollywood the fiercest bulls are the most brutally killed.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
I will not defend my life to you--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
You will not walk out on me
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Sir, I-
Keep filming.
We're using-
Schaefer, I gotta see this Welles picture
Louella, hello, I was just fixing a drink, would you like--?
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
What are movies about, Orson?
Showing life
Magic
Sigmund Freud?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
They don't have to.
I don't give a shit about-
Well, at least she's off KANE today
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
Shit
Oh God.
Herman.
You're going to destroy it
Yes
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
"Rosebud? I'll tell you about Rosebud.
Jesus
This is an abomination There's no music and--
Then find another theater
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
This looks done.
It's not done.
What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
Say what you're gonna say.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.
I can't eat a steak. If I eat a steak, I'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? You and him been friends a long time.
But you said "you."
Whatsa matter with you?
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.
I'll give you anything you want, Jake. I think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
It feels real good.
Can you see it?
No.
Take off my pants.
I was just...
Nobody. I love you, remember?
I never noticed his face.
What'd you see?
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
Are you drunk?
The kids are sleeping.
I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
I said, let's go.
No, you're his wife.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
He has it. Thank you.
I'll pull somebody out of Japan.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
She never left the apartment --
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Who said they left then?
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Read some good books.
It's me.
Something wrong?
No.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
Lisa Fremont.
Stella!
There's probably one in the basement.
Smart girl.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Ten here.
How's your leg?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Three.
I have one now.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Yeah.
To get on home.
That's what the witnesses told him.
That's a suitcase?
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
But you're not?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Meaning me?
What?
Just him.
Any other entrance?
What time is it?
Mother--
You make any sandwiches?
Have some cigars.
Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?  Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
No.  I don't think so--
What?
What?
Jim.  What's yours?
I'm here.
How'd you get here?
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
I'm here.  Shut up.
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
When was that?
When I was here?  When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
In your pocket.  Give it to me.
Just a guard.
Get lost.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Go on--don't give me that.  Someone giving you hard looks?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
So then you moved?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Where I saw you.  Everything going okay now?  You live around here?
Where's Dawson High School?
Yeah--why--
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Sure.  Lots of times.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
It is for me too.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
Do you think your father means that?
What?
Didn't you forget something?
Gabriel -- !
Gabriel, let him go --
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
What.
Had some bad relationships, didn't you.
Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
Nick, I love you --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
You told him about Nick's letters.
You're in on this.
I thought we'd have a few more days.
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Nick, what are you talking about?
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
No.
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Bam Bam.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
This isn't the Tomahawk.
What the fuck are you talking about.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through?
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Get in the CAR!
Mister. I'm begging, 'kay? I'm begging. This is not some card club, 'kay? This is the Tomahawk. We're an international gaming destination. We're in guidebooks. You can't do this... you can't do this to me...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
Hi, Santa Claus, how are you. He's with Sears, I'm with Wal-Mart, twas the season...
Fuckin' freezing.
Five years. Since it opened.
What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!
Monsters in the gelatin...
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Ain't there yet.
Oh.
Mornin', gorgeous. More egg nog?
All I want... is to make it to Sidnaw, and sit down for Christmas dinner. Watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley?
But... I had a five...
What? No...
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
Without having them hit the alarms.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
Seymour Scagnetti.
I don't wanna lift crates.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Let me tell you guys a story. In one of daddy's clubs there was this black cocktail waitress named Elois.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.
I was in the sixth grade when that show was on. I totally dug it. What the fuck was the name of the chick who played Christie Love?
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
What?
You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
What the fuck are you talking about?
What's this guy's problem?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
All this blood is scaring the shit outta me. I'm gonna die, I know it.
Yeah, it's fuckin' great isn't it?
Dead.
That's not correct.
Tagged a couple of cops. Did you kill anybody?
That was one of the most insane fucking things I've ever seen. Why the fuck would Joe hire somebody like that?
I think he's a sick fuckin' maniac! We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us, when he shot up the place. I came this fucking close -  to taking his ass out myself. Everybody panics. When things get tense, everybody panics. Everybody. I don't care what your name is, you can't help it. It's human nature. But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.
What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional. A psychopath is not a professional. You can't work with a psychopath, 'cause ya don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next. I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was? Twenty, maybe twenty-one?
You gotta idea, spit it out.
And what was tellin him your name when you weren't supposed to?
Okay, Mr. Expert. If this is such a truism, how come every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
What's she doin' runnin' around the country at night.
And this is Helen Carter.
So that was why she tried to run away.
He knows his alphabet.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
All right -- it's said!
All my clothes --
It's going to Sonora.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
How does she draw?
That's right.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
I've got eleven horses.
Yeah, it does.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Go away -- please.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
What's the matter -- restless?
Some people who went by this way lost it.  Two men and some women. They packed their stuff on horses and went on.
And you're all alone.
Everybody knows --
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
Would you like to learn them?
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
What comes after Z?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Hello Brenda.
Shhh... It's okay.
No, stay.
Yeah.
Hi Buddy.
Buddy...
That we should take our friendship a little further?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Feel that?
Okay, I get the point.
So, whatever happened to her?
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
I'm Cindy.
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Stop! --
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Both of them?
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Oh.
Got a problem with that?
I take it you're not mad at me.
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something?
I finished all the interviews.
That's Ray Williams. I couldn't quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
What the hell?!
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
You never could feel your legs.
A little bit... Give me your belt.
You're not wearing a belt.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Father.
Because she will lie?
I woke up naked, too.
Hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
"Fucked me."
Oh, boy! 
...Jenner... Jenson, Emy Lou Jenson. 3511 Clark Avenue!
No comment!
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
There you go. I love Bill Cosby pictures.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
I'm so happy I could shit.
Time to get up, that's all. You'll be late for work.
Are you Chip Sutphin?
We hope so, son. And no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
You've been working in that video shop too long.
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
Don't I get a kiss?
It's fine with me, Beverly.  You want to, honey? You think the kids are asleep?
Don't wake the kids...
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Det. Bradford, I'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house. 
"P" as in...
You bitch!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
It's sugarless.
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
...Browsing.
Yes... but... I didn't...
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
What is it, Betty?
Yes, ma'am, it is.
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
Yes, I understand.
Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Good.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
But I understand her. That may be more important.
Well?
I don't know.
Why wait?
And then?
Please, Jacqueline.
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
And Gregory -- he loves her.
Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
I wouldn't want to take them out. I just want to look at them.
I hope it finds as much favor as your other book -- but somehow I doubt it -- the time is out of tune.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
I don't suppose you'll ever tell her, will you?
What?
Cloven hoof?
Would they hurt her?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'll be out in a minute.
If I were you, Mary -- I'd go back to school. I'd make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.
I don't believe it.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Why
Do you have other things?
Yeah, I guess it is. My mother is a complete Anglophile, anything British makes her drool like a baby. She probably heard the name in some movie. She's a prisoner of public television now.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
You play an instrument?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
...free-lance. You know.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Kids? What about them?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
What?
Hi!
Yes.
No.
Why not?
No, not to me, for me, for the camera.
I know.
Why not?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
I have money.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
So you do fantasize?
I fantasized about you.
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
No, it was wonderful. That wasn't the problem.
How come?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Yes.
Possibly.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
I can't tell you like this.
Why are you ashamed?
Yes. I just got busy.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Why?
No, I didn't.
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
Radon leakage?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
You understand that you are free to leave therapy at any time?
Yes.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
Well, I wonder why.
I just thought it might --
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
No, it's nothing like that.
Questions about sex.
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
No, but I did.
In front of him, Ann, yes.
I can't believe you did that!!
Here it is.
It looks like a tablecloth.
There's a phone here.
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
Nope.
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
I just want to ask you questions.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Do you like the way I look?
Yes.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
Why?
Could be risky.
Hello.
Hello.
What's so stupid about it?
Right.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Look, are we going to do it or not?
No.  You said three-fifty?
She's not property, John, she's a person. Were you just going to keep right on lying to her?
God, you need help.
Have you ever wanted to make love to someone other than your husband?
John Millaney.
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
So you just came up to visit this Hobbes and you found them like that?
And that was her. Annabelle Horse... field.
Is that the man who called you up here?
Oh, Nick, Nick... I can't take this.
What happened?
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Did I say anything?
He didn't make it.
Huh?
NIGHT NIGHT
But...how?
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Care to indulge?
He was a President.
He was adopted you know.
It's only one night, Janet. Let's not forget who we're doing this for?
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
I'm sorry, Officer.
Just one or two details.  Does he have any living relatives? Blood relatives?
Me?
. . .For his own good.
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
This is the nerve center of operations, Janet.  You must stay here tonight.  That way we can all be here when Mr. Sun paints us a new day with his golden brush.
WHAT A JOKE...
HE LEAVES YOU SMOKING...
Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
Actually there is word. I spoke to Keith Kurtzman this morning.
And?
So I guess that's it.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
What are you pouring tonight?
Highliner.
Bottle.
Well, you were wonderful on that show. I never understood why they had to give you that brain tumor so soon. Why that didn't make you the biggest movie star in the world is a sin. It's a sin.
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
Stephanie.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
Are you a writer too?
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Um... seventy... something.
That's your problem, Miles.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
Whoa.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
Uh-huh.
You know that chick?
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Have you no shame?
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
What do you think?
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Nice shot.
Been checking your messages?
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
You know what I'm thinking?
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
What?
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
The plan is... you go.
I'm fine. You rest.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You want to join us?
Is she sleeping or...?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Victoria.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
So how're you doing?
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
About four weeks.
See you, Miles. You take care.
It was a surprise, Mom.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
This one?
The same windows.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
It's probably picking up another baby monitor.
What time is it?
The bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
Where are you going?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Merrill!
These are D's; I need double A's.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
Stop crying!
They'll read our minds!
I can't even imagine.
It's not broken.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
It's good advice...  Say hi to Marcia for me.
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
What book!
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.
That's why they got you in jail?
What friend is that?
After the war my family worked a little piece of land near Savannah for a while. But the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. Finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. By that time I was so sick of farming, I didn't want to touch another hoe ever. I wouldn't come with 'em. My daddy took it pretty hard. Him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. They've got a little place south of Silverado. I guess they've done okay. Good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. That was almost nine months ago she wrote. Letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
I just came out to say goodbye.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
Looks like that's not all they admired.
They got a saloon there?
He is that.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
No hard feelings.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Kelly, get over here.  You didn't come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  Kelly, meet my friend Paden.
Howdy.
You wanted to see me?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Why come to me?
Why are they doing this, Mal?
He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
So we understand each other?
I'm going to have to look into this.
You work here?
It's the only place I'm happy.
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Why'd you go into business with him?
Is this a fair mix?
What do you mean?
I like your attitude. But it can be risky.
I've got a place I can hide her.
That was my plan.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
Thanks.  This is my exit so, I --
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
Where is she?
I can't wait to meet her.
Really?  Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
What about it?
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Better late than never.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Elaine, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go somewhere -- dinner?
... Simone.
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
-- She's a figment of my own imagination.  I, Viktor Taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight-of-hand, sleight-of-mouth, sleight-of- sleight in entertainment history! And still no one appreciates me, recognizes what I've done -- even you.
... so much like her?
What?... What did you say?
Do what you do to Simone.
Simone?
How will you do our love scenes?
For her?
There's... a wall between you --
I know what you mean.
I have her, Mr. Taransky.  The answer to your prayers.  The answer to this.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I don't know anything about computers.
You do?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
There was no other way.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
Okay, Dad.
If anyone asks about Simone --
Good-night, Daddy.
I do okay.  How about you?
Dinner?  Dinner's difficult.  A phone call?
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
Do I know you?
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
She sounds like a prisoner, Taransky.  Are you holding her hostage?  Are you some kind of Svengali?
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
24-hour tail on Taransky?
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Long live the First Amendment.
Mr. Sayer...
What if it catches on fire?
Maybe he can.
You did create me.
The only real truth is in the work.
--My God.
Are you calling me?
That's very sweet. I'm okay.
Don't step in the horse manure.
Dr. Crowe.
What'd you write?
Dr. Crowe.
Yes.
Yes?
When they get mad, it gets cold.
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
They want me to do things for them.
What?
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
I don't like people looking at me like that.
What--
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
Your grandfather sure believed in it. Worked pretty good... too.
Chicken blood on the crops.
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Bitch.
No. This is something spiritual. An ambition.
Suzie???
Hey, isn't that the preacher?
Gene.
Hell, no. But you missed a damn good sermon. "You can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the Lord."
Sounds familiar.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
Fine. Be that way. Jim Morrison.
Well, there goes our record deal.
You're out of your mind, man.
"Old Macdonald... had --"
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Then who?! Because someone wants another blood harvest. With human blood, Jeremiah! Just like Jethro! Who did he kill back then, Jeremiah? Farmhands? Transients? People no one would miss? "Crazy Old Macdonald!" But now... it's starting again, isn't it? Someone's picking up where Jethro left off!
Hey. Some Klu Klux Klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
Name something.
You wouldn't understand.
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Suzie... No.
You brought us here. And that morning I found you in the barn. You had scratches on your face --
Bill, we need to talk!
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Touch some deer feces out in the forest. Eat a sandwich without washing your hands. Then you got lyme disease.
Sorry.
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
Rorschach.
Slugs? No. 'Less you talkin' about that new waitress down at Sloan's! Ha ha!
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
All the rib eyes?
I never danced in a towel before.
I'll get if for you.
Ain't no mystery to it. She's raised in them shanties off St. Luc. Dirt--poor.
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
So tell me about yourself.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
You have a great profile.
What the hell are you doing?!?
You know this guy, don't you?
I would've come back for you.
Yeah.
My very words.
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
Why are you stopping?
One to five?
What's your pleasure?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Go.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Just don't worry about it.  How we doin' timewise?
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Go breaker.
Go head on, breaker.
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
Is that Bandit in the lead?
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
C'mon Bill... you've got some Sultan up there, one of your whales, big- spender, likes a lot of space, you cook up this "construction" thing...?
No, no, no. We've been looking to renovate that area of our hotel for some time now. The security team is only present to preserve floor integrity, due to the roof access.
Unreal, this guys jacket too. Wall- to-wall major felony offenses, murder, extortion, arson, grand larceny --  -- A paternity suit... I just feel like we're playing catch-up with all this and we shouldn't be.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
Two of 'em?
Thass' right.  I got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.
I got it made in the shade Amigo. Hey, I'll see you up here some day, don't worry.
No. Sorry comes later, when you're in a partial coma with ambulatory paralysis. Sorry comes when we have to decide which of your limbs have to be amputated because severely constricted blood flow has brought about a gangrenous infection, sorry --
No, what did you say on the machine?
I could have it sent out...
I am. Yeah.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
-- You can and you will.
The agents of that era are all dead and gone, history had defaulted to fable... until now. You can imagine the shock this sent through the corridors of power in D.C. Heller's op predates the second world war. That's over sixty years of intel. Do you know how valuable that could be? The man's a treasure trove.
Buzzy... Buzz...?
Yeah... Sid?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
No shit.
Lil' cagey, y'know, don't like t'share trade secrets, that type'a thing.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
What!?
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
What?
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
You're not Gibarian...
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
That's fantastic.
It's not human, Kelvin.  Whatever it is, it's not human, and I am threatened by that.  Evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. And I want to win.  I want humans to win.  So I am killing it before it kills me.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
Gibarian warned me.  He left me a message.
Tell me.  I won't think you're insane.
She has materialized from your memory of her.  What was her name?
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
They come when you sleep.
Get out --
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you.  She will die.  Then what will you do?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
We're taking a flight?
Poem.  Dylan Thomas.  I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Not exactly.  It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time.  It was completely counter-intuitive.  We had to unlearn everything.
You still don't believe in God?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
What does Snow think you should do?
He has a point.
But that's what happened before.
What's wrong?
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
I can't stay here.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
I want you here.
I can't --
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
They are not autonomous individuals and they're not actual persons. They are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
You didn't like him?
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Uh...
Can we go then?
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Hey!  There are crazy people here.
I'll come with you.
I'm sorry about what happened.
He said he'd kill me.
Nope... never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
Claire, will you calm down?
Stop, will you?!
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
Do you dance?
You still going away?
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I'd identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?
You heard me.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I watched TV.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
You're here 'til what time?
I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
How do you know where the gun is?
Shooting?
And Flash isn't?
So, uh... how's college goin'?
I know.
No, no, listen. They're tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
Flash, drop it--
Now tell me you love me.
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Yeah--
Can't focus...
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
An even five I throw in the jacket.
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
He knew.
Even if they're not clever.
I hate the Platonic idea of you.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Maybe.  I could have stopped it, though.
You want to give them something, but they'll just buy more Ripple. And they smell so... bad.
But you like that in a man?
You should write that one down.
I'd never admit that.
I've gotta study.
Oh, don't do it on my account--
Am I?  I'm not so sure.  I used to be sure of a lot of things.  Oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I'm not sure of anything anymore.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
So you've found Thorkel?
Yeah, that's fascinating, but I'm just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
You sure about all this?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
It's Friday night...
Yes.  Do you have a date?
A match made in heaven.
Peter, you're bleeding.
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Where'd you get the clown suit?
I wouldn't talk about things like that.
What's wrong with him?
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
We made a deal with Barrack One.
Where's Hoffy? Why don't we get any news about Dunbar?
I had to be the ham! I had to shoot off my mouth!
That's right.
Then we're all in on it?
Come on, Schulz! Spill it! How did you get the information? About Manfredi and Johnson? About the stove and the tunnel? Who's giving it to you? Which one of us is it?
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Yeah.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
Jawohl?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
What's the award?
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Sugar-lips Shapiro! Frightening, ain't it?
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
What are you going to do?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
With your mother's pull, how come you're not a chicken colonel by now?
You starting that again?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Ach so!
Will you get this guy out of my hair so I can go?
Good morning, Sefton.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
I'll make it five hundred!
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Who's the other wrestler? The one with the mustache?
That is my wife.
The Captain would make a much more valuable hostage.
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
According to our current information, the destruction of the Amargosa star has had the following effects in this sector: gamma emissions have increased by .05 percent, the starship Bozeman was forced to make a course correction, a research project on Gorik IV was halted due to increased neutrino particles, ambient magnetic fields have decreased by-
He can't go to the ribbon, so he's trying to make the ribbon come to him.  Data, is it going to pass near any M-Class planets?
But at the first sign of trouble, I'm going to deactivate it. Agreed?
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Do you remember him?
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
This is the Nexus?
I am on the Enterprise. I am also here.  Think of me as an "echo" of the person you know. A part she left behind.
Yes, where would you go?
I know exactly where I want to go, and when. Back to that mountaintop on Veridian III, before Soran put out the star. I have to stop him.
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Beautiful day, isn't it?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.
And what would that be, sir?
Captain, it may be possible to simulate a torpedo blast using a resonance burst from the main deflector dish.
What's normal?
No, I didn't know that.
Imagine what it was like, Will. No engines, no computers, just the wind, the sea and the stars to guide you.
I'm afraid I can't just leave it at that. The commanding officer of this ship is clearly distraught about something. As ship's counselor, it's my duty to-
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
What if I told you I found a new truth?
It looks like we're too late.
Tractor beam, aye!
Oh no you don't! Regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." Can you guarantee that?
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
You must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
It's time for total truth between us.  This planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
... How long?
I don't understand.
I'll go...
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Captain, what's happening?!
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
How many more?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
See! That shimmering area.
The planet Vulcan. In hailing distance, sir.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
May I ask why...?
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
No, Jim! Enterprise would never stand the pounding.
Do not lecture me about treaty violations. The Federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of Intergalactic criminals. It is not I who will surrender, it is you.  On the planet below, I have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. If you do not surrender immediately, I will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
No.
Give me your hand and we both live.
Yes, I was...
... He spoke of your friendship.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
I am not sure. Only time will answer.  Kirk. I thank you. What you have done is --
Success, my lord.
They outnumber us, my Lord --
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
How is that...?
But dear Lord, are we intelligent enough to -- Suppose, this thing were used where life already exists?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
Are you out of your Vulcan mind? No human can tolerate the radiation loose in there!
But, as you are so fond of observing, Doctor, I'm not human.
You're not going in there -- !
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Shore leave, Admiral.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
I still don't under --
Repeat... what's wrong? What's wrong?
Carol!
David. Please.
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Where's Dr. Marcus --
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
It was just words.
What are you looking at?
Yours... is... the superior...
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Thirty seconds...
Time's up, Admiral...
She's not responding...
Admiral --
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Admiral, if we go by the book, like Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem like days.
Yes, SIR.
Oh do you? Have you any idea, Midshipman Preston, how many times I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on the Comm, telling me his troubles? Have you any idea the ribbing I've had to endure in the officers' mess to the effect that the Enterprise is a flying death trap?
Is the word given?
I know of your fondness for antiques.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
There are two possibilities, sir they are unwilling to respond, they are unable to respond.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
Carol Marcus --
They knew just where to hit us.
The prefix code?
A distinct possibility.
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
... the good of the few...
Because... there was no way to win.
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
Khan!
That was close --
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Cease fire. Look sharp.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Thank you, sir. I've looked forward to this for a long time.
Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
Prepare for warp speed.
I would accept that as an axiom.
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
That's crazy!
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
How long?
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Can you protect us?
You mean man...
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
We can't tell you.  Please, just -- let me finish. I can tell you that we're not in the military and that we intend no harm to the whales.
They'll be flown in a special 747 to Alaska and released there.
If you have such a low opinion of my abilities, how come we're having dinner?
Sorry, the time would have to be right now.
Don't tell me: you're from outer space.
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
We'll bring them up just like we brought you. It's called a transporter beam...
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Oh my God, we're too late!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Permission granted.
Where are you going?!
That would be futile, Admiral. The probe would neutralize us easily.
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
Earth... But when?... Spock?
As you observed, a primitive Culture.
Your use of language has altered since our arrival. It is currently laced with -- shall I say -- more colorful metaphors: "Double dumb ass on you" -- and so forth...
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Mr. Sulu, take the con. I'm taking our guest down to see her whales.  Mr. Spock: have you accounted for the variable mass of whales and water in your time re-entry program?
Guidance is functional. Onboard Computer will interface with Federation memory bank...
Estimating Planet Earth one point six hours present speed.
Hang on, sir... Nine point seven... point eight... Breakaway threshold...
10 seconds, sir!
Whales, Scotty. 45 to 50 feet long; about 40 tons a piece.
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
Oh, here and there.  I flew something similar in my Academy days.
They are my friends.
Yes, of course... Do you have any message for your mother?
Ah, sorenara mazu mazu nagaiki wo sareru to mira.  Ah... Then I am sure that you will have a long and happy life.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
In defense of offlanders, there are many more like me...
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
A perfect moment?
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
I understand.
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
... I am the personification of everything they have rejected.
A ship,
Your Federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be...
I do not take orders from you.
Understood.
I'm acting on orders form the Federation Council.
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
What you're asking me to do... is impossible... the crew is loyal to Ru'afo...
They're following the kelbonite deposits... using the interference to block our transporters...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn't anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes. When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells around my optic nerves...
... had regenerated.
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
If it works you mean.
There's a short letter I left you all, just some... sentimental nonsense... the computer will bring it to your attention at oh- four-hundred... I'd just as soon you delete it...
No, we're here to... rescue them.
You've not aged a day since then?
Worf to Picard...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him out...
Scanners are off line!
... I'm not sleeping well...
All hands. Battle stations!
Go where? Hello? Is anyone going to tell me what we're doing here?
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
I'm saying they might shoot us on sight. You have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
Not yet.
I do not know what you are referring to.
Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
My creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
Yes...
Isn't it better like this...?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
We are approaching the Terran System, Captain.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
What year is it?
I am the Borg.
That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals.
Juice?
Where?
How serious is the damage?
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
Active.
Where in the States?
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
Were the two of you... involved?
Some.
Track their weapons fire.
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
Incoming transmission from Starfleet Command. Admiral Hayes.
Good luck, sir.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
Are we in any danger of being detected by Earth defense systems?
I believe the operation is over.
Thanks...
Are we playing multiple choice?
No more neutral zone. I was USED to hating Klingons... that's why I failed in our assignment.  It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word. Spock was right.
Damned clever if you ask me...
Doctor McCoy, what is your current medical status?
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
What?
I checked the data banks, yes.
Spoken by you?
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
I am.
Torpedo room--?
But if she's cloaked...
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
He's got it.
How much time's left of your sentence?
I can't make it alone. You're the likeliest candidate to come to this god-forsaken place in months.
I was asked by my father to open neg-
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here -
They're dying.
Spock, I'm really tired...
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Close enough to beam down?
Gorkon's own man??
Not as yet, sir.
A lie?
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
NO WAY!
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
They're outside the beaming shield. Mr. Scott, start your engines.
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
I do not understand.
No. I must deactivate you.
But we do have one advantage.  He needs your blood to live. He might come after you first.
That was another time.
I understand why it would seem confusing. Certain human rituals... like weddings, birthdays or funerals evoke strong and very complex emotions. These rites carry great weight with us because they denote the passage of time.
And this makes you "sad"?
Do you think this is a wise course of action?
Of you?
It appears to be...  ... an arm.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
No.
Set up a security program to detect any unusual data stream rerouting. If it happens again, we want to be ready.
Geordi... prepare the shuttle- bay for arrivals. They don't know our procedures so just... open the doors.
So, human... you've met your better self!
That will never happen.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Report.
Unless we can disable his cloak we're just going to be firing in the dark.
I promise you in time, she'll become your home ...If I could offer you one piece of advice?
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Yes.
How did you end up on Remus?
Of course you do. If you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people... you’d be sitting where I am now. At least I hope you would.
What are you doing?
We are.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
How long until we reach the Rift?
How many Warbirds will you need?
I have a purpose.
I'll have to run your card off now.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Where did you stop last?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
It's taken on a disguise.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
No deal.
George... Do you hear me, George?
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
Minneapolis.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
Gas good?
Go.
Who?
I am husband?
I want to try it.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
I will see it next time.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
What happened?
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I understand.
It's bad.
Put that back.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
You promised.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Horses.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
I know how to gamble now.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Yes.
I understand.
I love you.
You sure this is your car?
Slow down, slow down.
Bullshit!
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Oh, Jesus.
Superconducting QUantum Interference Device.  SQUID.  Got it?  There's gonna be a test.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
The only time a whore should open her mouth is when she's giving head.
It's Tran, isn't it?  This guy is poison, Faith.  Listen to me.  He's got you walled in on all sides.  And he uses the wire too much, he gets off on tape, not on you.
Who did it?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
You think Tran killed her?
Sounds good.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Let's work it.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Was I a really busy guy?  Did I do Tick too?
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
Well, it's cutting awful close to me.  I mean she was just here.
You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays?
Way I look at it, I actually perform a humanitarian service.  I save lives.
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
What I'm saying.  But you still come out this goofball romantic.
What's that?  Present from Faith?
No more, Lenny.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
How's Zander?
Will you relax.  There's nobody back there.
Mace, the guy had a knife.  To my throat.  In my living room. Relaxing might be right out, okay?!
Bullet resistant?  Whatever happened to bullet proof?
I've got a good idea, yeah.
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Just Lenny.
Right.  That explains it.
Cheerios and wieners.  I made it myself.  It's good.
Welcome back, sir. How was the vacation?
Anybody talk to the press?
Where's the Nuevo American Diner?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Hey, Sheriff.
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Sheriff Dylan, this is FBI Agent Thomas Mackelway. Remember me?
She's buried.
The family has gone through a lot. Their daughter missing, the search, her body found, the funeral -- then this order to exhume the corpse.
Excuse me?
He was sitting here?
He said it was a clue?
Maybe something to do with Zorro.
We didn't know Speck was a serial, the police didn't know, his wife didn't know -- so how did the killer know?
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
How do you feel, Agent
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
I was visiting an old college friend.
I'm told you've asked for a Bureau cross-check of flight records to and from El Paso, Ft. Myers, Omaha, the Murman murder time frames.
There was talk of a file photo.
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
Miss me, Dave?
Maybe I shouldn't put it that way. I'm on my best behavior. I've got to watch what I say.
You work with Koessler?
Doesn't fit.
That information's being withheld from the media.
Some kids found you in a garbage dump.
He thinks he looks young.
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
There are Agency regulations about this.
That's a crackpot theory. Everybody says so.
You're putting me in a difficult position.
Yeah, of course.
It's quite advanced.
I...
It's a truck. A refrigerated truck.
Kulok.
Uncuff me. What's wrong with you? Don't you want to save the boy?
How did you know Speck was a killer?
Was it Zero?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Locate a jet, we're going to Amarillo.
Okay. I'll think about that. Bye.
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I'd say about two weeks.
Like the quiche?
It does.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Oh. You know.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
No... no... The worst was when I went in for this After-School special and I'm sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. I see they're all signed in for the same role as me...
They were auditioning for the same role as you?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
On the table.
It's a rebound.
Can I check my messages? I have a calling card.
You're a comedian?
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?
You tested over a month ago. I'm sure they figured it out by now.
You want to hit the town tonight?
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
I just tested for one...
What's that guy's name? Sue?
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
You want to talk about it?
What's the point?
You miss the pain?
What are they doing here?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.
S'up Trent?
I don't know...
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
When?
I took out three hundred, but I'm only gonna bet with one. I figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they'll comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. You gotta be cool though.
Vegas! You think we'll get there by midnight?
Pirates of the fucking Caribbean.
Cut that shit out.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Let's just leave.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
I know she's coming back.
I don't think so.
She likes you.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
Baby, you did fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
How?
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
What time's this party tonight?
How you guys doing?
What?
I'm sorry.
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
Please, don't mess with me right now...
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
They're a finesse team...
I don't know. I guess kids were hitting each other or something.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
...shivering...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...Shut up, Sue...
The bear's got his claws back.
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
What do you want of me?  I'll give you anything you want, but do what I ask!
But your daughter is still alive.
You take care of Paulie?
The gun will be there.
How bad will it be?
Why do you come to me?  Why do I deserve your generosity?
I need two million dollars in cash...more important, I need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences.  Be my friend.
You take care of your family?
They'll cut the cake in a few minutes...leave right after that. Your new son-in-law, do we give him something important?
For killing a man.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?
No.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly.  You know the old man doesn't want that.
We should hear what they have to say.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.
Yes.  Tell me.
Then the legs at the knees...
Sure.
For dinner.  Unless I call and tell them we're still in New Hampshire.
No.
I have to see my father and his people when we get back to the Mall.
Don't you want dinner first?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Until the old man tells me different.
We can't wait.  No matter what Sollozzo say about a deal, he's figuring out how to kill Pop.  You have to get Sollozzo now.
O.K.  How long do you think before I can come back?
Most important...I want a sure guarantee that no more attempts will be made on my father's life.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
The chef cooked for you special; the dancers will kick your tongue out and you credit is good!  Draw chips for all these people so they can play on the house.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
Do you recognize my voice?
Is that good?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
You'd say if you mind?
I don't like you.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
I'm intruding.
I'm never going back!
You like jazz!
I love jazz.
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
I played piano in a few places.
I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
I know. I write like a child.
I didn't mean with you in it.
It's just there's so much to do in a single day.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
You can't blame him. You could hardly expect this to go on forever.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example.
So tell me.
No, no, it's not a threat, I've explained all of that.
Hello?
How did you find him? It's such an out of the way apartment. Can I fix you a drink?
I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself. Otello's is on delle Croce, just off the Corso.
Far cry from New York.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Where's Mr MacCarron?
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
He hates being confronted.
Marge, when did you get here?
Very.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
I hope so.
This is spectacular.
That's why Tom wanted you to stay. It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels.
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Emily.  Just kidding.
What?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali?
Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
I've been backpacking.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
What do you want to change about this moment?
How was it?
Why lie?
What do you mean lied about who you are?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Peter, I... I...
You're such a liar...
So Signor Miles drove away and you did what?
Yes, if it's going to help, certainly.
Even your fiancée...?
Thank you.
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
Why?
I don't know...
That's really something.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What are you doing?
You mean you don't want to go to a movie?  There's plenty of movies around here.
Huh?
But... Betsy...
More people watch it.
Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This I gotta see.
Is he Italian?
Betsy, come over here a moment.
What is it? I'm busy.
First she did her make-up. You know, I hate it when they do that. I mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it,
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
A girl needs protection.
That ain't much of a name.
Don't you want to go?
I can leave anytime I want.
Well, you want to or not?
He looks like a killer.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
He shoots dope too.
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
What do you mean?
Why should it be grounded?
Have you tried the telephone?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
I can't sleep nights.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Your name Sport?
Shit.
Hey, Sport. How are things?
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Don't stop...  do no stop.
What, vou?
What are you doing?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Womack ripped it up, right?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
I believe you.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
You look... different.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
And why not?
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Well, there's got to be a way...
Delly, shhhhhh...
Luke Trumbo?  We never met.  But I'd like to think I know him.
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around.  I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him.  That's all.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead.  I also see that you were posted stateside during the war.  Fort Dix?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
I'm not refuting anything.
Yes.  A prepared statement.
Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office?
Tomorrow afternoon...  ... oh my god...
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Thanks.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
Nine and-a-half years ago.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
But I...
Jesus...
Did I what?
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Any idea how you got here, son?
And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
Aren't you coming?
You smell gas?
Exactly.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Not at all.
What?
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
What happened?
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
You hungry, son?
I already have.
Yes?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
San Francisco.
I suspected as much.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
That's up to you.
Is anyone there?
Oh, I suppose so.
See them two big trees across there?
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Why not, Mrs. Bundy?
You cut yourself outside, Miss?
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Lovebirds, I see.
Yes.
I told you. We met yesterday.
In a bird shop.
Yes?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Maybe we ought to leave.
When?
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Yes.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
He's not home.
Well, where did he go?
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
But how... how do you know my name?
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
I think you're a louse.
I am.  Good day.  Madam. 
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
I'm sure.
Why did he shoot her?
He was watching a ball game on television.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Oh. That. Rome.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Yes, I was lying.
I'd still like to see you.
I have several jobs.
What'll it say?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Growing a beard...
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Take wing!
Do you want to try your father again? 
Inland.
What time is it?
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
The gulls were after your fish, Mr. Sholes. Really, let's be logical about this.
No. I don't, Mitch. Because I can't see any reason for it.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
Not if they're starting a war.
Then let's go. Now!
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
You have his promise, then?
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
I'm afraid I'll have to give up medicine, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're too good a man, Fettes -- I'll not let you quit.  I'll make an assistant of you -- that'll pay your keep and your tuition, too --
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
When she's ready you bring her to me -- I'll show her how.
Fettes, the more things are wrong, the more we must act as if everything were right. You must do with Joseph as you did with, the street singer -- complete dissection -- a proper entry in the book --
I want it --
I thought this was a school day.
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
You know something about the human body, Gray.
I set those blocks together, patched the muscles. I put the nerves where they should be -- I did it and I did it right -- and she won't walk --
What are you talking about? I am an anatomist. I know the body. I know how it works.
Like Knox taught you? Like I taught you? In cellars and graveyards? Did Knox teach you what makes the blood flow?
I am a doctor - a good doctor. I could make her walk, but she won't - she won't --
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
This is a gift you'll not return.
But why, Gray? Why?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Only Brother.
"The ruffian dogs, the Hellish pair.  The villain Burke, the meager Hare --"
But where did they get those people?
"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
I don't know you, man.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
You killed that cop Dutton.
My dad was right! He said you'd ruin her life.
In the woods you said you had nothing. But you wouldn't, and I wouldn't if there's some way you don't have to go. Please. At least not right away.
She's... sick.  Actually she never had Mai Tais before.
What were you yelling about?
Are you ok?
Stay away from me! Stay away!
About you.
Thanks -- I'm enjoying it right here.
I talked to most of them this morning... They were all very curious about the meeting.
How can you be so sure? Have you tested this theory?
I find it works well enough to get me from one planet to another.  I understand you've called a meeting to study our space ship.
You have faith, Professor Barnhardt
That was my first question.
It is not enough to have men of science. We scientists are too easily ignored -- or misunderstood. We must get important men from every field. Educators -- philosophers -- church leaders -- men of vision and imagination -- the finest minds in the world.
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Yeah, sure. Mom, do I have to go to school tomorrow?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Gee -- I don't know... The space man, I guess.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.
Well -- atomic power, I would imagine.
No -- I'm afraid not.
I'll tell you, Bobby -- I've been away for a long time. Very far away.
We certainly did.
Just Klaatu.
I'm sure I don't have to point out that your arrival was something of a surprise.  Had you been traveling long?
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
I mean the reasons for my coming here.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
My mission here is not to solve your petty squabbles. It concerns the existence of every last creature who lives on Earth.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
I was.
Is it worth anything?
Just passing through Santa Carla?
How do you like Santa Carla?
Why not?
Well... we blew Plan A.
Time to activate Plan B.
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Where is she?!
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
I wish they were vampires so I could nuke them in their hearts.
I told Max eight o'clock.
... And stay outta here.
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
Been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  Bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  Well, one more day won't hurt. Wanna go into town with me?
Are we havin' fun or what?
No.  Just you.
You like Michael.
Help me, Mom.  Help.
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
These are my dinner guests. Edgar and Alan.  The Frog Brothers.
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
You're cute, Max.
Is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
Max!  What's wrong?
He doesn't walk all over me.
Star.
Me, too.
I used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
You've got to put this on.
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
All right... Box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
Where these tracks headed?
Well, where was he?  Where did he go?
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
... Can't you see...?  If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth. Nothing could stop it!  Nothing!
Watch Clark.
Could have been anytime.  Anywhere.
Let's open it.
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
Yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  He gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. And they get into one hell of a brawl...
What we going to do?!
Torch them!!
Oh, shit!  Well, hang on!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Then I'll have to kill you.
Hey, Sweden!!!
I don't see how... when I'm finished I return it right away.
Let's just not get worried about anything just now.
You reach anybody yet?
Don't let up, Childs!
What about Childs?
Got Sanchez... World War Three wouldn't mess with this fucker... Can go through walls... And it's like all over the place...
Maybe it ain't coming.
No...
Yes.  Just about here.
I can smell carcinogens and industrial pollutants on your skin that have not been known here for --  -- 800,000 years perhaps.  Don't keep me in suspense.  What year?
Do you know where they live?
Excuse me?
So, Relic, you want to open Pandora's box, do you?  See all the mysteries exposed?
Vox --
What's your name?
No, we created the Morlocks.
Created?
But this is barbaric!  Have you completely lost all sense of --
So you take their best...
Now that's what I call plain crazy -- internal combustion is just too dangerous, all those little explosions, never catch on.
How do you keep the water temperature stable?
Alex...?!
Why do we have to race for heaven's sake?!
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
Hiding?
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I live with it every minute of every day.
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
You wouldn't believe me.
I would.
This... was my home.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
I hope it's a happy journey for you both -- and much as I hate to do this, moved as I am by your protestations of love, I'll be needing your money now.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
You can see so many here.
Yes!
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
Is it?
Good -- it looks fine.  We had quite a ride together...
Alexander, take my son away.  Take him back to your time.  Will you do that?
Mara --
Yes, sir, he --
Dr. Philby, Dr. Hartdegen.  I received the most extraordinary letter last week.  From a parent. We are always pleased to receive letters from parents.  They are our employers, after all.  This gentleman's son is in your class, Dr. Hartdegen.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
Imagine that.
And roosters.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
My father has gone to a better place.
We choose to believe it.
Sir, if I may --
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.
Should we be...
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
My business?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
My father used to talk about you.
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Me, too.
They're not here.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
How?
I guess I'd ask you why.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Why don't you help me?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.
Who told you this?
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
It's gonna be sticky.
[Beat] Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm sorry.
Hon.
Yes, baby?
What?
How do you know I took it?  How do you know they didn't just give it to me?
Could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
Hal, I've told you about twenty times, yes, I could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
If waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and I could've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
Armed robber.
So how come you don't have any kids?
No, I mean how would you do it?  Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Yes.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
Okay.  I will, too.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Exactly.
Louise.  Where are we going?
Yes.
We have to think this through.  We have to be smart.  Now is not the time to panic.  If we panic now, we're done for.  Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us.  We're still okay.  Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Why are you actin' like this?
You talked to him?!  Is he mad?  Did you tell him?
Will I be?
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
What happened to your hair?
Taking a shower.
Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit! Shit!
You think you've found your calling?
Thelma.
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You think so?
Besides, what do we say about the robbery?  No excuse for that.  No such thing as justifiable robbery.
What little dogs?
Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.
Nothing.  It's not funny.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I am really sorry about this.
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please?  You wanna put your hands on your head, please?  Louise, shoot the radio.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What?!
What in the hell is that up there?
God!  It looks like the Army!
Hi there!  You alright?
No harm, no foul?
I'm asking you to leave.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving...
He implied it.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Nah.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
Well... at least now you know.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
'That right?
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Am I?
So where the hell are you, Healy?
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Don't you want to know my name?
How'd you know that?
I beg your pardon?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
Lint?
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She's blackmailing you, right?
You can't be serious.
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
Oh my.
Miami?
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Hey, hey, hey!
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
You what?
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
Four.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
Oh... Sully.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
How do you guarantee that?
I can live with those reflections.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
What's a mook?
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Magda!
You don't think they're too big?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?
He's dead.
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Now by killer, you mean...?
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
Please leave.
OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!
Shhhhhh!
Okay.  So is that a yes or a no?
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
...I know. CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs.
What does the letter say?
Helen just asked me what sort of arrangements we have for the families.
What did you think of Lippman's column this morning?
Christ, Ken, you know it's not that easy.
Max.
An invasion...
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
It's Tuesday. You said to call. When do I get my 45 minutes?
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
I don't like what's happening.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
My specialists are in agreement: this morning's letter is not Khruschev. Last night's letter was.  The evidence supports only one conclusion: there has been a coup, and Khruschev was replaced overnight.
Hey.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
You think I killed him? Cuz he was an apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man --
Ray, there's been a homicide out in an area known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.
Nice piece. You come back here to cover your tracks, Geronimo? What's your name?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.
Jesus...
White eagle feather through the circle. That's their symbol.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Jesus, you alright?
This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national security. You don't question that, you don't go digging into that shit -- that's insubordination. Jesus Christ --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
What are you --
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
It's not real.
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
What are you talking about?
Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign from the old ones.
Hoka Hey. It's a good day to die.
X21. Come back.
Washington sent ya. I know that.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
I'll bet!
Yeah, most likely.
I thought he'd never leave.
Yes, ma'am.
For what?
Um. You.
Yes. I'll give you that!
I can't.
Anything.
It dies. We live.
You're horrible
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
You're totally insane.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
That's what you get flight pay for.
That's what I want.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
That's three.
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I was, later.
Remember one thing.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
That's missile lock!
Saving them some paperwork.
Is it you?
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Let me do the talking.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
So's my Johnson.
Tom Kazansky.
I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
How was it?
I've lost him -- where is he?
Great move. Great
Time to go.
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
Until last night. Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party?
GET LOST!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
You saved our lives. You did it!
You like to work alone. I've heard that about you.
Three guesses.
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
You didn't help.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
No bother.
I never heard that.
Freaks?...'Fraid so, man.  Goes with the territory.
What happened to number five?
He's lying.  Hauser turned against you.
Don't take my word for it, Quaid. Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
Perfect!...Get out of Sector G.  Now. Don't think.  Do it.
I'm afraid that's not possible.
What do you want?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
She's real.  I dreamed about her before I even went to Rekall.
Any news of Quaid?
What, aliens?
Yeah.
I did?
What the fuck did I do wrong?!  Tell me!
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
That a problem?
How real does it seem?
What about the guy you lobotomized...Did he get a refund?
...What?
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
I didn't lose it.  Cohaagen stole it. He found out that Hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  Me.
This is too weird.
Why would I lie to you?
I'm not falling for it.
I thought you didn't like me.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
He's lying.
The reactor.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
What?
...Who are you?
Ready as we'll ever be.
You stupid punk!  You came <u>that</u> close, <u>that</u> close!!
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Uh oh, it's Nancy.  She wants another load of firewood.
She's got us.  Now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in Perfection.
Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  Come on, sombody must've chased him up there.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Burt!  Heather!
I'm dead.  Let's finish in the morning.
What?
Hey Val, listen.  Bearing going out, you think?
Yeah, geography.
Around here?  Why would they?
You okay?
Our own Colombian Connection... For three years... Three years of ball breaking detective work. And we put a lotta bad guys behind bars.
That-a-boy. Hospital.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Well then, does the defense have any witnesses?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Not the whole time, of course. I --
Not at all --
Right. You're right.
I specialize, Roger...
-- a speed manufacturer --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
We're taking the other case.
Easy? No... We have to find some piece of evidence that got buried, to reopen the sucker.
That DD-5.
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
You're the police expert in Chinatown gangs?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
I don't know. The truth, maybe.
You can't. So tell me what you do know -- say it!
Are you willing to testify that the man you saw shoot Jimmy Chin was not the man the cops arrested?
I'd l-like to answer the question.
Yes, but that's not the issue. What's on your wish list, Ed? Pleading Kim out to first degree man on both homicides, with an agreed sentence of 15 to life running concurrent? Come on... What're you looking for here?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I don't think I know that name.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
Mr. Ortega, you've known the defendant at Ossining Correctional for how long?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
...A soldado, he takes care of it.
Telephone.  I suppose you don't know the phone company killed Kennedy because he was trying to b-break it up -- and they'll never let that happen. They control everything: what you say in the mouthpiece is never exactly what comes out the other end, and --
Let's test it for the record. Will the next victim be a man or a woman?
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer  ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer...  After that I never saw him again.
Mrs. Simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. Teresa rented it about a month ago.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Ever see her with someone else?
What happened to her?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
She lived alone.
Faulty wiring.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
The usual, 9:15.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
If I can smoke it.
Goodbye, Muffin.
What are you doing?
But I love you, Laura.
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
I did? I didn't see anything.
Who would do that?
The pages are gone. That's real.
What does Bob say?
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
You're on somethin' again, aren't you?
This afternoon?
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I can't tonight.
What is wrong with us?... We have everything.
You always hurt the ones you love.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
Hiking?
Eating?
Can I take the car?
Laura.
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Ben asked him to stay late to plan for the Norwegians.
Good night, Mom.
Who was that?
Dad?
Did you come home during the day last week?
Leland...
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
As if I didn't know.
I'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
You're right. There's no one here.
Come back as soon as you can.
I'm fine.
Four cases in three years...
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
That's the call that I'm waiting for.
What does it mean?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
That's not my handwriting.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
...of Anesthesiology?
...to get her heartbeat back...?
Objection!
Nothing further, your Honor.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Anything special about the case?
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
Yes!
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
Hold on a second.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
I appreciate -- a man as busy as --
The Archdiocese called, they want to settle... her estate...
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
Who told you that?
Yes.
What did she say?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
I changed my life today. What did you do?
Oh, actually it was. Then why'd you call it off?
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
That's not the question. It's over.  Do you think that it's my fault? If I'd... if I'd... I never should have taken it. There was no way that I was going to win.
I...
Business hours are over, Sir. This is the switch...
Pardon?
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
He saw her at the Northern Care...
I want to buy you a drink.
...I have to stand up for her...
What happened, Joey...?
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...of the procedures...
Huh. And why is that?
Franky can't make it. He had an appointment he forgot, he's going to see you later. I'm Mickey Morrissey, we're supposed to get to know each other.
Yeah.  No sense stayin' out here.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Mister Secretary - if they link up with those others near Fresno...
You look kinda lost yourself.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
Did it do you any good?
What's he like?
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Nothing there now.
They've blocked it!
That needle ain't pointing north!
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Gratzman! -- Gratzman!  Did you get those biotics?
We will, sir!
Let's go back inside, Uncle Matthew.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
They'll understand us, all right!
And I...I've got other things happening.
I know.  We asked him to keep it kind of surprise until we talked.  Look, how about we get in touch your agent.  You still with Jerry?
Yes, but...
Maybe.  Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.
He was just here!
No way he's going anywhere.  He's been well sedated.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
Home.
You saw him, didn't you, Dylan!?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Heather?  You doing okay?
Fred Krueger did it.
Heather Langenkamp?
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
Like the Genie in the bottle.
That's not what the dreams say he's doing.
He would have loved this.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
I haven't forgotten.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Everyone aboard young Bill?
Well, that's all part of it.
Skipper called us out of the rigging.
How old are you, son?
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
What the "Bowsprit Affair"?
Yeah.
Bregitta.  Do you believe it?
I couldn't have done it without you.
What?
I've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  It's what they expect. After all this, I still haven't figured it out.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
I'm just not like you.  Ya know? I'm never going to go to Yale.  I'm never going to be "William".
What's the difference?
You only hurt yourself you know?
Can we talk?
Listen man, I think I have a problem.
But that's not the point...
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
Forget it.
Stow away?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
I can take care of myself.
Immortality.
They think we're carrying Cuban refugees.  Skipper, they mean to board us.
That's enough.
Me, too.
The rust won't wait for you to read Conrad, Goodall.
If he's a Cuban, Castro wears a dress.
You've gotta be kidding?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
No.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
Soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
What's that supposed to mean?!
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Why? He's right in the groove.
Yessir.
Get out.
Need a hand?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
No... I don't think so, man.
Nice of you to drop by.
You heard from Reggie?
Used to.
What'd you say?
Gas?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
No sir...
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.
Oh, many things...
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
But I'm wild at heart.
In what capacity?
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
I forgot to show you this. The gentlemen that gave this to me said you'd recognize it. Said he wanted it'd be 'bout the last thing you ever saw in this life.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
I'm scared, mama.
Why, honey?
Case daddy don't like me. What if he don't like that I don't got his color hair.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
What happened to him?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
...are followin' him around.
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Huh?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
You certain?
I do.
What was this one?
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Yeah.
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
They have, sugar.
There's worse places, honey.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
You talk to 'im some?...
So where'd you say you was?
Uh-huh?
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
Perhaps we should call a local law enforcement officer.
Yes.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
In the head.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
Someone's gonna see us.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
Well?...
I'll tell you the problem. You behind the wheel. There's your fucking problem.
She's a transvestite.
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
He has a book.
Come on. Crabs. Don't do this. He's one of my students, for Christ sake. I'm not even sure if he's --
Kidnapped? By who?
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
It's a little late to call Admissions.
What's to tell?
Crabtree.
I want to publish this. I've got to. I think they'll let me. With a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
The hood jumper?
He was never able to reproduce them.
Came to my senses.
No. But I don't think that matters.
No...
You must be mistaken.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
The last month maybe.
Not true. You're the only Vernon I know. Actually, I'm wrong. I once knew a Vernon Peabody at Penguin U.K.
Sara? Hi. It's Grady.
What? No. There's no one here. I'm just... just...
Goodbye, Grady.
It's very convincing.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
That's really it.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
No! He was crazy. I didn't -- he looked -- I thought --
I don't know. I'm still trying to figure out how to tell the Chancellor I murdered her husband's dog.
Oh.
Yes.
Washed up?
How's that?
So where have you been staying?
It's not so bad. I know the night janitor. And there's a broken locker I can put my stuff.
Don't be proud, James. We're in Sewickley Heights. We could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
Glaucoma?
Colon cancer.
Carvel.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
What?
You're mad because I shot your girlfriend's dog.
Jealous? Of me?
Let me spell it out for you, James. Books don't mean anything. Not to anybody. Not anymore.
Yes, James.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
I got the message you called.
New?
She's left before...
Is that Cristaile?
Hm.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
Well...
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
I'm kidding. Hello?
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
Someone stole my car.
I'm so glad to see you, Sara.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
No.
Huh? Oh, someone pulled a B&E on Dr. Gaskell's closet. And the dog's missing.
Foreman now.
I'll never forget you got me started there.
Annette? She's good... tense.
Cherry.
Fucking Mariners.
Fucking Tigers. They got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of Double A or Southern Cal.  How was the party?
What party?
Aren't you glad?
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
You don't have to tell me this.
What are you looking at?
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
Their sound is quite musical.
I can't.
Don't you have friends?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
Woodsman?
Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
A man was badly beaten across the street. You know anything about that?
What's with the boxes?
The passionate one?
So. How are you adjusting?
Are you taking your medication?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
What will happen if I do?
The job's okay.
You seem a little hostile today.
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
Ev-i-dence.
That's right.
You think reflection is good.
Try it.
It's okay.
Maybe it's the way I look. Or the sound of my name.
I don't feel anything.
Fuck you, Rosen!
What did you think would happen?
I don't know.
You know that if anything happens, I spend the rest of my life in prison. No parole, no nothing.
I want to talk about it now.
When did it all start?
You mean my problem?
Why?
Where are you?
What the hell are you doing there?
Nothing.
What else?
That's all. I just liked smelling her hair.
It was a small house.
Time.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
I'll buy a plant.
Is that a school?
I like the noise.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
They could eat you.
What?
Why do you want to know?
So, you're not a dyke.
No you're not.
Did I say something wrong?
What did you do to them?
Get your kicks somewhere else.
I've changed.
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
Which brother did this?
Just think about it.
Do you want to talk about it?
Right through the brainpan.  Deader'n dogshit, boss.
It was alright for a while, you know.  But then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
I can't believe you let them do this!
Wasn't up to me.
You never did like being called that, did you?
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
Did you get anything on the cameras.  Video or anything?
What do you think he saw?
Need some help?
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
You owe me one, Virgil.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
How?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
Is that it?  Is this right?
Hey, you guys are milking that job.
You better not say you missed that.
SHIT!
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Cab Three, check.  Right behind you.
Hey!
When do you have to go back?
So, it will just take you a little longer to get over it.
Yes, fairly well. But I went to bed last night planning to do some thinking about a number of things ... instead, I fell asleep.
This one is gorgeous.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
That must be Basiluzzo.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
Have you decided?
Somebody must live here!
I have a feeling that you're not used to being alone.
Oh, Sandro...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
That's why I asked you...
No, Sandro... Please...
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Good night, my love.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
I'm not coming.
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Don't you ever paint men?
What other boat?
We have a radio like this, too.
Another thing; there's an old man who lives here on the island...
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
Zuria?
One of the other Sisters?
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
He loves you the way you are.
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
Agnes...
Who tells you these things?
You've got to eat something Agnes.
I don't know.
Yes Mother.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
Yes, Mother.
Let's talk about something else.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, yes!
How were you sick?
Where'd it come from before that?
Anything?
Would you like to be?
Where do you think babies come from?
What else did she tell you?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Where did you go?
Do you?
Is that what she said?
But you're troubled... aren't you?
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
She...
That you're a mistake?
I'm afraid.
Agnes, you're stupid.
And why am I here?
It came out of me.
Yes.
Someone's following me.
Sister Marguerite I think.
Are you frightened?
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop.  Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
God!  It was God.  And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
She took the baby in her arms?
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
You know Martha never comes to see me. You watch it, she's going straight to hell... after all the things she said to me. Then she marries that son of a bitch of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I knew that one wouldn't work out. Not like you Marie. You got married to God.
Yes.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Oh, we just wonder if you can be very objective about this case.
I can beat that.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
Yes.
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Well... what do you think?  Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
So, someone else could have done it.
Who?
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
I'm only interested...
???   ... virginity, right Mother?  Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Then help her.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Oh, some time in January.
When was that?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Right...
But how did it happen?
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
I don't know... too late to stop it.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
No!
Lay them down.
They are?
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
I'm a deserter.
No, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
How about Ding Dong?
Shurrup!
I don't snore.
Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Sure. .
It's Paul's grandfather.
Is it ... is it, really?
Gear?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
Aye, I knew you were.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
Is she?
Ah.
Books are good!
Parading?
When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
What are they saying?
Well, you got me here so do your worst but I'll take one of you with me.  Oh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I'll defy you still.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Anything to spare?
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
Paul, John, George - get at it.
You wouldn't!
Control yourself or you'll spurt. He's bound to be somewhere.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Oh yes.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
What have you heard?
You're a window rattler, son.
He's betrayed the class.
Your Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
Don't exaggerate.
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Stop picking on him.
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
What is he?
Are you in pain?
Is it solid?
Maybe we can get in by the top.
Dell, you want to come down, we can figure out where to go from here.
Are you okay in there?
Wretched.  What happened to me?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
<u>He</u> died.
Why, what's wrong?
Dead.
What the hell's going on?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
So it's trapped in between -- now we have to drive it out.
I never saw anything like that in my life... except molecular acid.
Now we're in for it.
Yes.
We've got six hours left.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.
What?  What was that?
I'm getting nowhere.  The whole area around the pyramid is dead to transmission.  I think we should go after them.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
What's happening up here?
Is it armed?
This looks ancient.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
Here's his line.  We can haul him out of there if we have to.
No, thank God... just missed him.
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Are they close?
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Oh my God.
Any microorganisms?
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Oh well... you know me.
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
These will be very useful.  At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands.  All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.  Whoever finds it first, catches it in the net and ejects it from the nearest airlock.  Clear?
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Better?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
When?
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
How much air-time have I got?
C'mon, man.  One more sweep.
Goldsmith's gonna be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
Hold it, hold it...
Compensate!
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, we're in business.
Uh-huh.  Used to get it pretty bad.  I'd wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
Agreed.
So, what do you think?
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
What can I do?
You should hit the sack, too.
What time's sundown?
Hello, there. Who are you?
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Of course your performance was no surprise to me. After the other day I regarded it as no more than - a promised fulfilled.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
Yes. I do.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Paved with what, then?
What time?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
- something about an old road ending and a new one starting - paved with stars...
I didn't mean just the Theater.
... and Karen.
What do you take me for?
What have you got to do with it?
What of it?
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Why not?
It is senseless to insist that theatrical folk in New York, Hollywood and London are no different from the good people of Des Moines, Chillicothe and Liverpool. By and large, we are concentrated gatherings of neurotics, egomaniacs, emotional misfits, and precocious children-
She was magnificent.
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
Macbeth.
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
I had no idea you were even here.
She's a girl of so many interests.
The audition.
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano?  Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
I mix what I like.
Here we go...
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I am.
Don't be condescending.
You've had so many reasons for not wanting to marry me... Margo, tell me what's behind all this.
I just wondered.
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Your make-up's a little heavy.
You hear all kinds of things.
You need new girdles.
How do you do, my dear.
She works hard.
You all put together?
What are you doing here?
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Not at all.
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
Oh, but there is-
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
I'm not crying.
He can help you.
I'll never get over it.
I wish I could believe that.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
Addison wants me to play it.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
The curtains. I made them myself.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Why not?
They're your fans, your audience-
Margo, really...
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott...  Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
Coming?
And again and again! Two hours late for the audition, to begin with-
That's on time for Margo.
Of course she knew! For one thing, Addison told her how superbly Eve had read the part-!  Karen, let me tell you about Eve. She's got everything - a born actress. Sensitive, understanding, young, exciting, vibrant-
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
What is?
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
Such as?
Well of all-
- well? What happened?
What's so funny?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Margo, you haven't got any age.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
Hello..
A couple of weeks.
Who am I to threaten? I'm a dying man.
--what have you been here, nine months?--I been in this business since I was sixteen--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
And McCord was carrying an application for college press credentials for the Democratic convention.  The Times has got to be full of it-- it can't be crazy Cubans.
Hey?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
July of '71.
--shit, who do we know?--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
You overslept?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
I didn't.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
Can't help you.
--no--
Oh, they're here.  I'm keeping much better records now, Hannah.  See? 
I think.
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
Hey, easy...
You've really got to go.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
Because people at the Committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
It will, it just hasn't bottomed out yet, give it time.
I don't know titles.
--what do you think?--
We can't talk inside either?
Douglas Caddy, the attorney of record, when questioned about his presence in the courtroom, denied he was in the courtroom, "I'm not here," Mr. Caddy said.
I assure you, there's nothing mysterious involved.
--I met one of the defendants, Mr. Barker, at a social occasion once--  --I have nothing more to say.
Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
Yes, sir.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Government. Recently retired.
Never? Please don't tell me never.  Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
Preliminary hearing at Superior Courthouse?
OK, get on this W.House guy and do a better job then you did on McCord.
I did all right on McCord.
What'd you get on W.House?
Woodward's onto a new wrinkle with the break-in thing--absolute page one stuff--
--well and good, but when will he say it on the record.
--I already get the Post. I don't need another subscription.
Look, Chris.  There are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
I'm so happy for you.  Takes the edge off, doesn't it?  And where might your date be?
...Nevermind.  You have anything to drink?
I believe the kegs are upstairs.
This.  Right now.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Um...Chris --
Come on!  I won't tell.
Alright, cool.  I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
Because I want to.
What?
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
Yeah right.
That's not why we're going out.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
He likes it.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
No you haven't.
You're so big!
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
You can crash at Stifler's?
What about you?  You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Yes dad.
Sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
Yes.
Dad.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Okay.  Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Don't you want me to?
Illegal channels?  Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
Who cares?
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
You've got something going?
You did it.
Strip?
Move with the music.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
And I want to try to make it up to you.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Like how?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Now?!
Yeah.  Are you sure?
Victoria...I love you.
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Have you ever heard of the bible?
What?  Not <u>the</u> Bible?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
You actually said that?!  Haaaah!!
What the fuck are you doing here?
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
Really?
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Didn't even have to ask.
God. I can't believe it.
Okay, what the hell are you up to?
You on drugs? Huh?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM!  Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Oh shit... No...
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Where is it! Please!
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!
Hurry, Grandmama!
Anya! What if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
We're just going to refresh your memory...
Yes, your highness.
I have my reasons.
By pulling my hair?!
Every Russian family has one..
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Trust me, it's her!
It's her.
She doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
You're a princess...
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
I should go
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
And tell me that she's happy.
May I present her Royal Highness Princess Anastasia!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
Hey, you on television?
What's your name?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Yes.
Why not?
Lyndon Johnson?
Tsch.
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Oh!
I-you know, I don't wanna.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
You-you play... very well.
So sorry.
Oh - you're an actress.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Don't be funny.
Okay.
Neat, yeah.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah?
Hey, listen, listen.
What?
Okay.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Yeah?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
Oh, yeah?
I know you've only known me a short while.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know it's small.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
How is it any different?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
Yeah?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
Okay, let me have this.
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
It's for my complexion.
Oh, Jesus, really?
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Here's a real present.
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
You look very pretty.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Six-year-old boys don't have girls on their minds.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
I can't.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Charlie Chaplin.
Hey.
What are you making such a big deal about?  They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
You're crazy!
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Oh.
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy...  I feel dizzy, Max.
Oh, Jesus.
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
So the colored have enough trouble.
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, that Randolph Hunt. You remember Randy Hunt, Annie. He was in the choir with you.
You think so? Do you really?
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
No, no, no, not at all.
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
Oh.
Yeah.
A long time.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?
It has your ring.
Absolutely.  And she's got great tits.
Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you.
I'm in mourning.
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
What?
He's allergic.
Borrow whatever you like.
I'd say it was down.
You should have brought him.
Is he not going?  I booked a flight.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
What is it?
The suspense is killing me.
You need to call your dad.
Cal, my wife Judy.
Hm.  We should do it again.
I don't think so.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
Whatever you say.
Take your time, Jer.
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
I'm going to throw up.
Otis!  No barking!
It's an unfair advantage.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
There are fucking coyotes out there.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
Cal, too?
This is insanity.  Sally...
Don't.
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
Yes.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I know.
Sure.
Don't I find what?
Do I put you off?
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Something soft.
Very well put.
I think he's really angry with me too.
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
I don't need a drug.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
I'm sorry.
Come on in.
The charades.
Thank you.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
You don't know she's a bitch.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
That's it?  Yes.  Fine?
You're my best friend.
Thank you, Panes.
Panes?
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
You don't need to do that.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
Ah.
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
Neither does Joe.
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Are you asking me out to dinner?
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
You're right!
Wait!  When can I see you again?
I'm Princess Bala.
What <u>was</u> that thing?
Worker!  Come back here now!
Want a list?
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take a nap.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
Well...no, but --
So what makes you so special?
Of course not --
Who is that idiot?
Bala!
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Of course.  The entire royal family will be there to honor you.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
But General -- this tunnel is your baby!  You're sure you can't stay ?
Very well, General -- I know you -- all work and no play!
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
You're a real buddy.
You sure this is a good idea? DOBISCH Can't think of a better one.
Sheldrake?
I've been here twice as long as you have --
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Oh, I never catch colds.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
I hope everything goes all right.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Sure.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I think so.
I don't understand --
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right --  -- isn't she, Doc?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
Here. How about some breakfast?
Baxter.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Cut.
Too slow?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Sure.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
There's a call for you --
I don't want to talk to him.
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
That's terrible.
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then.  Cheers.
The dishes?
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
You do?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
I am?
Morning, gentlemen.  Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Well -- I guess so.
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
Yeah.  You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
On account of me.
You?
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Good evening, Baxter.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
No.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
I took sleeping pills.
No.
What for?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know I liked it better long.
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Important?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Are you sure that's what you want?
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
The nerve.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
What gives?
Me? SHELDRAKE Thank you for giving that little pep talk to Miss Kubelik at the office party.
One for all -- all for one --
Part.
Yeah. Way north.
Were you Longe Range Recon --
Yeah.
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
How long were you up there ?
A long time.
So what happened ?
Holy shit.
Who's he?
All right with me, I used to drive a taxi.
Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?
Well, get in there.
When'd you do it?
What cat  ?
Would he remember you ?
You didn't like him.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
Who is he?
This gentleman or myself ?
I believe on your last job you executed a tax collector in Kontum, is that right ?
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
How big it is?
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four -- bring it in on along tree line and huts.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
What'd you do for supplies?
When did you hear?
Who knows.
That village you're pointing at is kinda hairy.
Yeah, I like it...
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
Oh Captain, that is so true.
What?
Are you finished surfing?
Nah.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
What?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Why didn't he shoot you?
No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy.
Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels...
May I ask where the Captain is going in his little boat?
What will you do after the war?
Yes.
Right now -- I am.
Where's your chief supply officer?
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
102  CONTINUED:
117  CONTINUED:  
What makes you so sure my boys won't be waiting for us?
165  CONTINUED:  
Oh.
Why?
Best thing is, Meyerling has to chase around to find us.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Okay by me.  You're the one likes these hot springs so much.
Nice bluff the other day with the tranquilizer gun out your jeep window.  See you again, maybe.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
You know Meyerling?
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
I'm hungry.  Go kill me some dinner.
Don't push me..!
Hullo, Sam.  Slow day?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
All this for laying traps on private land?
-- I'm putting him on the plane to Fairbanks, eleven tomorrow.
What's wrong?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Neff, you know better than this...
Alleged killer.
What does this matter to you?
Damn.  Likely that's an SOS. Have to pass on that lunch.
That's what we should've done in the first place.
Bet I could make some money turning Ben Corbett in.  Maybe more for lettin' him loose.  I was up in my cache.  Saw the Northland man come talk to you.
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
I called the cops in Fairbanks, see when Ben is standing trial. They don't know shit about Ben or Wilder!
Get the fuck out of here.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
What is it you want? What?
How was it talking to him?
I'm sorry.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
Oh, please...
How do you know about my mother?
Carol the waitress?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Is there another way to see it?
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Hi.
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
Okay to say something now?
What job?
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
How to die, mostly.
No, I promise...  not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Absolutely.
No, I didn't.
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Get out.
Not it at all, really.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
You going to come talk to me or not?
Because...  ... you love her?
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out.  Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Absolutely not.
Not too good at small talk, eh?
Hey.  What I don't get was why didn't you take the shot inside the restaurant?  I mean you had me, a free shot.  That's what I would have done.
Tachlinkov.
After those cops, you'll never be able to come back to Cleveland.
What are you doing?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?
Listen to me, Bain.  Two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where I was going to pick up the transferred money from MicroCell. You don't know how they got the information.  It bothered you, but you didn't care.  How do I know this?  Because ten years ago, I was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
I ain't scared of you.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
I'm on the scent.
No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Sick.  The flu.
Send the file.  I'll have the estimate tonight.
Um, five.
Yeah.
You want me to pump?
Nikita?
You're one of them, aren't you?
Yes.
This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
How old were you?
Because you are a women.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Several.
Where is it?
Yes.
Do you think he's here?
Here?
Okay.
Sorry.
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
We split the money?
Except, if he doesn't come out of the hotel.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?
Was that it?
You didn't take it.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
Thank you.
Yes.
Who was she?
Martin.
Electra --
Was nice.
Do you ever regret things you've done?
It's a common question.
Yeah.
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
I don't know. It's kind of underground. Doug's right, there's too much crap in this town.
It's okay, they're training me on the cash register and after I hope to work on one of the jewellery counters.
Son of the American ambassador and a banker - good enough?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
We're only joking.....It is your round though!
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
That stinks!
And put it on expenses?
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
I've been saying that since we met.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yeah, I'm beginning to see that.
Sounds like a good reason to leave it alone.
Need any disks?
So why didn't we?
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
Why don't we go together?
And a tram hit you?
It just happened.
You capitalist pig!
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
That bad?
Your too good for this town, Buddy.
He got that one right.
What happened?
You're kidding.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
WE gotta think of something.
Lucky break!
You mean, Josh's father had nothing to do with it?
No, by road?
I don't know what it is with you bloody hooligans. Not content with causing trouble back home, YOU idiots have to go off and wreak havoc throughout the whole of Europe. And when finally, the police do catch up with you, you expect us to wave a magic wand and get you out, well not this time, I'm sorry.
That's my mum's.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
Hi, want to take up dancing?
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
I got a bad feeling about this.... How much do you need?
Am I invited?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
It's all my fault, I'm so sorry Doug.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
You will wish you hadn't.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
I'm not sure it's possible.
I'll need to make a phone call.
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
Okay, Okay, but I want it right back. It belongs to my father.
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
Just yesterday.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Why are there still such headlines?
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
You know everyone can be controlled Pavel. Where are you storing the personnel files?
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Pictures from the play. Jamie looks pretty --
Kelly wouldn't do that.
Why not?
'Bout what?
It could help with a new car --
You're fine like that, Mom.
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
Now it's okay?
The address?!
And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan.
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
I don't want to have any conversation.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
What the -- ?!
I know. Don't say anything.
Saturn. Beautiful.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
You're really into God, right?
You're not in a very good mood.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
You don't know what you want --
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Is there a rush?
Before we do this.
I might do it wrong.
What are you going to -- ?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
Now? We just --
I've talked to your father.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Does it have to do with Jamie?
This week.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
Where did you get -- ?
This... is the number one single?
How was school today?
Learn anything?
Hi, Marty.
I think I know exactly what you mean.
Dad, you seen the drill?
Learn anything?
It was Marty's turn to be confused. Huh?
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
You'd like to see a nuclear holocaust?
Who, me?
Then where the hell is he?
Pardon me?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
An atomic bomb.
You're talking crazy! An atomic blast would melt me and the time machine in a matter of seconds!
The test is this Monday! 15 megatons... Let's see, we need 4200 rads...  You'd have to be...exactly 800 yards from ground zero... You realize that what we're going to do could be extremely dangerous.
It'll be fine, Marty.  You'll be fine. Good luck. He stuck his hand out and Marty shook it. But there was still a question that was nagging at him...
Okay.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
Oh yeah?
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
You like people?
I mean it.
Okay.
Yeah. I can imagine.
There you go.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
What a nice place.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
I can look and see.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
You tired?
Don't.
Yes.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
Fine.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Maybe.
You didn't walk out here.
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Planet 10?
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Running a little late, Buckaroo.
Let her out. In my custody.
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
You don't wanna know.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
It's too dangerous.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
Could you come back later?  It's just...  too hot... My head is killing me.
...No, I've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. Maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a personal pain. At any rate, I don't believe good work is possible without it.
Think about it, Fink. Writers come and go; we always need Indians.
What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. They've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the Hollywood Bowl.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
What do you think this is? HAMLET? GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big men in tights! You know the drill!
Understand shit! I though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
He's a great writer –
Well he's taken an interest!  That means he'll make your life hell, which I could care less about, but since I drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, I covered for you. Told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. I told him it was great, so now MY ass is on the line.  He wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. I mean important. This may be the most IMPORTANT work I've done.
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
Howdy, neighbor.
What do you mean?
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
Stop with the police! Wake up, friend! This does not look good! They hang people for this!
Yeah, but Charlie –
Sure, Charlie.
You'll be back?
I'm at the Earle.
...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?
Mr. Lipnik.
Actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. Had wardrobe whip this up. You gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. I can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the Japs. Little yellow bastards.  They'd love to see me sit this one out.
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I help you, sir?
L.A.P.D.
Charlie... Charlie's back...
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
He teach you to do it?
Yeah, I was drinking.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
How is your -- personal life?
You should do something about this lock.
I'm De...
About a year and a half.
Were you with him last night?
Was there anyone with you last night?
What's your new book about?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
You like playing games, don't you?
Why not?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
Why not?
You can make a mistake.
What did you pay Nilsen?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Why take the risk?
You're in over your head.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
How'd you get in here?
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
Why not?
Why?
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
She misses me.
What you doin', son?
You think I --
I don't think it's funny.
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
You don't like punk rockers?
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
You knew her, didn't you?
Yes I did.
Hey – it's the big A.M..
When's your show?
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Nixon lives in Saddle River, New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Let's leave this town and go someplace. Some island.
What's wrong?
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Annina Nosei.
How do you know?
I need a dealer.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
Really?
Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
He's the best painter in the world. I'm gonna give him one of these.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
Hi.
What's that about?
See you later.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true.  There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
That one's for you.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
Man, I was up on him years ago on the IRT.
It's cold.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Ah, the direct approach.  I admire that in a man with a mask.  But you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
I, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
... Maybe I'll watch it on TV.
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
Had one.  Didn't work.
And the truth frightened her?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
"Oswald" is linked to the Red Triangle Gang.  I can't prove it but we both know it's true.
Course you're feeling fine ... You almost made a monster the Mayor of Gotham City.
Your blood, Max.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
I'll warm ya!  I got hot mitts --!
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
Well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... A vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
Son!
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
You know what, Mr. ... Penguin-Sir? I think perhaps I could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  And once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
Bu ... wh ... I ... I mean ...
Morning, Max.  Bummer about the store.  You insured?
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
Uncle Alfred?
You have?
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
What seems to be the problem?
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
What are you talking about?
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
You're not even listening to me.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I'm late for the dedication.  Then I go after Freeze and Ivy.  Alone.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
My reserves are exhausted.  I must have the gems that power my suit.
Okay, my hair is brittle, my skin is dry and I don't care.  I'd weather blizzards to have you. You're the most perfect man I've ever known.
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
Tell me and I'll kiss you.
It'll never work.
Do you remember the night I fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
Gee, I'm not sure.  Alfred? How many rooms? Total?
What did you say?
He ran away?
Maybe they're right.
All the answers are numbers.
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
And another name for Mystery?
How come this is the only locked door around this museum? What's back there?
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
What's wrong?
Now black rubber.
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
We'll talk some other -
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Find anything interesting?
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Touchy, touchy.
What are you talking about?
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
What the hell did you think you were doing?
How could I forget?
I really do apologize, Mr. Wayne. His project was terminated this morning...
I'll show you it works.
...or death.
Wait! You said you'd let me go!
Holy shit.
It's all right, Alfred. Everything's under control.
GET IN THE CAR!!
The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So --
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
How'd you find this place?
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still at large.
Tell me, Knox. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
There's terror everywhere.  If you train yourself to look for it.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself -- I'm extraneous to the process.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
Gimme a break, will you?  Shut up.
Okay, a break-in.  Trash the office, make off with the books ... "Industrial espionage."
I don't like taking orders from Grissom. And I especially don't like taking orders from Grissom's goon.
Please! We'll talk. Just tell us what you expect.
I've seen worse.  Much worse.
I'll see you burn.  I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
You are on drugs.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
Do we know anything about him?
It isn't working any more, David.
Shut up, Kevin.  Honey, you-re not making sense ...
Okay.  It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the gallery ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.
Here, let me do that.
Big day today, huh? 78
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Yes, isn't he.
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
Very pleased you've taken him in, David.  At a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
I owe you a very serious apology, young man.  It wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  I sincerely hope that you do not.
A car sounds sensible.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
Interesting suit.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Huh huh huh. That chick was talking about doing it.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
My butt's bothering me!
That was boring. Huh huh.
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Hey, where'd those chicks go?
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or something... Are we almost there?
Uh... bye-bye.
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Hello there. Are you two heading for Las Vegas?
Oh, there are so many slots you won't know where to begin.
Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
Really? I poop too much.
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
You got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Say chief, isn't that guy whose camper,...I mean, off in whose...
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
You got two seconds!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
Oh, honey, I'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
Jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
I am sitting.
Two hours.
What?
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
We need some help.  I found something this morning.  Here. Emergencies.  'In case of emergency, draw door.'
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!
What...?
Help vouchers?
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
This is <u>my</u> town.
<u>Never trust the living</u>!  We <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
What do you mean?  What's he do?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Yeah.
Minor problem.  The rules.  I can't tell it to you.  But... do you know how to play charades?
God, you're anatomically correct!
W... What is it?
It's <u>Otho</u>!
I can't believe that we're eating Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan up here?  Hunan?
I feel like we've been at war, Charles.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  Build them a dormitory in the woods.  Listen, think right about it, will you? We've almost got the house ready, you bring Sarah with you and I'll show you.
I can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>Ghosts</u>.  I am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  Otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  My agent, Bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>Architectural Digest</u>.  In fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>Vanity Fair</u>.  Except you.
I think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
Viridian?
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in chemistry.  I was a hair analyst! Briefly.  Interior design is a <u>science</u>, Delia!  Think of me as Doctor Otho.  And this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
<u>No</u>!  Do not encourage this little... person.
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
... Straight out?
Thank you.
No, Robert.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I have no idea...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I see.  ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Your leg must be getting better.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
Mr. Gardiner, I'm Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening.'
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I see.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Yes. I am very hungry.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Yes, Ben - he is.
Thank you, Ben.
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
I want to tell Eve.
Mr. Gardiner, my editors and I have been wondering if you'd consider writing a book for us? Something on your political philosophy. What do you say?
Some pictures...?
Good day, Mr. Chance.
Please, sir.
I've never ridden in an automobile.
... Evening, Chance.
Yes, Louise. I have seen it often. It happens to old people.
... How long have you been living here?
Do you have any proof of your employment, Mr. Chance - any checks from the deceased, any contracts or documents?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
1952...?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
... You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
... Nothing.
Sid, it's useless!
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
Quietly, please. Mr. Gardiner, for one, understands our language.
But... Where was this man Gardiner before last week?
Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.
I see. Clearly, such interest on their part is of great political significance.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Gardiner, yes, sir.
Yes, sir - we are aware of all that, but still, we haven't been able to...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
This is not what I requested.
Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent.
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Malkovich.
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
You've always loved the animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
Maxine...
Holy shit, yes!
That... was... no... simulation.
Schwartz.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think.  I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
What?
Just.
What'll you have?
No, wait! I like your tits.  I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
You wanted to be partners with me?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Lotte? Is that you?
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Don, I was wondering, do you know why our workplace has such low ceilings?
You've got to tell Craig what's going on. He must never leave Malkovich.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No. Don't be an ass.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Impressions? Those are hard.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
Fork ah did?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
You were stoned. Case closed. End of story. How hot is this babe?
Do we get to wear a crown?
But of course.
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
Oh, be still my heart.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
When?
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
She's not available.
What's the play?
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Mr. Malkovich?
Thanks so much for coming over.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I'd love to see your work.
No!  But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Bad dream, darling?
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Folks came.
Folks come. Folks go.
Well what?
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
You blaming God. That what you're doing?
Not like He punished me.
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
She gone like they say?
Oh.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Back stiff?
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
True.
He's sleeping in the church.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
It's her, ain't it?
Ella.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
You?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Well I...I did get offered one place but I just wanted to be off by myself a spell.
Just me.
You remember your price, Stamp?
Never found out.
Leave off..
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
What do you think?
Manolo will load it into your car for you, uh, Dude.
Why me, man?
Where'd she been?
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I want Bill Kunstler.
That guy treats women like objects, man.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR MONEY!
NUSSING!
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
What the fuck is he talking about?
What do you mean, Dude?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
What--
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
He peed on the Dude's rug--
They posted the next round of the tournament--
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
They were Nazis, Dude?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
Please!  Please!
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Far out.
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
Different mothers, huh?
No, they--
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
Howdy do, Dude.
I thought you might know, man.
Me?  How would I know?  The only reason she ran off was to get away from her rather sizable debt to me.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Excuse me?
Yeah, but what about--
That's really thoughtful but I--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Well yeah...I know that.
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
Do you still have that doctor's number?
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
It's not my father's money, it's the Foundation's.  Why did he think you had it?  And who does?
Jeffrey--
Increases?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
This was, uh--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Am I wrong!
Walter, you can't do that.  These guys're like me, they're pacificists. Smokey was a conscientious objector.
And you know Smokey has emotional problems!
Okay then.  We play Quintana and O'Brien next week.  They'll be pushovers.
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
The what?
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
That wasn't her toe.
How the fuck should I know?  I do know that nothing about it indicates--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Not if I have anything to say about it.
Who the fuck is that?
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I need you to come pick me up--
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye
Wha.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Look, let me explain something. I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if, you know, you're not into the whole brevity thing--
Huh?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Look at that fucking phony, Dude! Pretending to be a fucking millionaire!
Oh, shit.
Shit, sorry man.
He's half yours, partner.
What?
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
What is it with you people and pain?
Blade.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
It means "bloodbrother."
Put it back in park, Blade.
Thought you were dead.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
And why is that?
Hey, hey!  The fuck you doing?!
They've made contact with the Reapers.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.
Yeah, your little cootchie knew.
She's been bitten.
You're blind --
But I just got here --
-- he's a vampire.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
And that's a good thing?
I know this place -- it's a blood bank.
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.
Isn't this all a little high-tech? I thought vampires were more into cobwebs and coffins.
I made a trip to the hospital last night, borrowed some equipment.
-- tearing me -- apart.
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You don't have to be.
I wish you could see the world as I do. Deacon opened my eyes. There's no turning back from that.
I don't believe that.
This isn't human blood.
Curtis, it's three in the morning. I'm really not in the mood for one of your practical jokes.
It's not a joke. I've got the stiff sitting in the morgue right now -- look, just come up and see him, okay? Five minutes, that's all I ask.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
But you use blood banks --
Blade --
The Thirst overcomes him, just like the others. It's not something he can control.  The problem is, time's running out. His body's starting to reject the serum. And so far, all my efforts to find a cure have ended in failure --
All right, let's start with the basics -- why do vampires need to drink blood?
Their own blood can't sustain hemoglobin.
--stop it! Stop talking about it! I'm gonna freak!
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--I'm not staying here!
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
--it's called "morning sickness," asshole--
"The Voiiiiices made him do it."
Whatzername--the "psychic" Anna hired.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
Why is there no "our" here?
Baby names?
I don't know. Nightmare.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I can't.
--like you hurt the baby--
I know, I know.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
I don't think it was them.
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
--which'd be about ten bucks--
No.
Cotter?
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
--Cotter--
--a Wiccan--
What're you doing?
How're the cameras doing?
Asleep--
Let's get inside.
Running a junk yard.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Pointless.
Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
What're you afraid's going to happen?
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
She <u>wasn't</u> a witch.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
I can't do it!
Check the monitor, she's <u>fine</u>.
Anna--
Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
Your mother's pastor.
Yes.
Thanks, Meurice.
Jesus, I got a hangover. Want a drink?
Where... where you going?
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Hello?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...Where is everything?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
What "what"?
...That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
Yeah. Is it...
...What?
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
What's this?
...I don't want that asshole near my money. I don't even want him in the bar.
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
I sent a trunk home yesterday. This is all I have.
Hey, I brought some friends. and some beer.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
You did? A human ear?
Okay.
What is this? What color is it?
What color is it?
Hey. Tits. I'm taking your neighbor to the country. maybe something for you too.
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Oh he forced you, huh?
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
Next Christmas. Is he Santa Claus who has left a present for Dorothy? What was it? An ear? Another ear?!!  What was it?
You don't?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Yes. Frank-
Are you a bad boy?
You like to open me. don't you?
Yes.
Okay. I know you've been scared. now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
They hurt his head.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
You hungry or thirsty, or both?
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Brilliant.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
You saw a lot in one night.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What was that all about?
It's good to see you.
Look Jeffrey.
uh uh.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
God. you scared me.
Well.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I've been holding this shit for him for three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't appreciate it.  You tell him I want my money by Friday.  Can you do that?
Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From what they say, it is free and it's Diego's new home.
Three-hundred kilos is a very big load, Georgie.  Why don't we start small?
Que va hacer?
Blanca, por favor.
Nothing like this back home.
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Excuse me?
Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or understanding with the United States Government in connection with your testimony in this case?
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Excuse me?
What?
What kind of project?
You like to make the boundaries disappear.  It's not only the money, is it, George?  The adventure is part of the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?
I just got released five minutes ago.
What's the matter, George?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point five.
Of course we are brothers.  Why do you say that?   You hurt me, George.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
Barbara.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
Yeah.  Nice.
I like to come up here.  To make the decisions.  To be one with nature.
Money.
Diego?
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
You mad at me?
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
No.
Why are you smiling?
Jesus Christ.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.
There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha. Be cool, will ya.
Are we gonna split up?
I don't know.  Maybe California.
You know I can't.  Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
You swear?
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Because she's visiting me.
Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
G-d, I'm stoned.  I'm stoned.  I'm really...
So?
Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!
Are we good?
Second district ... Explain better ...
Sure. By shooting at me.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Be careful now. Unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
No, and neither were my men.
Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I think ...
A name?
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
Marsh's Cardiologist told me that after Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking and started exercising every day.  Does that sound like a guy who'd start shoveling cocaine up his nose?
Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces of sperm on the sheets.  The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
We know Marsh had a head cold.   We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.  The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time.  He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Rebecca Lawson.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
It didn't.
Why did she say she was leaving?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
October twenty-seventh.
Yes.
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
What changed?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
Who told you that?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Yes.
P.M.
You see that's what bothers me.  No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house.  The police looked. There was only the one bottle.  But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death.  How do you think it got there?
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Yes.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
That's not an answer.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
She's mistaken.
Why?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Because I'm expecting a call.
But Your Honor--
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
I am relaxing.
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
What's she like?
Why don't you talk to him now?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
It was a place to start.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
I bet mom could've helped her.
Did we want to?
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Well, I didn't know they was a secret club.
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Why did you stop?
No. I'll do them later.
Francesca?
Yes.
What?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
Am I interrupting anything?
I'll pick you up.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Why?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
No one's asking you to!
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
For who?
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
Where you going?
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
Oh my God...!
They're not going to find her!
It clearly states in the will --
Is it true?
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Just some flies.
What the hell you talking about?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
You want us to move in here?
Where's the others?
Clean your mouth, or I will.  Those boys had no business messing down there.  Go places you're not meant to be -- that's what you get.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
Where are we, baby?
It's all arranged for tonight.  Eddie Mack's gonna be there.  And Offisa Korruptsky, too.
Everybody just be cool.  Jimmy, man, I think you oughtta hear the deal.
Sorry, my brother.
Eddie Mack, that cop.  And Jeremiah.  And even when he's done, who knows.  He won't be satisfied.  Just like that demon dog. Feed it, and it just grows hungrier. Feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  Who knows where it'll stop. That kind of hunger ain't never satisfied.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
The dead get out?
You got the cash?
You were just a kid.
Please...help me...
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Or you didn't know what to do with it.
What building?
I didn't sell it.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
You was just doing your job.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
You haven't?
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  Last time I checked, you weren't black.  I'm not sure what the hell you are.  But I know you aren't a black man.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
She's doing the work herself.
It's impossible!
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
The hell I can't!
What are you doing?
Violet!
But everybody is all right.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
How many'd you do?
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
We was worried about you, Cease.
Yeah.
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
You got the key?
Yeah, sure.  I'm Corky.
Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
A favor?
Oh, I'm sorry --
I should be going.  You can drop the cup off anytime.
Thanks.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
What do you want?
He's a launderer?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm already in your bed.
I'm not afraid of anything.
You mean Shelly?
Yes.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  He gets right to the point.  Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What time did you say they would be there?
Gino travels with a big man named Roy.  Caesar calls him the driver.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
There is no going back.
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Hey.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Pop?
Oh, God.
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
You're asking me a direct question?
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
Treadstone?
So now you know.
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
Was it the break-in?
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I need a ride.
I need a ride out of here.
It's a little late for that.
Get the fuck away from my car.
<u>No</u>.  No, that was too easy -- 
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.
Listen to what you want.
Amnesia?  You're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
I kept trying things, I thought if I could find all the things I could do, I could --
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
People do amazing things when they're scared.
Okay, so...
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
What? -- what? --  -- what is it?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
He came to kill us.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
You're wrong.  I didn't know.
You stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- I don't know --  But I can't stay here.  <u>I can't</u>.
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
Where did this body go?
Shit, we didn't sign in.
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
He run away often?
And that's the best angle of the courtyard?
Tell him we're busy.
It doesn't matter now.  We've just got to be the first ones there.  Get everybody up.  I want them all activated.
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
Look, I'm just on this boat, okay? I'm an engineer.  Whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
...ergency procedures.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
What do I have to do.
It's reply paid.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Go away.
Too late? That's for me to say.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
Jack!!
For my sins. Are you settling in alright?
Out of kindness.
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Take her off the list.
Well, I'd better get out there and try to get to her before security does. Let me borrow her dossier for a while.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
No, there's no stamp on it. You see! I can't give you the form until it's stamped.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
It's you ... it's you ...
Bloody hell! Do as I say!
... This is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you ...
Oh. But ... Look, I'm sorry I shouted at you.
What's going on here?
What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
Turn around!
I was right! Step on it!
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Oh, good!
Don't worry.
Really.
Sam Lowry.
Ah, yes, you're the new boy from next door, ha ha!  My name's Lime. Harvey Lime. Welcome to Expediting.
You want to take my console into your office?
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Uh ...
Er, yes ...
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
No, sir.
My I.D. cards.
Yes?
Now look what you've done to him.
What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
I'm sorry Captain. Don't take it too hard.
You swore you'd fire me if I came in late again.
Pregnant.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
You know each other a long time?
Does that hurt?
No.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
Male diff breather, approximately 30, Houston and A.
IB Bangin.
Sure, sure, give go.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
He's working a double shift.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Frank.
She's no whore, Marcus.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
Please, a little decorum if you will. What I was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, I felt like I was twenty-one again. A call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I quit! I'm through!
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
Look up, Frank. Full moon. The blood's gonna run tonight. I can feel it. Our mission: to save lives.
How's he doing?
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.
Why?
Do it!
We're gonna save you, Noel. You're gonna be all right.  Do it, Tom! I'll call for fucking backup, I swear!
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Turn it off.
He's crazy.
You're in the stomach!
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Great.  Network news, Washington... I love it.  What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
And the rule was...
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
We sure do.  I don't mean it as a knock either.  Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
I don't like being handled.
No.  Don't worry about it.
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
I don't think so.
It is.  Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor.  I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
I was there two years and was promoted on merit nine times.
Hi.  Turn on your TV... <u>Good Morning America</u>, the <u>Morning News</u> and <u>Today</u> are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Okay.  Let's do me.
Sure.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
<u>If</u>...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
No.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I think you're the Devil.
Ready.
Stop it.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased.  All right?
Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
Just a few questions?
Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
And Bobbie says...
Because...
No, I don't think so.
Bad manners.
No...no.
I really have to go.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Yes.  You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Oh my.  I see you studying so hard, Tom.  What do you think the problem is?
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Uh-huh.
Hey?
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
What do you mean clean?
I'll wait for you till seven.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
So you like me, huh?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Don't run off --  like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Then give me a minute...
Why?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Well, we should talk.  You going to have time for  dinner?  I'd like you to meet Lila.
Go ahead -- what?
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Well I'm done talking to you, what do I have to do, draw you a diagram!
What, right now?
Not even a little bit?
Walter can I ask you something?
Don't worry about him...what have you got?
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Well...what did you want to talk to me about?
You think I'm creative?
Walter, I'm sorry...
Walter...  I don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  You know what I mean?
Forget it.
Walter...stay away from me!
I hope this was made with egg whites!
What's the matter with you?
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter...
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man look at that get up !
Dead Cat!
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Well Why not?  I gotta make statues Leonard.  You heard Maxwell, they want me to make them.  I can't go back to being a busboy!
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't...
I'm holding for Lieutenant Beldere!
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
Goddammit, where are you from, Mars?
Are you done with these?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I thought you didn't respect money!
Oh, hello Mrs. Swicker.
I had him in my grasp.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Don't grab me, okay?
Figures.
Would you sleep with them?
When you get your car together, man, let's bail.
Yes.
Which way did she go?
Excellent.
Hey, I was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'Don't Tread On Me'.  You know, and a picture of the earth.
Maybe.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
You're even weaker than the others.
Things are kind of confusing.
I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
For the dance.
Come again?
I don't believe this.  The world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you're going to a mixer?
That's me.
I'm glad you came.
Will I get the shit kicked out of me if I ask you to dance?
Bogutude.  Blow it off.
What are we doing?
Where?
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Yeah, whoops I came.
God, where the hell did you come from?  You scared me to death.
Time to do what?
Ow.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Uh... gym.
Who we gonna beat?
No -- you don't have to --
But you threw a knife at my head!
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Don't start with me again.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Vampires of the world, beware.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Football is my life.
So, is Jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
Cool.  We can figure decorations and stuff.
I was just scared is all.
Really?
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
Oh, yes!  Yes!
Okay, let's go.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Buffy!
Wit-tay.
Pike isn't a name.  It's a fish.
They'll kill us!
The homelesses?
Environment.  That's cool with me.
You said "Crash".
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
My right nostril?
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
I'm yours.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
Fundamentals?
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
We lost.
I don't dance.
Why do you get to choose?  Why don't I get to choose?
Oh my...  Don't leave...
Damn.
Don't tell anybody.
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
We gonna fuck or what?
It was a cocksucking call!
Try it!  Go ahead.  Call me a cocksucker!
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Why?!  I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters.  Trust me.
Jesus.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon.  D'you understand that?
Nuke--  Good luck.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
Pussy.
Don't try me.
Little high.
Patkin was a tribute to baseball...
Ain't here.
I mean, the guy is history as far as I'm concerned. History.
But you can't just fire him. Webb's his brother-in-law. He's County Commissioner.
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
The only time I was at the Tangiers was when I had dinner with Barney Greenstein.
He even played golf with the President.
But Andy also took orders. And when he was told to give a pension fund loan to Philip Green...
Why would they want to find out? We're puttin' a hundred million into this desert here. Why would they want to lock us out?  And besides, they'll never find out. All you gotta do is keep changing your job title. Like, uh, from Casino Executive to Food and Beverage Chairman. And what happens it, they take your application, they put it at the bottom of the pile. I know guys workin' there for thirty years, don't have a license.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Hey!
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Where the hell did you learn how to deal? 
It was eight.  Ace... tell him the line on the Bear's game.
I mean, Nicky's a made guy and I'm not. I can't do that.
Be careful. Gaming agents are all over the place.
All right, Ace?
What am I doin' out here? I'm tryin' to make a livin', that's all.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
No, I don't wanna come -
Yeah?
What happened to me? What happened to you?
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
She came to talk to me...
Practice enough this week, you prick?
Yeah.
You know I get calls from back home every fuckin' day?!  They think you went batshit!
Yeah, I did want to go on TV. That way I have a forum. I can fight back. I'm known. People see me. They know they can't fuck around with me like they could if I was an unknown. That's right.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
You never - ?
Yeah, she's here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Well, could there be any position... further down the trough?
Well, that's why they paid so well.
...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car.
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
Help the Senator, give him whatever he wants.
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
I'm okay. I just -  You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just...  I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
It's nice isn't it?
Okay.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
If not for me, at least for Amy.
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
Yes, I - yes, I do.
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
I mean, it could get us both killed.
You are not threatening me anymore!
I am calm!
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Yes, there is. An infallible way! They won!
Can you do it with your left hand?
No, no? You didn't?
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
All right. Okay, okay.
Come on. I'm sorry.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
Here we go!
Nicky, I did -
You took your boots off? You put your feet on the table... you shit- kicking, stinky, horse-manure-smellin' motherfucker you!  You fuck me up over there, I'll stick you in a hole in the fuckin' desert! You understand?  Go over there and apologize.  Go! Get the fuck out of -
He's comin' over.
We're waiting on Carmine.
He's not here?
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting a -
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
You got a round figure on it?
But back then the bosses didn't give a fuck about whether he enjoyed himself of not. To them, he was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money. Especially Remo, who was a fuckin' degenerate gambler who always lost.
Hi, how are you?
Sure.
Am I right?
You mean, like a lot of expensive jewelry? About how much?
Well, I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much. He's jealous and worried.
Okay.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
Thanks.
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
Nicky, please...
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
Get lost, Ginger! Get lost!
No, Lester.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Lester - he called you here.
He called you right here.
Look, there aren't...  There aren't but...
Yeah.
You think he's goin' home, makin' a beef behind my back?
I know. I know.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
Yeah.
Don't know.
Get out. Get out! Get out!
Charlie M.
I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it.
...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application.
What's the matter with you?
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
...done right, you gotta do it yourself.
Yeah.
Yes, uh...
Do I have to remind everyone that in two days, we'll all be dead. The Cult of Good will be a memory. I don't want to hear about lawsuits or cereals. We have a secret mission...

You're probably right.
What did you think?
There you are darling...Have we met, Lewis Lane, Oasisburg Times.
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
You're kidding.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Pass!
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
The shopkeeper on 13th street won't drop the lawsuit--He still claims one of the lasers we fired at the Jenkins gang burned down his store..
What's the catch?
Yeah, this is better than rape.
Can't you understand--I got tired of being a woman. I wanted the respect that only a cape, boots, chestplate, and a mechanical spear can bring..
Sorry, I get carried away. Once I become interested in someone, I can't stop trying to figure them out...Amnesia victims are challenging..
I actually got some memory back last night.
Yes, you shouted the words "Captain God" at me for no reason...
Go together?  Sure, why not?  Another date with someone who could be an insane messenger of death for all I know. No offense. Hey, lean over, let me smell your breath..Say in a deep voice, "A superhero's job is to protect..."
We have to do something. What can we do to help, Selina?
You seem sad, Spooky.
Nice breasts.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
Any place.
Then whose is it?
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
How do we get back to the freeway?
Which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  These are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
It's taken care of.
That was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  I heard you were a hitter.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
Got your badge?
I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours ...
Will you let me explain!
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
The cops could trace this call back to you.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
"Theo?"
What about the others?
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
A woman?
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
A price on everything.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
You can't give up.
Did you hear that click?
God, if he doesn't come back --
Yes sir.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
Why didn't you just shoot them?
Who's in back?
Not all.  They already have a third.  The question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
You won't shoot me.  That's not your style.
I'm not trying to lose them.  Nor am I exceeding any speed limits.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
No, there's a police car way back there.  See it, in the distance coming around the turn?  The van is blocking it now.
What's happening?
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Why are we stopping?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
What's really on your wicked little mind?
It's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
There's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
I don't want to see her later.  I want to hear her <u>now</u>.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And not a nickel.
The fuck I will!
Yeah?
I just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting Rodriego.
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
What does it take to kill you?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
Five minutes.
Take the Getty Center exit -- make a right onto Cisco.  It'll be a narrow winding road.  You can't miss the house.  It's a mansion built back in '29 -- Spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
And make ourselves a hell of a target.
Seems not.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Can I make a quick call?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
See what, Dil?
Ask him.
You fucking promised.
He's going to take his foot off slowly, David. Then you're to go home, like a good boy. You hear me?
Take your clothes.
Look, I'm sorry.
No.
How'd you guess?
Hi.
He's getting up.
You got a special friend, Jimmy?
Tell me about him.
Didn't think I could.
He did sometimes.
Why?
I'm wondering why you keep his things.
Give it over, Dil --
Must be.
Do they know?
Don't ask me in.
Don't be cruel.
Come on.
What you doing, Jimmy?
Yes.
What?
You mean that?
You killed my Jody
Give me a bit more, baby, a bit more.
I like you, DIl
What would you do for me?
Am I in trouble, Jimmy?
As the man said, it's in my nature.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
Fergus!
Hey -- what's he like?
He's hot.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
Leave her out of this.
Of course. I forgot.
Perfect.
And what happens then?
Thanks.
You OK about that?
You sure about that?
I'm sure.
How did you know it was her?
No fucking way.
What's that?
Hey --
I'm not a gambling man.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
So when you come to shoot me, Paddy, remember, you're getting rid of a shit- hot bowler.
Now, that was worth waiting for.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Do you?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Don't think that way.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
The fastest.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
All right -- where's the letter?
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
Oh!
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Reggie -- I think I've found --  are you on?
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I said, tell me to go to the --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Agent.
Very sweet.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
Why not?
Because they're still here.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
No, what?
Café.
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Very pretty. Now what?
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Then who does?
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Sure.
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
There must be some way.
They've got Jean-Louis!
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
I'd love some, thanks.
No sense messing up the streets.
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
Go on.
I don't believe it.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
Do you mind if I sit down?  What about the blue one?
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
And if it is?
You sure nuthin's missin'?
What do you want?
Swiss.
He didn't have one.
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
I was, too.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I don't know -- how would I know?
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
Yes.
Do you know what you're going to do?
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
I'm still having trouble with English.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
What was it?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Be careful, Peter.
What?
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Who is it?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Don't put yourself out.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Do you know him?
How can you tell?
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
A little.
I'm not.
It can't be.
She's not here.
Of what?
No.
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Of course I'm scared.
Then you should go.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
I don't know what I'm so scared of.
Stag?
Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Why?
I heard you got attacked.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
What?
Where are you going?
Who is she?
They were proving to her they weren't. They were very drunk. Things were different back then. You think kids are sexually bottled up today....
How could you?
His mother's side.
Did you want one?
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
Damn.

Oh...
Where's Sam?
Since when does...
Huh?
What did I say?
I need your truck.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
...truck.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
All right.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
What the hell is with you, dog?  He's the one with the damn gun.
That dog ain't mean.
...up.
What the hell's goin' on?

Take your gun!
Doesn't...
...-ed.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
I did not steal the truck.
Back up!  Back...

I think...
I don't think we have much of a choice...
Oh, shit.
God, man!
...easy, easy, easy.
Come on...
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
Ho, ho...
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
Okay.
 Okay.  Okay. 
 Listen!  Listen...
Yeah, he's a dangerous...
...here!






This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.
So you took his...
Yeah, Robert Del Rio.
And I put the car into a ditch.  He spent eighteen weeks in the...
Couldn't deal with it.  So I split.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...deal with this asshole.
A-And you  owe me...

They're movin'.
Hey, just shut up.
Hey, hey, hey.
Reach into my pocket.
Come here.

Oh, fuck!
Shoot me. 
Oh.
It's working.
 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...

Okay.  Come on, big guy!
Look out.

 Well.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

We're the shit.  Bigtime.
 Yeah.
...us.


I urge you to be persuasive.
We've got it...
We do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
If it works, your stock at the Pentagon will go up along with mine.  I don't think I need to mention you could use the help.
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  And let me tell you something else.  I didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the United States into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
...that.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you remember telling me once that all through my career, I'd never fit in?  Well...

Brynner.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...-ians.  But I assure you, Leo...
Dutiful citizens, you have something which I have waited years for.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Check the immediate area.
I'm on it.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
That's right.
We gotta get help.  Aw, fuck!  Damn.
I assume you have one.
...Long.
Not tonight...
...never done a thing for you?
Hello.
...the river.
...-tainer!

Dead, last time I...

You'd never understand!
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
...he's smart enough to get you...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Ah.
You got thirty minutes.
It's after five...
Great.  All right...
Colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
It's not over, Brynner.

That little geek is my...
Uh-huh.
...colonel?
One of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
There's nothin' goin' on out there, doc...except maybe the occasional fly fisherman.
Tie a fly...
...-to a simple thing like...
 ...or it'll ignite. 
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I don't sell beer to minors.  I take that kinda thing...
...public drunkenness....


Look at that.
'Course you do, Jake.
It doesn't hurt.
They're calling it an accident.
Where from?
We worked in Chinatown together.
Would you call him a capable man?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
What for?
His girlfriend?
Yes, his girlfriend.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
I've still got a few teeth in my head, Mr. Gittes, and a few friends in town.
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
They don't kill a guy for that.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
I'll just tell my wife.
I'll throw that in too.
There's seven ashtrays in this room, Duffy.
Why?
You're behind the times, Jake. They've got steam irons now.  And I'm out of Chinatown.
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Oh yes.
Or her name?
What pictures?
It's too late.
Where?
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
I guess not.
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Mrs. Mulwray, it's a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. It's a felony.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
I think so. Something besides your husband's death was bothering you. You were upset but not that upset.
Mr. Gittes.
No. I'm just a snoop.
How did it happen?
Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
Of course I'm sure.
That dam is a con job.
Why?
Easy, it's an innocent question.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
What were you doing there?
Hold still. Why?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
What about it?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Where's the girl?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Sophie.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
When did you come in?
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Naturally, I want the best for him, money is no object.
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.
After all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. Well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
Yes?
The L.A. River?
Sure you do.
Gittes.
He owned the entire water supply for the city?
How did they get it away from him?
Apple core?
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Oh? What do you do to make ends meet?
Is the Pope Catholic? Who are you, mister?... I ask because he doesn't see a whole lot of people.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
No, he's only got one, I remember her age, I read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
You don't say?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso? 
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed.  When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am. 
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh? 
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Hi, Elena!
Father, I have sinned...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
I've been looking for you all day. Did you buy the milk?
"Miss Susan Alexander, a pretty but hopelessly incompetent amateur -  - last night opened the new Chicago Opera House in a performance of - of -"  I can't pronounce that name, Mr. Kane.
"Her singing, happily, is no concern of this department.  Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to..." 
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low...  Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
I might make him nervous.
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
You're pretty young, Mr. -  Mr. Thompson.  A fellow will remember things you wouldn't think he'd remember. You take me.  One day, back in 1896, I was crossing over to Jersey on a ferry and as we pulled out, there was another ferry pulling in -  - and on it, there was a girl waiting to get off.  A white dress she had on - and she was carrying a white pastrol - and I only saw her for one second and she didn't see me at all - but I'll bet a month hasn't gone by since that I haven't thought of that girl.  See what I mean?  Well, so what are you doing about this "Rosebud," Mr. Thompson.
Who else you been to see?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Welcome, Mr. Kane, to the "Enquirer." I am Herbert Carter.
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
There is no news big enough.
But, Mr. Kane -
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm protecting myself every way I know how, Mrs. Kane.  This last week, I finally found out how I can stop your husband from being elected. If the people of this state learn what I found out this week, he wouldn't have a chance to - he couldn't be elected Dog Catcher.  Well, what I'm interested in is seeing that he's not elected.  I don't care whether they know what I know about him.  Let him keep right on being the Great, Noble, Moral -  Champeen of the people.  Just as long as -
What story, Mr. Rogers?
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Where's the towel?
A chicken?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't say.
Yes -
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Would you sing for me?
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Goodbye, Charlie.
Thanks.
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Can't say, sir.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
It's been a tough day.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Yesterday morning you called the President a traitor.  What do you think that crowd is doing down there?  They think you murdered him.
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
Why, Brad?
I don't think so, Brad.  We've just had word that the President is out of danger.  It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Why is she leaving me?
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
Mr. Thatcher is going to take you on a trip with him tonight, Charles. You'll be leaving on Number Ten.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
Was he in love?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
Are you serious?
What the hell is that?
Unnhh!
Jesus!
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?
Just now.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged.
How like her.
I'm giving him his ring back.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it.
Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...
We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Are you sure somebody was back there?
Then who operated the store?
Well he asked me for it!
What about Caitlin?
Excuse me?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
In a second!
I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD! YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!
Well, he missed!
What am I worried about?  He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests.  I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.
Your mother.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
You think things would be any different now?
Caitlin's on the same wave-length?
Empire.
I guess.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
Wait.
What's he looking for?
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
I know.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
I'm going to miss the game.
Pull my laces tighter.
Are you gonna lock the store?
I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
You've had sex with a dead person.
She meant nothing to you!
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Stop it.
You know.
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Fine. Just lend me your car.
May I be blunt with you?
Jesus!
Then how come you got the fine?
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
I'm happy.
You're kidding.
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Hey, what about Veronica?
All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks.
Who eats cock?
There's no lights back there.
I love your sexy talk. It's so... kindergarten: Poo-poo; wee-wee.
What time did we go to the funeral?
Leave me alone.
You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.
It's the same thing with Veronica.
You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!
If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...
The swelling's not so bad. But the FDS stings.  How's your neck?
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
How much can you bench?
Yeah.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
It's not my store.
A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
You used to go out with her?
Is she that girl who's down here all the time? She came here today carrying a plate of food.
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
At least they weren't lit.
I hate this fucking place.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
How flattering.
How many?
How many different girls? Didn't we already have this discussion once?
You!
No; who were the three, besides me?
Why do you call him that?
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
He gets off on it.
Why do you say that?
Something like thirty-six.
He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class?
Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch.
Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee?
If you didn't want to go out with me anymore, why didn't you just say it? Instead, you pussyfoot around and see that slut behind my back!
You hold the counter and I'll pull.
Excuse me, but have you been here all day?
I'm not out of shape!
What are you talking about?
No way.
What part of Russia?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
No way!
It's probably from being around all this food every day.
You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I didn't even recognize you!
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
I don't think your manager would appreciate...
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
Dental School.
Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
I don't know.
And it's such a handsome head. Please Frank, and I swear I'll buy one of your paintings.
Throw it up or I'll kill her.
I'm coming out!
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
How's your leg? I'll live.  Where'd you leave Jessie?
I'm going with you.
Room service...Hi, Sarah.
She's tough.
Four...five...
Help me!  I don't want to die!
Patience my love, patience.
That's a virtue isn't it?
Hello, Gabriel.
Where've you been?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
Resuscitation?
You got to go back now!
Before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. They're using Hal for a bird dog. Once they find the money, Hal's dead.  So get on your radio, contact Frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  Do it Jessie.
They've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  How are you holding up?
I can't believe you just said that.
Can you see light?
Gabe are you alright?
No luck?
Start pulling it apart!  We're climbing down on it.
Never, what?!
There's no "we".  There's a me. All I have to do is make it along the north wall to Bitker Ladder. What you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. And don't put on that mad face.
My heart can't take much more of this.  Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
Good memory.  You must be great with numbers.
It's up there, on the Tower.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!
Murdering, motherfucker...
What's your names?
Why?  What are you going to do?!
You got what we need?
Rich...
I'd like to have a word with you. This is Agent Matheson, FBI.
Mostly.  Armored cars can be hijacked.  Trains can be derailed.  But nobody can get to us in flight.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.
Yes. They want to help.
Help me, sir?
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, satisfactory, yes?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should be clear by this afterlunch.
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned against music.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and violence?
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely reformed.
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid. He slaps Alex in the face.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
Do you mean Church of England?
No, sir.
No, sir.
No, sir.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?
Yes!!!
How are you feeling today?
Fine. Fine.
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money back.
Good. What do you want?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
And when do I get out of here then?
What's all this about sin?
You're not cured yet, my boy.
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
You have, my son.
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Very good, Chief. They inspect cells.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
Don't read it - sign it!
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.
How many to a cell?
Shall we go to my office?
Hi ya' doin'?  Where to?
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
You like Bach?
Violin.  I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
This?  Temporary.  To pay the bills and save. I got plans...
Just had one.
You still carrying passengers?
Jesus...
Lay it on me.
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
I picked up a tail.
Hell, make it fifty.  Same goes for any business we have in the future.
Very generous.
You guys been holding hands?
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
Client?  I like to think of myself as more of a friend.  A mentor.
I got caught up at work.
You're gonna cheer up.
I was just tryin' to...to...
You hassling my driver again?
Same fare you talked to last time. The U.S. Attorney...
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
It got crashed!  I didn't...
Hello?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You prefer nights?
You mean like benefits?
It's not that kind of job.
Why not?
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
No.  You say you're cool.
You were going to drive me around. Drop me at LAX.  Never be the wiser. But El Gordo missed the elevator.  So we go to Plan B.  Pop the trunk.
What about that?
What?
Chopin prelude.  Stodgy, but nice.  Here's the deal.  I didn't want you involved in this.  Still breathing? But now that you are, we have to make the best of it, Max.  Improvise.  Life is that way.  Adapt to your environment.  Survive.  Darwin.  "Shit happens."  The I Ching.  Whatever. Roll with it.
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
What do you care?  Ever hear of Rwanda?
I don't know any Rwandans.
I listen to classical.
I never learned jazz.
What you mean, no?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Show up for <u>what?</u>
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
Yeah?  What happened?
I'm sorry.
It's not bullshit.
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
Whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
That's what you said...
How do I know?  But, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  Probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  I dunno.
That's the "why."  That's the why? There is no reason.  No good reason; no bad reason.  To live or to die.
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
None of your business.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
Why the hell not?
I was only going one way.
What're you thinking, Jerry?
Water mains usually go in the winter.  It's August 1st.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Just relax.
Hey...  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So I'm a little jumpy.  Who wouldn't be?
Pretty scary, huh?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  But they're all part of two warring factions. One:  families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing.  Stability. Group Two:  the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex.  They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business.  When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Where were you the day he died?
Can't give you the details because I can't remember.  I went to court to kill him.  At the Ezekiel Walters hearing.  I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
I believe you.
Get in.  I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
Ah, your psychotic is here.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Tell me about it.
While we walk.  D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink.  Here to I.D. Fletcher.  They knew each other somehow.
Can I talk to you a second?
What?
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Very well; since my appointment he's been made interim director.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Are you threatening me?
J39 Z186...?
Ellie.  Pulsar?
Here, right around Centaurus A.
I'm saying you might have consulted us; the contents of this message could be extremely sensitive...
So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
You're not real.  None of this is.
So.  Are you an hallucination?  Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
Originally just another species like yourselves.  Well, not like you at all actually, but...
No.  Please.
What kind of deal?
And in return?
It's so... small.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
Keep it down, okay?  Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.  Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes.  Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
How close are you to getting this funding put together?
I'm -- I'm fine.
Spoken like a true believer.
And mind, yes.  What are you --
Can you try?
Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent.  But this experience went beyond both.  For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
If you came back.  If you survived at all.  Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
An excellent question, Doctor.  But what if we don't like the answer?
So.  The final countdown.
I can't hear this now --
I do.
You're sure you want to?  In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show.  What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
It also makes God enormous.  I think of the scope of your universe, Ellie... and it takes my breath away.  As it will everyone else's.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
Yeah, well, Arletta, you done your best. What I done with myself is my problem.
Yeah.
Here, Mom.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
Please! Please!
Here, Captain.
In the Navy, we used to call guys --
Borrowin' or payin' back?
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?
I'm gonna kill you, you go on...
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
We ain't goin' nowhere.
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Man, it's so hot.
I'm in.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
What are you talking about?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
The test criteria are only part of what we look at in evaluating subjects.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
Who are you?
I was?  How you spell that?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
The door was already open...
I'll look for it, Daryll Lee.
Bet you never figured I'd follow in your footsteps.  It's real well- written.  You should read it -- you're in it.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Is he out?
Because of your phone calls.
Would you want to work with us on this?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
It was a lover or a husband. Someone close.  Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
How did you know they were stockings?
I'm going to put a guard on your door.
Maybe that's why you can't catch him.  I <u>know</u> what she looks like -- the red-headed woman in my computer.
Then what do you need me for?
Have you got a warrant?  Get the hell out o here!  This is the <u>only space I have left in the</u> <u>world</u>!  Why can't you leave me out of it?
You betrayed me!  Now every psychopath in the city knows I'm back in business... You lied to me!
I did not; the Mouth -- that's what we call Susan Schiffer -- got it on her own.
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
What's that siren?
What I can't believe is that in an earlier life I slept with him! Christ!  Any God that loved his people would give women a rewind on their life and an erase button.  Just give me a minute here.  The letter is addressed to me...  You don't feel fear, do you? You're young.  You feel like you'll live forever.  How wonderful.
They're not talking to me.  Saks looks right through me.  I ask him for some bodies, for the phones -- he's so encouraging: "you make that <u>your</u> little job."  Condescending bastard.  Helen, on your lists to call is San Quentin.  Daryll Lee Cullum?
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
This has been the worst 48 hours of my life.  I'm going home.  I'm going to try to get drunk.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
You know how to use this?
Merry, how... oh, Christ, of course, you had my phone tapped.
Just get out of your vehicle...
Hello.  I am  Meryhew Saks.  The song is called "Murder By Numbers."  The performers are a group called The Police.  Adam here... ... from Behavioral Science is working out exactly what this perpetrator is trying to telegraph in the note.  This is an extremely complex case, and we have a lot of fancy theories floating around. We're not ruling out the possib- ility of three Copycat serial killers.  We have Quantico working on graphology, the Washington lap is cloning DNA from the secretor. It's our feeling that the best lead we have is the two sperm samples in one of the victims.  We have a team sweeping sperm banks.  Now I want to say a few word to you local people.  Your Commissioner asked for our assistance.  The Bureau does not send us in on these cases to lord it over the local police. We couldn't catch up on what you people know if we had a year.  We have nation-wide resources and hard state of the art forensic science; you have the local savvy.  Together we can be unbeatable.  Which one is Inspector Halloran?
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
It's none of my business anymore...
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
What's wrong with him?
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
What's Abba?
Anybody in this department ever worked a serial killer case?  She's the expert.  I need help.
You ever reflect how this big explosion in dead women coincides with the flowering of women's lib?
So.  Do we tell the media and hope for somebody to come forward with information?
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Inspector, will you confirm somebody is copying the Boston Strangler?  This is the fourth, is that correct?
Did you come?
Not a lot of action here.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
It does.
One of your suitors?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
And did you fantasize that Vaughan was photographing all these sex acts? As though they were traffic accidents?
No.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
Crash victim?
You could get your wish at any moment.
Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
Drugs can help suppress symptoms. But lots of patients stop taking them when they're on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  And, Michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. He's been in and out of...
I think it's about that time, Letty. The charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
So, we'll meet every Tuesday and Friday. And if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
I have a going-away gesture for you, too.
Sage, rosemary...  Les Herbes.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
But what am I going to do?
Are you sure, Dear?
Oh, Letty, what happened?
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'll see you soon.
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.
We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
Honestly, Letty.
I will, Dear. I promise.  Why McDonald's?
What if it's got a pattern?
You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
Really, this isn't funny.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
Yeah.
No, I need some serious household advice.
It's TV heaven.
Do you like it?
Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
Yeah?
Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
Why'd you tell?
I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Forget I asked.
I'm sorry.  I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
Are you all right?
I hope it wasn't something I did.
So will you?
What's so urgent?   You've got me worried.
I've got a deposition that I really need to get cracking on, so if you don't mind...
I know, Letty. But the incident with Zach was frightening for the children.  Now if you'd come to me, explained what was going on...
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
I need someone to work on budget projections.
Office work?
What are you doing?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
You want the tapes for yourself.     You're going to sell them.
When this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I'll be long gone. Besides, who's going to believe you? You're just a two-bit crook.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
Hello?
It's Elvis...
You're there now?
You're calling me on is phone?
You don't trust me?
Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about the Van Gogh.
Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You want something?
I understand Bobby Beans came to see you today.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
And the other half?
I'll destroy them when we get back to Paris.
This plane will take you to Canada. From there you can fly back to Paris.
We can't.
Why not just steal another one?
Hopefully no one.
Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.
Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?
We still have to get out of here.
If they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. That would have left us with nothing.
Man, I can get anything.
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
Why haven't you turned us in?
And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
-- Did you set it up?
-- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.
What'd you guys find?
There has to be.
Don't tell me to be cool! We were supposed to be in and out. In and out! In the last twenty four hours we've managed to get the Mafia... the FBI... the Chicago Police Department and a group of Latin gang members after us. I haven't left out anyone, have I?  I don't think so, because we've already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
It's my idea.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?
Mr. Zammito?
Uh huh.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we've got to figure out what's going on.
You like shoes?
How's the arm?  Still sore?
Much better.  You've been gone so long.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
What's it to you?
You're home late... or should I say early?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
You're already a thief.
That was just for fun.  How can I leave?  Where would I go?
I studied the diagrams.  But you hid the details!
If I hadn't seen you fight with Li Mu Bai, I'd still be ignorant of all you've hidden from me.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
I am not an aristocrat, as you are... but I must still respect a woman's duties.
You, sister...
You know about Lo?
Give it back!
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
So you're still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I'll look around and catch up later.
It's Jade Fox!
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
This is a delicate matter.
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
And you're gonna tell me who.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Thank you.  For giving a damn.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
I don't know you.
You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for?
You buying?  He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
T-Bird?
Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar.
I can see her.
Does it hurt?
Miss her?
You'll be alone.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
I had heard something like this.  Describe it for me.  The "hit".
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Are you okay?
Excuse me?
You what?
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
From who?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
Got a boyfriend back home?
I read your teen beat manifesto.
You did?
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
What? Another letter from your friend?
Shut up.
Why not?
You're naked.
That's repulsive.
How are you today?
Okay?
"I actually feel good about myself?"
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Where did you say she's from?
I don't think that bothered him.
Why?
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
You'd do that for me?
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
He made you give him a blow job.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
I want to go home.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?
What are you doing?
Same time next week?
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Positive.
And you think she bought it?
She bought it.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
I don't find this very funny,
So that's what this is all about.  We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
Sounds intriguing.
I'll think about it...
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
Call me later.
No.
Any day now.
Yippy.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
She shot you down.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Where'd she go?
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
No, tell me.
Some other time.
No, I'm not.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Get out!
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Yes, you already did.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Did you hit her?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
What are saying, darling?
Where did you get this ring?
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I think I should.  3000W?
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
It's your play.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
It's true.
And this one's for Mrs. Farren.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
But where is that?
For as long as you'll let me.
There's an oak leaf.  Add a maple.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You wanted to share this moment with me.
Yes, Amy.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
But what happened to the little deer?
The Headless Horseman --
Hide me? Why?
Hurry, hurry.
Yes...yes, that's true.
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Amy looks happy — seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.
No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.
She refuses to deny it. She continues to believe in her lies.
I'm lucky Jen's not like that.
You shouldn't smoke. It'll kill you.
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
Translation: a total geek.
Only to see.
George bit you?
What I really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "Can I use your phone?" "How about a nightcap?" "I want to meet your cat." And my all-time favorite, the old standby, "I have to use your bathroom."
Where? Where do you think a mustache would be. Look!
No. I don't think so.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I wonder if he's married.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
Why the fuck would you do that?
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
Peter keeps asking me out.
"Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." Nothing about turning into a werewolf.
Guess she never found true love.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
I thought you and George were getting married.
I wish I only had your problems.
Man I'm starving too, I think I'll go for the Surf and Turf.
Come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
What?
Yes I do have to pee!
These guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. They're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
You think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
Somehow this winds up being my fault? You always blame me.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
On your desk.
Coffee and...
No.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You know, I've never seen your cat.
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Peter I love you too but...
What about... those guys... I might have...
Here's a towel.
We didn't have sex.
Take some allergy medicine.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Maybe. What about all those hairs they found on his body?
Madonna's in Penthouse?
I still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
Yes.  That's right.  He's ill  -  he needs expert help.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
It seems fine.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
I don't know who they are.
Why are they after you?
No.  I, ah...
Then we must call the police.
Did she drown?  The woman you told me about?
I'm sorry.  About before.
If you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
What's with her?
Right and don't embellish.
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  All you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
What do you think you're doing?!
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Clean.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
Couple of days.  Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
So you want to go swimming?
I'm not sure.
Choices?
What happened?
Will he be alright?
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Presence.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
Now he's making stuff up about me.
No,  sir.  It's more of a perceptual issue.
Why?
Oh... Thanks.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?
You mean with you and everything?
`Bleed for your king.'
That's okay.  You alright down here by yourself?
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Oh yeah?  Me, too.
They asked me to help.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
I really don't have much of an appetite.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
So this is it?
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?
Quiet!
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
gonna change, young lady. Now if you still got a statement you'd like ta make, you can jus' hold onto it 'til tonight.
Tonight?
It's not a very big army. And small as it is you won't be able to continue feeding it for very long. We've got to find ways of getting them to respond without relying on...
How we gonna break the curse without a prayer or two.
If you could knock out the central communications room you could foul up their whole intercom system. Then, if you move fast enough, stay ahead of 'em...without bein' able to signal each other, they might have a hard time catchin' you.
I didn't realise! Those were de-caps! I didn't know that....de-caps... revived!
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
My..."detail", sir. We're going to bury the heads.
Sounds boring to me.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
At Chet Danburry's house.
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
What is this "Dead Potts Society"?  I want names.
It's only me, Mr. Nolan.  I swear. I made it up.
Where'd you find them?
What happened? Were you kicked out?
No.
It does?  What?
What are you doing?!
Knox, I don't believe this!
Chris!
Knox, you are so infuriating!
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
A yawp?
Good god, boy! Yell!
Use your imagination!  First thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
Ah, but I am seeing the world, Neil. The new world.  Seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  It's worth everything.  That's why I came back here. A place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  Did you come here to talk about my teaching?
You can't live a life for someone else, Neil.  You can only live for yourself. Have you told your father what you just told me?  Have you shown him your passion about acting?
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Wait a minute.  I don't let my parents walk on me.
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Weird.
Where is this cave he's talking about?
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
But why?  Don't you understand what Keating is saying?  Don't you want to do something about it?
But if he said no before then...
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Er  No.
It's my birthday.
I'll come to the performance.
You the Captain?
How do we get out of here?
It's not going to help us!
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
How soon can we get up and running?
Great woman your mother. Real foresight.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Maybe we lost them.
The thieves.
I'm not a thief.
What are you people talking about?
I was born in a City housing project in the Bronx OK? It's not in the cards that I die on a luxury cruise ship...now which way up?
Self sufficient...
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Yeah you did...
Oh yeah? What kind is that?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
Can we use our indoor voice please...
If I told you once...I told you a thousand times...
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
That's it? That's all you give a shit about?
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!
She fucked us both.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Yes, Albert?
Who's going?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
What the --!
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
You don't!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Married?
He's real bad, Nick.
No.
See, I'm going home.
Ah yes. Of course.  To the girl who waits.
Where is he???
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Merle? That's who we're looking for. Merle.
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Kind of. You didn't know?
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Linda... Hey, Linda...
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Will you marry me?
No.
How's the trailer?
Frost.
Yeah... All the guys, we're all going huntin'. Like we did. You know? Like we always used to.
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
You can do it, Sal.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
You do?
What are you, God?
What are you, hoping?
I thought you might be praying.
Nick, you're wasting your time... Listen to me! You're wasting your time! This is no fucking time for hoping or praying or wishing or any other shit! This is it. Here we are... And we gotta get out!
Forget Sal?
Merle...
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Here, here! This is it!
No.
Where's Vince?
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
What's that noise?
I'm gonna stay here, Nick.
Sal, we need you. We need you.
Did you go hunting.
Well... Phantom Mary's on my mother's side. Naturally no one there admits it because Phantom Mary's pretty weird... You want to hear the whole story?
He's getting married... and we're nuts!
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
My man Dubbs.
Speak up.
You son-of-a-bitch.  How do you stop it?
I don't want to hear anymore.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Are you a cop?
You have to use the steering wheel to turn.  The pedal for gas...
She's pretty.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
I'm serious, Wade.  This case is important to me.
Wanna try?
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
You should be in hospital.
You could always take it off.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
We'll cook 'em ourselves. You'll help me, Belle.
I didn't.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
Loan shark -- hey?
No, Stone!
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
Now run along, Daniel.
I do -- and I think you should too.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
I -- I don't know what you're talking about! I -- I haven't time to listen to all this --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Seed alone won't do, Mary. We have to throw the calf in.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
Yes -- you are right, Mary. I can almost hear the little blades of grass a-starting up -- All the seeds a-stirring underneath the ground --
Mary --
Mary, get three cups of camomile tea for the Squire and the rest. They all feel colds coming on.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
It shows on your face.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Hush up such talk, Jabez!
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Lan's, I'd think you was having the baby, to hear you.
Why, that's just sense, Son. Now a man like Daniel Webster -- guess they pay him high for what he does. But he's worth it -- and he helps others. Makes all the difference.
Oh, here you are, Jabez. Lan's, I was worried about you.... Hail in August! The crops will be ruined!
It don't matter!
My son ... what's the matter?
Yep -- you can't get around that mortgage. -- I'm sorry, Jabez.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Mary -- Jabez --
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
What's that?
Mary -- what love and trust could do for your husband, you've done. And frankly, in a very few moments, this is going to be no place for a lady.
Attorney of record for Jabez Stone. Might I ask your name?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
I wanted to give it all to the church.
What are you going to do?
Hope I'm not interrupting...?
Nothing...
He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs.  And his bag is missing.
You...you're an American?
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.
How long?
Three down, four to go --
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
Especially my name.  You must miss it every time you write a check.  When did you start calling yourself 'Ms. Gennero'?
How do you know?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Powell?  What's going on?
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
The terrorists?  Don't know, Sir. We haven't heard a peep from them.
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Gene -- you smilin'?
Aw, hey...
They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you.
They're not after you, they're after me.
Jackie - what are you talking about?
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Hello, Sonny.
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it.
What trip?
I know that.  I'm warped... I'm warped!
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
What?
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
Let Sal come out, take a look. What hope you got?  Quit while you're ahead.  All you got is attempted robbery.
Calm down, you're not ...
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
The girl hostages.
No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you.
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Well, what were you doin' back there?
What else?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Howard, give him the keys...
Where's the back door?
You got kids?
You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay ... and he's not going back to prison ... One time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way.
We like you, too.
What now, Sonny?
It's up to you ladies.
Did you always call him Junior.
Let's go, Sonny.
... The bodies out the door.
Maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
I never been up in a plane before.
Sal?
Why couldn't he talk about that here?
First off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages.
Bullshit!
I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it.
Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think.
Hey, let's get ready!
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Oh.  Run.
I'm a fuckup and an outcast.  There isn't one single person in my life I haven't hurt through my love. You understand that?  I'm the most dangerous person in the world, because if I love you, watch out, you're gonna get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
Doing what?
Where are we going?
Bail jumper's name is Cookie Kincaid. Nineteen years old. His mommie posted bail when he was arrested for allegedly partaking in a drive-by shooting in Hawthorne.
Fella could get used to a life this ordinary.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
My armored car business. We just signed a new insurance policy in Nevada. There's a loophole.
Where is the money?
I don't know.
Is that the decoder?
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
God help us. God help us all.
You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
Domino. Do you have a last name... Domino?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
There are no bond certificates.
Something is going down. Something bad.
What did he say about the arm?
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
We are so fucked.
Many times.
Do you know where Danang is?
How you be?
What do you want to live in a Black neighborhood for?  Motherfuck gentrification.
That's not even true.  I just want a slice.
No, you the man.
As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
Besides that.  Da Mayor don't bother nobody.  Nobody don't bother Da Mayor but you.  Da Mayor just mind his business.  I love everybody. I even love you.
I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama.  Maybe I should be heroic more often.
I hope the block is still standing.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all.  I'm carrying you as it is.
No, you're tripping.  Don't come in Sal's.  Alright, read my lips.
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Number One: I got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house.  Every year I keep threatening to sell it.
D, not C.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
ML?
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
You're right, a kid is dead, but Mook, this isn't the time.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Before I get off work.
Tina, you are too slick.
What else?
Trust me.
I'm gonna take off ya clothes.
You talk to 'em.
What?
Magic Johnson.
I'll be back after I make this delivery.
That's the dope.
Sez who?
Stop busting my balls.  I said I'm listening ten fucking times already.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Turn it off.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Both of youse--shaddup.  This is a place of business.
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Oh my god, are you alright?
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Yeah. How'd you know?
MS. HELLER said not to talk to you.
O'clock?
She says that she's got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
Here's your lunch. And an apple and banana for extra energy.
No thanks, not hungry. Harry Dunne. Why does that name not sound familiar?
Don't we want them to talk to us?
Who's Principal Collins?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
Oh, is this your special place?
I know the type. Lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
I will stop this car right now.
I didn't know that.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
You're it.
Can he do that?
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?
I lugged it all over town!
Start the tape, Lloyd.
Oh my God! She's two-timing PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
Well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps I think it's newsworthy.
I thought I told you to get lost.
You had some questions.
That's not your tape.
You're just jealous.
HARRY, I heard Collins has you in some kind of special class.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Checking up on my friend, Harry.
Oh, baby, you're the bestest.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
It's the big potato.
Guess what"s under these coconuts.
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
I understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, Doctor.
Yes?
Yes, my Lord.
We'd have joined each other in death. However, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Do you know this my lady?
I can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  Maybe that small rock.
No.
Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in a dream.  A treasure.
The Water of Life.
Did they try and fail?
Bring me two more Beefeater martinis. Eddie will have another whiskey, Dagmar's a Rum-and-coke, Moustapha and King are chablis -- hey Bela, would you like a wine?
Why were you buying a coffin?
Thank you.
Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
Who do I play?
But we need to start off with a bang! Something we <u>know</u> the audience will want to see.  Mmm.  What was your biggest hit?
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
What's in the needle?
I didn't know if it was a trick. They might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  I am Hungary's most famous emigrant. they'd use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
What are you doing?
Don't you have any savings?
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Oh.  So what is the scene about?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
Wow.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
Oh, the hell with you.  I met BELA LUGOSI!
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Who cares?!  We're on a ROLL!  These are the moments in life you're supposed to grab.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
What other sixty-thousand?
Raising money is tough.
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But Tor, it's a starring part! You're second billed.
Excuse me, Sir...?
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Welles, is it all worth it?
Is there a script?
It opens in nine weeks in Tulsa.
So you're not a fruit?
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
The marriage already ended.
Oh, it's you again.
<u>Right now</u>.  Let's drive to Vegas!
No, don't worry, I moved on.  I was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "Bride Of The Monster."
What octopus motor?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
Isn't it wonderful?  Bela lives!
I thought this was a group effort.
Why... yes.
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
Two people do.  Orson Welles and me.
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
What if I'm vomiting?
Yeah. I brought you some movies.
What?!
What?
I'11 tell you something else. The old guy in the wheelchair? The stepfather? They're gonna have him die.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
How you doing, Ed?
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
What if Shari's the dream?
Al!
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
How's Marcia? She all right?
Who?
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Oh God. What hospital?
It was horrible. He called me up.
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
Right, yeah --
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
Never would be plenty.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Hey, Lou.
I hear the dog really liked him.
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
Leave. Go.
So...?
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
I'm sorry.
Where?
You weren't able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, I admit -- and my problem is, if I think I'm losing, I pull myself out of the game. I bail. See? I told you, I'm the love coroner.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
That's like... those people stitching Nikes in Panama saying they're in the NBA.
I ... I'm not gonna do it.
What?
You're gonna be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? This is your big ambition, rearranging the "Ernest" movies?
Hey, Ed. Did you hear about Marcia?
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
Ray --
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Come on, Ma.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
Mr. Pekurny. I'm sorry to bother you. My son would just love to have your autograph.
You don't recognize me.
Who is it?
I was in jail.
Check forging.
Oh!!
El/ella -
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
You're kidding, right?
I thought those were the rules, Mr. McAllister. If they've changed in any way --
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Hey, that's super
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Sure
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
A travesty.  Huh.  That's interesting, because I think you did it.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
Okay, Tracy, so who do you think did it?  Whom should we "interrogate?"
Why are you lecturing me?
Oh.  New cars.  I see.  Well, you came to the right place
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
What's this?
I hope so
I'm the one.  I did it.  I tore down Paul's posters.
Exactly when?
Here?
More this way.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
points at the motel.
All his life.  He's tried everything.
Right now?
No way I It doesn't make sense.
Sorry. My figures work out exactly the same as Jim's. 256 for Paul, 255 for Tracy.
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
What?
These are private -- these are for us.
We still have some extra ones, don't we?  Maybe we can just --
Who put you up to this?
Somebody hit you?
Are you sorry she's dead?
Yes.  But do you know?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
It's Lynn.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
You say 'fuck' a lot.
But you did it anyway.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Maybe.  I don't know.
Where are we going?
It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  <u>Justice</u>.
It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl?
For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice.
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
But she's moving away from the door.  Who was sitting at this table?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Clean?
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Believed what?
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Nobody.  At least not yet.
Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund.
Sir, I took the call.  It's my case.
Why?
A disgrace as a policeman. Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under. What about him?
You're the payoff expert.  I'm just doing my duty.
I need to speak to you.
I ain't a priest, Lieutenant.  I can't hear your confession.
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
It's a simple question.
Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar.
What's that for?
Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on?
What?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour.
A sweet man.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure?
Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back.
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Why?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Who are they?
What do they have to do with this?
It's a SAT-tracker.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
We said a hundred.
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
They come after you?
Jesus. Do you have proof?
They're here.
<u>Here</u>?!
What the fuck?!
Gimme that.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
What about newspapers and magazines?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
No.
Baudmore Consultants.
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
Law enforcement?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
What size?
I know, but--
About what?
Than why don't you talk to the bus driver?
Was he with anyone?
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
What?
I saw a man die.
I'm sorry.
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
What do you mean?
Stacy?
I went to the grocery store. My ATM and credit cards didn't work. I couldn't buy food.
Stacy, somebody's trying to kill me. Now goddamit--
Yes.
That's okay.
...who root through...uh...presents, and...
Maybe it's not connected yet.
I don't believe it is, no.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
No, I meant I'm Presbyterian.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Who's doing this?
You being audited?
I'm gonna fix it.
I <u>did</u> care how.
This conversation's over.
He didn't.
--otherwise we may have to--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
Excuse me, have any of you seen an eight year old boy, good looking, about yea-big.
Where've you been?
Yeah.
Did they take your clothes?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
No, but they took my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
What?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Christ!
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
To the NSA. Make a deal. Tell 'em to stop. Tell 'em I don't have what they're after. Make a deal.
I need help.
How can I reach you?
The police?
What is it you want?
Why not?
"I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II.
Sir--
You're kidding me.
Found him. Kent Island nailed the call five minutes ago. He's stationary.
What's your ETA?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
Federal Express?
We're not stupid, Reynolds.
No.
Excuse me?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Actually, you sing.
What's this?
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
Do they know them?
No.
No.
This is - what is this?
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
Shall we be all right?
Yes.  Absolutely.
A broken car?
You too.  Good luck!
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
Almásy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Which we've overflown twice.
What's the matter with you?
Look, either shut up, or go home.
I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
Well, you must know.  You were brought up Libya, yes?
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
So you can shoot a pistol?
You have to protect yourself from sadness.  This is the thing I've learned.  You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient.  Do you think he's a saint or something?  Because of the way he looks?  I don't think he is.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Where did you find that?
Well, then ask him his name!
Hello.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Darling, I just heard.  You poor sausage, are you all right?
Sweltering.  Come on, I'll take you home.
Apprentices.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
Your friend?
That's a different dress.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
You get Hardy.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
And what if he really is a spy?
He can't even move.
Why Picton?
Hello miss.
I'll ask the Lieutenant.  But thank you.
Only we have to go to work.
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
Then you were married?
We've got to catch him in the act.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
He's on to something bigger.
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
I didn't expect you to be so...
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
No. Why would I be?
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
It's a test.
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
I know it well.
I go in alone.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
True enough.
Someone was expecting that.
So how long to pop the floor?
Thank you.
He wasn't.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
We did it.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
What's that?
And the money goes--
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
So how long till we do this?
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
There's always a surprise.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Gin, really.
In the van.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR/Thermo camera?
The key to success is using the right tools.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
This is just show and tell.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
You're giving them to me?
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Tony Marvin.
Which one?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
This is the only thing you found?
That wasn't an offer.  A million would've been an offer.  When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Erin --
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
And that's what caused the contamination?
They skipped that step.
Someone's following me.
What?  Who?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
So why would PG&E offer it?
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
Morning!
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Two million dollars?
When'd they file the demur?
Corey.
I was working in the compressor, and out of nowhere the supervisor calls me up to the office and says, we're gonna give you a shredder machine, and send you on down to the warehouse.  We want you to get rid of all the documents stored out there.
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
Yeah.  A real moron.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
Randy's mom said yes right away.
Ten?
Cause I don't even know you.
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
Hello?
No, I need my car --
That's okay.  I understand.
Know what I always thought I wanted outta life, Erin?  A Jaguar.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
What?
You know that thing it says in here about rashes?
It'll be fine, yeah.
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
I feel The Force.
Barks his concern.
... the power?
... Like we're being watched.
Yeah ...
No, no!  I'll stay and help you find your friend.
Because of my father, I guess.
Commander Skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. Maybe he slipped by without checking in.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
Sir, I was wondering ...
I can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
Does Luke know?
Those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... Han, I don't know how ...
Would it help if I got out and pushed?
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
Probably an asteroid field ....
To get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
That Star Destroyer is slowing down.
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Where?
Sharp bank, Chewie.  Let's turn this bucket around.  You heard me, turn around!  Full power on the front shield.
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
What about Han?
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
What?
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Leia ... What would you think if I went away for a while?
This hyperdrive had better work.
I don't believe it.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
You will know.  When you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  A Jedi uses The Force for knowledge and defense.  Never for attack.
Four this time!  The Force you feel.
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
There was a sort of carpetbag in the ship.
I mean he's of your race. He's an Ape.  Look.  You don't have to be afraid.  We've put him in chains and under sedation. Do you understand that?
Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
Who's that?
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
I thought he was, but he came back.
Where's Plissken?
Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Wait a minute. I know that voice.  You're Carjack Malone.
I see your point. What's the favor?
I don't know, sounds thin to me.
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Get this crap out of me.
I guess we have a deal. Nice to be working with you, Plissken.
Locked.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
Location.
Delgado?
Stop the damn car.
No way.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
How do you know all this?
Are you crazy?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Hershe, you were in Cleveland?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
Is he coming?
In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make you a knight. Rise, Sir...
I am King, and this is Excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. Who are you, and why do you block the way?
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Move aside!
Yield. I have the advantage.
But your life and lands are far from here.
Arthur.
You are that and much more. You are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. Now we will be together--
Perceval, you have returned!
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
How? Where?
In the great book.
What book is that?
Who will it be? Put your mind to it, then.
So you were stealing their honey. They should have killed you.
I am alone and betrayed. By my wife, by my beloved friend, by my knights. And by you. Perhaps most of all by you. For you made me, you forged this wretched life. And like a child tired of a toy, you toss me aside, a babbling lecher trotting after my sister...
What is this place, Merlin?
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
Why can't you be my champion?
Why?
The law forbids it.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
You are truly magnificent!
What do you want? You must desire it for me to weave it.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Here.
What's this?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
Phonograph.
Me too.
May I ask...?
Not that I know of.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
Bastard! I will kill you.
Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
She used those words?
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Lesion, Lesion in the temperal lobe. It's a kind of seizure disorder.
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
You could do it yourself...
What else?
There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.
No, is Regan aware of it?
Is she gonna die?
Um........Stuff.
I found it.
You know how?
You really don't want me to play huh?
Captain Howdy.
Well, maybe he's sleeping.
Cause I like it.
I don't know
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
Do you not like him like daddy?
Oh you did. What did you hear?
What goes down there? I mean who's the priest I keep seeing, he's there all the time. He has black hair and he's very intense looking?
Withering Heights.
He broke the bread, gave it to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you and eat. For this is my body." When the supper had ended, he took the cup, again he gave you thanks and praise. Gave the cup to his disciples and said "Take this, all of you will drink from it, this is the cup of blood, the blood of the new and ever lasting covenant and the mystery of faith".
Do it again.
You speak Latin?
What's that?
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No.
No momma.
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
And also with you.
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
William F. Kinderman. Homicide.
Only what I read in the papers.
Sick priest, is that it?
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Yes
Sometimes.
Frankie.
So?
Trunks?
Teeth.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
Tag 'em, Willie.  The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday.  Thanks.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Huh?
So we on tomorrow night?
You're their uncle.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
Only on odd days.
Nice, huh?
No?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
I'll drop the eighths.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
Get out of here!
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Something, huh?  All those bids.
It was April.  April seventeenth. That one I remember.
Have some more wine, Frank.
We're gonna be here a week?
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what?  Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack.  Nobody. So why should you care?
Half-hour.  Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast.  You see what's on the buffet?
He was wearing a suit.
Celebrating.  Join me?
The party's over.
Expensive hangover.
February?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
What?
You don't know?
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
Looks like these got a few years on them.
Oh. Fine.  It was nothing.  Couple sore knuckles.  Nothing.
I mean, you can play.  You're okay.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
We're finished.
You're an hour and a half late.
This is show business?
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
What's the problem?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors?  Okay, remember.  Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
You two could play checkers.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
Baker's unabridged.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
What'd she sing?
Wow. You ever see her again?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Huh?
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Lucky for you.  Well, there you go, guys. Don't spend it all in one place. Oh ... you want to count it, Jack?
Gotta go.
They never do, Mr. Barker.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
Regular hours are eight to five.
Save it.  What's he look like?
No.
It's been a long time, Ma.
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
So why's he do it?
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
History.
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
You can always get another girl.
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Jack.
Let me get the light.
Losing his teeth.
Like clockwork.  You got a good memory, Jackie.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
Why not?
What's a prom?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Sure.
Yes.  Right.  Eddie.  How is he?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
How old is he?
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
Why would he need more?
He's your brother, you figure it out.  Maybe he made another bomb.
That's not the worst part.
For being one helluva guy.
It's important.
... I was dreaming ...
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Were you there to catch me?
I can't tell you ... except only I can do it.
Why point it at me?  I'm the real thing.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Not anymore.
Give up, Castor.  People are going to find out.
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
You'll need to recultivate that virus.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm not going anywhere.
What are you doing?
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
What about me?
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
Do you like kids?
You see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
So could you write down her exact address?
I’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, Arn.
It’s me, Jack...
I don’t care if you’re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
You just said everyone needs something.
What?!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.
But what do I do?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Evelyn, right?
Are we...?
That’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
No, you’re right.  What are we doing?
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Why not?
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
No?
Excuse me?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
I never used to be like this, Kate.  I had it all figured out.  No doubts, no regrets.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
Pretty incredible, isn’t it?
Are you out of your mind?
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
Kate...
Don’t get on that plane!
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
I need you, tiger..
Not by a long shot.
For the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
Okay, I’ll take them...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
You are an amazing lover.  You should be giving motivational seminars.
Isn't that <u>your</u> speech?
I don't know.  I just keep going over and over the numbers.
Reed.  Even <u>you</u> can't compute every little thing.
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
We're working as hard as we can --
Where...where am I?
The machine works.  And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Ben?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
He didn't.
I don't really know.  A compound organic-metallic alloy.  Stronger than titanium or carbon steel.  Harder than diamonds --
But...this disease...is progressive... degenerative...
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
Me like-y.
You're gonna pay for that, Pebbles.  What?!
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Got it.  So take a walk, Ben...I'm going to borrow Susan for a second.
Not until Ben is back inside!
As far as crew, I was hoping Ben could pilot the mission --
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
What are you doing?
Of course.  Of course.
Why didn't you say something?
Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?
What are you doing?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!
The less time, the better.
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
<Combined Miniature Deterrent Forces>.
If the Other Side ever gets hold of a thing like that...
That's right. He wanted us to have the secret, and not them. Which is why they tried to kill him.
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
Yes, we'd like to get moving.
You're going out there? With those Antibodies --
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
If you had a transistor about this size and power output, and a thin enough wire --  -- could you piece it together?
Oh yes, I'm sure Dr. Duval could. If we had the parts.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
But that isn't possible.
I'll do nothing of the sort! The operation is <my> responsibility! I won't do it, and that's final!
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
About forty miles an hour.
In a way -- yes. Those are impurities imbedded in the Lung after a lifetime of 'Civilization.' Carbon from smoke and smog -- specks of dust --
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
May I?
Sort of.
Yes, there is.
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
No Jean, no money!
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
I don't think so. It's nice.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
I'm fuckin' hungry now, you know.
...Look at that. Twin Cities.  IDS Building, the big glass one.  Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest.  After the Sears, uh, Chicago...  You never been to Minneapolis?
Shut the fuck up or I'll throw you back in the trunk, you know.
Yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. I thought Shep told you -
Okay.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
...The heck d'ya mean?
Yah, but that TruCoat -
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
They can really take over, that's for sure.
Oh, don't be silly.
Uh-huh.
So, ya know, he's drinkin', so I don't think a whole great deal of it, but Mrs. Mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought I should call it in, so I called it in. End a story.
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
Mm.
Shep Proudfoot. That's a name.
Yah.
Can you be any more specific?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Uh-huh.
LeSeure. But I went to high school in White Bear Lake.
He was a little older. Looked like the Marlboro man.
I'm talkin' about your potential.
You're not a C student.
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
The financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we don't know is your fee.
They're playin' the Buckeyes!
What if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
Dad, I really think we should call the cops.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
but do you know that for sure without -
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
But I already got the, it's okay, the loans are in place, I already got the, the what, the -
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
Circumstances have changed, Jerry.
Good day, sir.
Yah.
Twice.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Well, you know Stan'll say no dice. That's why you pay him.  I'm asking you here, Wade. This could work out real good for me and Jean and Scotty -
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
Heck, you don't know! You're just whistlin' Dixie here! I'm sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I'm sayin' call a professional!
Dammit! I wanna be a part a this thing!
Well, I don't vouch for him.
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Where is everybody?
Gotta eat a breakfast, Marge.  I'll fix ya some eggs.
...What can I get ya?
I think I remember Linda, yah.  She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
I'm sorry.
Yah, I, uh... She had leukemia, you know...
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
Yes, ma'am. Are we the closest PD?
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
They're real good.
Not on your feet too much?
Hautman's blue-winged teal got the twenty-nine cent. People don't much use the three-cent.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Yeah, both of us.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Whoever set this homemade dynamite could've blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  The gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
No.  No, sir.  I loved that condo. I loved every stick of furniture. The lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  The dishes were me.  The plants were...
Maybe I died already.  Look at my face.
I think testicular cancer should be no contest.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you.  You still have your balls.
I want brain parasites.
That's your favorite, too?  Tried to slip it by me, eh?
I'm just on my way out...
Here.
Answer the question!
Say my name.
Marla... I need to talk to you.  It's going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
I mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  I know this... I know us hasn't been such a great thing for you...
You are an insane person.
Marla...
Let go of me!
Who did this to you?
Tyler?
Uh... I'm sorry.  We met on the plane.  We had the same briefcase. I'm... you know, the clever guy.
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
What?
You buy furniture.  You tell yourself: this is the last sofa I'll ever need.  No matter what else happens, I've got the sofa issue handled.  Then, the right set of dishes.  The right dinette.
There's always that.
No, I...
Why would anyone want this shitty job?
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.
How do you feel?
I know that.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
She is a wild, twisted bitch.  Stay away from that one.
You want to finish her off?
As the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  Remember the crap they taught you in Boy Scouts.
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Six months advance pay.  Six months!
Something on your mind?
Answer me, Tyler.
What are you talking about... ?
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
We're going to have to do something about Marla...
You have jobs.
I can't let you...
I'm going to...
Fuck your struggle.  I want out.
From now on, we'll share Marla. We've been spending too much time apart...
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
I swear on my life, I won't...
What have you left for me?
What?
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Did you hear what I just said?!
We need some towels, Lou.  We need replacement light bulbs.
Would you rather be dead?
I thought...I thought you might be able to help me.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
What do you mean "grand theft auto?" This is insane.
Pigeons... It's a sign!  If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacked by Pigeons!
Turn around.  The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main.
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
Shit, I don't have her number.  She was never interviewed.  She took off right after the accident.
How do you know?
But it's over.  Isabella's baby was the key.  You saw her die and everything, right?
I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile- up.
Can I ask you a question?
Mom?
Most kids do, I guess.
Police are coming.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
You're the fuckin' devil.
His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps.  And no... escapes.
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
Co Phuong Bao.  The guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at Ban... at Ban... Bo Peep.  Shit!
No radio source.  Nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
Show me how it operates.
What's this stuff on the rice?
How you doing, Brewer?
Alright.  Home run.
You comin'?
Why's that?
Intelligence work.
Why'd they want us?
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
What was that?
John.  My name is John.
Stay on your heading, Captain.
What's the job?
What's the plan?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Christ almighty.
How long have you been setting up?
About 22 hours on site.
Look, it was a screw-up, alright? They weren't supposed to find anything.  We thought that camp was empty.
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
Man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
Yep! Right on it!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
I tell you something, Anne.  I really feel like I'm cursed.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
You're kidding!  What did he say?
What?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
What if I was a relative?
I think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when I call she's never home... But I think we'll go out this weekend... I've...
Can I help you?
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Well there....  What's the difference?
So how do we do this?
Have I died?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
<u>What</u>?!
Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Here's another twenty. Will that do?  I mean, what's it going to take!
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
The Red Knight!
Who?
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Happily married, probably.
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited.  You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
Beautiful night huh?
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
You just going to sit there?
I know you're not.
I'm sorry.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Bobby...
No. How much do I owe you?
But I can't have any. Is that what you mean?
You always do this to me.
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Who's Van Oost?
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Crashes into a Jeep and totals his neck.  That's Carl...
Robert, I have to tell you something...
How long have you been staying here?
Uhm hmm. Some range.
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it...  Do you think I'm a freak?
You're attractive, Tita. If you just did a little more with yourself...
Where's Catherine?!
Bye, now.
What?
Catherine...
You think I'm a fake.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
Yes.
I hope I didn't hear that.
Come on, Terry, we got a ride!
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
Hi.
Just chill.
So what you think of me?
You look good.
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
What are you going that way for?
Which one?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
How old is he?
A girl named Amanda.
She's like this high, dark hair, skinny
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
No.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I wasn't asking.
They didn't do anything.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
Really. The California Racquet Club?
Yes.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
That's Babar.
But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
Well, which one?
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
Just relax....
I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
Like tonight.
For sure?
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
Noooo. Free snort. That's it.
Are you all right, Doctor?
Where am I?
Well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  Wait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles. Tissue was benign.
That's it?
Until she remarries, Fletch.
You may be right.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Ten days ago?
I really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?
John Ultramalensky, right?
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
What?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Yeah. Maybe.
I want you to come to my house. Then we'll talk.
I think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Wouldn't they normally be locked?
So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
Can I steal you for a minute?
My hero.
We used to fly together. I'm... John.
You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?
I have this effect on lots of women.
You are a rich woman.
Who is it?
All this goes on Underhill's bill?
Can I ask you a question?
Because I'm bored. Oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. I'm sorry. If it makes you feel any better, I also let you in because I'm hungry.
What about his parents?
I think you should call me Gail, now.
What are you talking about?
I was afraid you'd say that.
I recommend it.
No wonder.
I'm calling the cops. This is for the cops.
I'm her cousin.
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
You're onto something. That's good. What?
What about finding the source?
I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me.
I'm sick of this place. I'm going to try out for the Lakers. They need a power forward.
Jim Swarthout?
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
Nonsense.  After what you've been through, it sounds like I owe you.
Did she tell you anything?
What cheap shit... hey, waiter!
Your tip paid off.  Jazz, this is Sam the Sleazebag.  Sam the Sleazebag, this is Jazz, my secretary.
You wish.
I do it for love.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
You okay?
Hah fluck, great video, huh?
Who do you think you are, Ford? The tooth fairy.  Kill!  Kill!  Kill!
Fuck that, I mean, the heck with that.  I kicked their ass!  Well, I tried.  There were two of them you know...
You think you're so hot just because you can get into any club. You think you're so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  You think you're so hot just because you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
Polo.
Fine!
I'm off it!
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
How's it going?
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Yeah, I did, you condescending fuck, but I miss Snoopy coming out at the end.  Isn't your enjoyment impaired?
Shit.
Maybe later, but first I want like to know why you'd steal from your own company...
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
You don't use shit?
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Sal --
What?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Man, I'm clean.
Who's this --
Look, Mr. Charnier, you got to be reasonable.
It's your problem.
He is not wrong.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
A piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
Never trust a nigger.
Come on -- one drink.  Whatta you say?
Drink this.
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Give who a tail?
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
Hey, Bo.
Where'd you get this fag shit?
Pass.
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
It was a crematorium.
Yeah.
Switches are shorted out.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
I love you, Bud.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I've been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the HAM...and, uh, he...
I'm serious.
Frank, we need to talk...
How's that?
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
29 years...?
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
You sound...ground up...?
Dad...?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
Something happened, something...
Dad, we did something.  Something to make it worse.
Whatta you mean...
I'll warn them.
What do I tell them?
It's okay.  This is working.  This is gonna work.
I'm right here, Dad.
I don't think I can.  I'm not a cop.  I can't.   I can't stop this guy.
But we can, we can do it together. Spirit and guts, remember?
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
His prints.  You've got his prints.  I'll run them through criminal index.  You gotta get me that wallet.
How the hell am I gonna do that?
Huh?
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
Fine.  You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
Yeah...I remember.  I used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom wouldn't let me have a toy gun.
Wife around?
The 2-3.  Homicide.
Huh.
Who the fuck is this?
Sullivan?
Where are you going?
What is that?
No more... I can't!
What're you doing?
How about you and I whacking a couple of balls around?
How do we do it?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
It's dark down there.
Let's spread out and check all the rooms.  Outside, too.  You stay with me.
Why did you come back here?
Everything's gonna be fine.
Bullseye!
If this thing is burned out, friggin' Horace will ground my butt.
What?
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
....with a woman's touch.
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
My ass.
Come on, Dad.  You could have Rick drive down Cunningham Road and look for them.
Jason who?
But, Dad, we...
When are you going to stop treating me like one!
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Uh...yes.  But...
Whew...Okay, hand me those padlocks.
Are they grown-ups?
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Steven...
I know who you are.
No, I --
Twenty.
Look --
What do you want?
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
For a good reason.
She's beautiful.
Why didn't you tell me?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Are you crazy?!
Look, I know I treated her bad --
Never.
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
What's going on? I heard on the P.A. system that...
Have you seen Tamara?
I hear the crew members are cute guys in their twenties.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
What are you going to do?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
But I thought...
Christ...where's Rennie??
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
Rennie -- I was just on my way over to your room
So, are you having fun yet?
Hi, Sean.
I got you a present.
I thought maybe we could hike to the top of the Statue when we got there, if you felt like it. It's supposed to be 22 stories tall.
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
Can he really take us home?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Press a button and they give us money.
Asbestos lining.
What do I exude?
Tonight. What's tonight?
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Do you want me to tell you what it was like, reading that review at the newstand with trucks rumbling past and street vendors facing Mecca?
You say we go?
The man has taken over my mind. He's not only out there. He's in my head and I can't get rid of him. I can't write a word without imagining his response. I'm paralyzed as an artist.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
Great game.
This could be it.
You know about Adele.
What about her?
She died.
Our Peter?
Can he get through it?
We're able to surprise each other.
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
That's completely crazy.
Opening night?
What will we talk about?
What else?
Yes.
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
It's your best play, Nicky.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
Life is good.
People are dependable.
What did it say?
If it's you, what are you doing here?
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
They're only gonna lose.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
My back is killing me.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
This is something no one has been privileged to see in almost seventy years. Very few people now alive can say that they have seen what you are about to see, Matthew. The Red Sox win a World Series. This is deeply, intensely personal. All the mistakes I've made, all the envy, fear and violence that's encased in this little envelope we call a person -- all washed away in the next few minutes. And your grandmother knows why.
They're my team.
hat was this morning.
I have excellent long-term memory.
You have to see the words. Try to build a mental picture of the script. Imagine your lines high- lighted with a felt tip pen.
What was your favorite color crayon, growing up?
I kissed her while she was laughing.
Yes.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I don't know.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
Not quite. They're only "holding me" until the Magistrate's hearing. Then it will be prison.
Back in South Africa...  long time ago.
Tell me -- do you think about hell?
You will respect the law.
Is it over if they arrest you now?
It has. But you'd be surprised. They understand -- they really do. It's not the workers you have to worry about.
I will not sit by to see the mastery of the British replaced by the mastery of the Hindus!
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
I'm -- I'm afraid I have no money.
How much extra?
I guess I'm a slow learner.
A man's dead, Detective.
What a pity.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
What are you waiting for?
Where do we start?
We believe we have a suspect.
Good to see you're feeling better.
You okay, Jerome?
I think I'd better choose the menu.  After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
You had to be a right-hander.
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
A day or so.
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Where?
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  How could you be so careless?
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
Not thirsty?  We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
Anything I've forgotten?
Vincent...Vincent...
I'd have to bleach my hair.
No bother.
So you didn't do it after all.
There's a problem, Lamar.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I'm in a hurry.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
A simple reason, McCoy. The obvious reason. To rob a bank.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Hello, Doc.
What do you mean? You've never been there.
I've been doing my homework.
You been okay?
Fatter... some things never change.
$250,000 right off the top.
Is he straight?
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
It doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, Doc.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
I don't want to go there.
You're full of ifs.
From now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
Only one car.
Where are you going?
Are you hungry?
No scars?
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.
We're going to make it.
Ten. Laughlin's going to take us across at four A.M.
Yeah.
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
You wouldn't be taking the train to Salt Lake, would you?
No, I'm afraid not.
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Gonna knock down a wall?
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.
Where?
How's Mama and the kids?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
He took the day off.
Just fine.
Let's just get to the border.
Listen... how much money did you make this year?
And I keep my mouth shut?
You do what he says, Harold.
How long have you been married?
I got a nurse in mind.
Hello, Jack,  I don't know anything, Jack.
Did Eric Pake pull her?
When did you find out?
Who?
This is my brother's car.
Oh ay?
He was drunk. Drunk as a lord.
A new venture of mine. It's going to be a restaurant.  Do you like it?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
Really.
Though nicer than most?
Once a week you like a gentleman?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Really?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
Entertaining.
Does Brumby get a kick out of that crap?
Expect so.
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
Have another?
Wilton Estate.
Come off it. Frank was... well... straight. He had no worries I know. Hell, we worked together every day for a year. It would have showed.
It just would. He was always the same.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Get knotted.
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Ta.
They came back?
You're lucky. They kill as well.
Pension him off.
You wouldn't.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
No.
You must be joking. I never eat breakfast,  Did you sleep well?
Not much.
And that'll make me feel better?
What you going to do?
No, I didn't know that.
A bereavement. A death in the family.
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Still got a sense of humour?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Scotch, please.
Gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
They do that up North.
Mmm...
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
They killed the goose.
It is.
Eh?
It's too...
I, I...I...
Eh?
Yes.
Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  You see?  That's thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  What are we giving ninety per...for nothing. For some jerk sit in the office tell you "Get out there and close." "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He goes out and buys.  He pays top dollar for the... you see?
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
So Graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
He's doing very well.
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should stand up and strike back.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Yes.
You didn't?
No.  Not actually.
You're going to steal the leads?
I...
...and rob the place...
Well, to the law, you're an accessory.  Before the fact.
Why?  Why, because you only told me about it?
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
He said he filed...
...what am I going to do all month...
Yeah.
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
A waste of time?  Why?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
No.
Where were you?
Where was I?
Was I?
Thieves.
Did they...?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
That they're going to be upset.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Would you excuse us, please...?
Aaronow...
Shelly...
Murray...
Let me tell you something, Shelly. I do what I'm hired to do. I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to watch the leads.  I'm given...hold on, I'm given a policy.  My job is to do that.  What I'm told.  That's it.  You, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark I'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
I'm out.
Why?
The leads are assigned randomly...
What are we going to say?
What happened?
Look: I have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, I'm trying to make some sense...
No.  It hadn't.
What'd you do with the leads?  You want to go in there?  I tell him what I know, he's going to dig up something...You got an alibi last night?  You better have one. What did you do with the leads?  If you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
What?
The check's no good?
Their check's no good?  They're nuts...?
Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any case...This whole goddamn...
They took the phones...
"Always be closing..."
That's what I'm saying.  The old ways.  The old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...I say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. I plat it out eight units.  Eighty- two grand.  I tell them. "This is now.  This is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  This is it, Harriett..."
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
Oh!  For the magazine...
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
Yes.
Yest...
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I told you.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
I'm...
I...
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What are the police doing?
You cashed the check?
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
You going to turn State's?
Guess what the Machine did?
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
They didn't get my contracts.
Did they...
They took some of the con...
I have the stuff from last year's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
...Mr. Williamson...
Will you take me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
I want to talk to you, Michael.
Would you like some?
You would risk your life for strangers?
The child cannot harm you.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
Mike, I got something special up my sleeve for these boys.  You ever hear of &quot;Superman?&quot; And I don't mean the comic book.
No.  I mean, are you sure?
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever.
I didn't know it was a hit.  I swear to you I didn't know.  Johnny Ola contacted me in Beverly Hills -- said he wanted to talk.  He said you and Roth were in on some big deal, and there was a place for me in it if I could help them out. They said you were being tough on the negotiation, and if they had a little bit of help, they could close it fast and it would be good for you.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
Hello?
What was it, so I'll know.
Wait... there's something else.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
What's up?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.
Do you gamble?
Senator Kane.
This meeting is adjourned.
I'm going to the market.
His brother came to help him.
You would have killed his brother?
How can I let you leave; how can I let you take my children away? Don't you know me?  You understand, it's an impossibility.  I would never let it happen; no, never, not if it took all my strength, all my cunning.  But in time, soon, you'll feel differently.  You see, you'll be happy that I stopped you.  I know you.  You'll forget about this; you'll forget about the baby we lost... and we'll go on, you and I.
The baby I lost...
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you?
I deny his every charge.
I know.
Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast.
I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them.
I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home?
I want you to help me take my revenge.
We'll try.
Rosato, where's your brother?
You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk.
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you.
What's this?
I accept your generosity...
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Hey, no strings, right?  That's what you always said.  Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
I didn't mean to...
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
You will not hurt him?
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
That is why he must go to hell.  I do not think it fair.  But God's law is not for us to judge.
We have his note.
My name is Whale.  This is my house.
What?  Oh yes.
They're just copies then.  Gotcha.
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
What was wrong?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Football in college.
You went to university?
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
I'm not wearing an undershirt.
I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
Ah.  A philosopher.
What happened?
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Is that really her?
Ten minutes ago.  Didn't you hear me calling?
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
Never gave it much thought.
Do you mind?
You didn't, Jimmy.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to.  You'll be fine on your own?
Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there?
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
My God.  Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair?  I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
She is horrible.
I have my family.  Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
No.  I expect you can't.
Sure.
It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play?
You're serious.
Quite.
Of course.
Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?
Who was the job for?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
They gave you only four days?
Well, now, he's clear. And you'll stay away from him...
Well, that certainly won't do.
You know my back -
How's Atley -- ?
You ever feel bad about any of this?
For real. Okay. Gimme COLUMBO...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
That's a good one, Donny...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
okay, sir. Let me just get the-order. Yes. We'll be doing some work out your way. We've got a power leak. And it's unsafe. We're moving residences to the... Marriott Long Beach ... Just for the night ...
You guys are through...
Sure -
No...
Yeah -
You're kind of cultivating a new look.
I can handle it --
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
You hear me?
How long were you gonna let me try and stop it...?
The family that steals together, deals together...
What era was that -- ?
Nah.
What are you doing here?
Now what -- ?
Call 911 -
"Mitch?"
Six or seven...
Right. Great car. One of a kind. I was looking forward to that boost myself
Very good...
Cos there were those dark days, when I figured - my God, how easy it was for him to just give it up; to make the deal; take the rot for the whole crew ... And give me up in the process.
What the hell's that -- ?
"Unlock my button" ... ?
Woo-woo-wooooo!
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
What about The Club ... ?
How is he -- ?
What are you doing... ?
This time it's for real?
Tell me...
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Who's "Eleanor?"
So she flies -
So what's in there -- ?
Uh ... Randall -- ?
Why don't you leave him alone?
Which way's out, man -- ?
You think I don't know? You think I like to keep this inside? But I gotta, or he'll kill the miserable bastard and he'll be there for life. It's disgusting what you have to put up with.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Tell him. It's okay.
The guy from near where Christie used to live?
Wha?  Me?
Anybody!  You understand?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Go inside. I'll be right there.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
What are you talking about?
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke.  I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Yes, you can. I've got it set up. We'll be fine. All I need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I've got a guy in here from Pittsburgh who'll move it for me. Believe me, in a month we'll be fine. We won't need anybody.
I flushed it down the toilet.
It's still better than letting somebody find him.
Paulie's gonna make him?
Yeah.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
He heard.
What happened to you?
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
We'll pack up everything and send it to you.
I got dry cleaning.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
If you knew those fucking kids. They're nuts. Especially that Tommy. What am I going to do with them?
But, Paulie, please.
Someday they'll get what's coming to them. That's the only way they'll stop.
You want a partner?
What do I look like, Al Cowlins?  You want to take my car, drop her off?
She went to Medical school in California.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
You and Morgan throw?
You're kiddin' me.
Okay.
Ah, history I think.
She'll live.  If she starts yelling again I might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
--That isn't funny--
Come on, Will...
Did your Uncle get arrested?
It's a good thing no one's Irish here.
What's up guys?
I'm not sure--
Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms--
Somethin's in my room.
You're in a safe place, Will.
Alexander, I know your theory. The boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
No, there's a limit.
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
Hey fuck you.
What's that?
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
Will.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
Sean.
Hello.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Gerry! Any trouble finding the place?
You're here quite a bit, then.
This is a disaster! I brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
He has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. And you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
That's right! You were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! So don't blame me for how your life turned out. It's not my fault.
Sean...
I don't know. India maybe.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
I got one of those too.
What do you want to do?
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here when we're all wrecked. What's she gonna think about us?
C'mon, I read your book. I talked to you. It's just something I know to be true.
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Look, man. I don't care if you're putting from the rough. There are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; Alexander the Great, Caeser, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Napoleon, Gertrude Stein, not to mention Danny Terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
The color here, see how dark it is? It's interesting.
I was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. I stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and I fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. You know what occurred to me?
Yeah, I went on a date last week.
Why not?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
No, I don't.
I gave that up when my wife got sick.
October 21, 1975. Game six of the World Series. Biggest game in Red Sox history, Me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. We were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. What a game that was. Tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps Carlton Fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. Thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. Fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. It hits the foul pole, home run. Thirty-five thousand people went crazy. And I wasn't one of them.
That's right.
I guess.
Do you have a soul-mate?
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
Oh, what? You're going to take the professor's side on this?
It's not your fault.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
I bet you have a great family.
You know, nothing special.
Yeah.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Exactly.
How's it goin'?
Just for fun?
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
At least you have a mother.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
Twenty days work, oh boy!
Go on. Get in your tent. You don't know nothin'.
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
Ready, Ma?
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe *no* days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
Naw. They paroled me.
Lots must a died, too.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
I guess that's what he looked like.
I didn't see nothin'.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Two.
Kids?
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
We'll work it out. What's this committee you talkin' about?
We got five sanitary units. Each one elects a central committee man. They make the laws, an' what they say goes.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Yeah. On my way home now.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
This is Muley Graves.  You remember the preacher, don't you?
Think she'll hold?
We ain't campin'. We jus' stoppin' a minute--
Yeah.
Get to what?
Well, fi' cents a box ain't much, but a fella can eat.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
You take this.  I ain't hungry.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n--  --I'll do it.
Pa! Shh!
Thank God. Oh thank God.  Tommy, you didn't *bust* out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Don't taste bad.
Yes'm, that was it.
No.
Was Granma bad?
When?
I'm sorry, Ma. But--I didn't know what I was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. I didn't even know I was gonna do it.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Yeah?
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can have this for ten cents.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
Not be so lonesome, either, knowin' his name is there with 'im, not just' a old fella lonesome underground.
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
You people looking for work?
Mister, we're lookin' even under boards for work.
Yeah...
You're so funny...
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Bob. Bob Destephano.
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Yes.
Tell me about yourself.
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
That's part of it.
Bad television.
Which would you rather...?
Is it something you've done?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
Come on.
How do you know?
You know where I live?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
What do you want?
There you go. I left it blank.
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
It was the PLO.
Wait a minute--
If he does our job, he's our job.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Enough?
It's a place where religious people--
I think I'll go see Debi today.
That's too bad.
Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Does Chicago count?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Yeah.
I am comfortable.
The point was to love each other.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
What about him?
Whatever you want.
That's not true!
Grace, I don't hate your father.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
David?
Did you speak to Farlow?
Hi.
That bag's almost empty.
I'm sorry.
Doing what?
Yeah.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
May I have a suggestion?
Take your time.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
She calls him Tommy...
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
I understand, but Annie, please...
Mixed salad.
Sure. As long as she don't mind.
That's what some folks say.
Now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
Sure?
I can't believe it's the same horse.
Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
You ever miss it?
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Record the tones that the coins make. And hang up and get your money back!
Active matrix, man. A million psychedelic colors. Man, baby, sweet, ooo!
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Dead?
Dade?
Yeah, mom?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
No. No one special.
Loser.  I can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. It's quite an impressive virus. Dade, I know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. For us, there's no such thing as family and friends. We're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I'd like to make a treaty with you.
How did you know that?
Your slave?
Thank you.
I know, I know who wrote it.
Norman? This is Mr. Eddie Vedder, from Accounting. I just had a power surge here at home that wiped out a file I was working on. Listen, I'm in big trouble, do you know anything about computers?
Homicidal?
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
Mr. Belford?
Anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I'm in this computer right? So I'm looking around...
You guys always think I should know everything, and you never tell me anything. Am I right?
Nono, it's like hot or something. I don't know.
What?
Real charmer.
Rachel, I've got an expl-- I've got an explanation.
Who's that?
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Well tonight is very important for your father and me.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
Honey, I don't think their home.
We should call the fire department.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
Who you calling?
Got it Earl.
Do you love me Rachel?
Like a sister?
But you wanted to go out tonight. It's my fault that you can't.
What are you doing out here alone?
We'll hear sirens soon.
Dad, what's going on?
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
Where are you going?
You got your riot gun?
I am. Ben Meeker.
He's here, Sheriff.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
It isn't a man.
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Car trouble?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Sheriff, what is going on out there?
What happened?
Well, are we still on for tonight?
What time?
I don't see anything.
Hello?
I thought it was an obscene phone call.
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
I've already lost it.
You still spooked?
Mister Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mister Riddle is eighty-seven.
What's the pumpkin for?
Thanks.
What's this big, big news?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I can't.
Get him out of here!
I can't help it. It just keeps ringing.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
You all right?
Sure...
I found the car! He's here!
Nothing. I was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
Okay. Later.
Why are they under there?
What about the bogyman?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
No...
There WAS.
What did he look like?
How?
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
He asked me if I could help him find his purple lawnmower.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Well, I live downtown.
Uh...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
You're joking.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
And you, you-you're going?
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Could you--
Read the papers!  Half the country's doing it!
How about you?
Oh, book?  Oh, no, I...  I'm killing time.  I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
But not over me?
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
No.
I know.
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
Where're you going?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Why not?
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
I want one with you.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Are you?
Yeah.
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
How about something to eat?
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
Oh, great.
No.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
Really?
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Yeah?  Yeah?  Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
...you know?  I, uh...
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
What are you talking about?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Okay.
Ouch!
Really?
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Awwww...
You're too demanding.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  I can't hear anything.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't...
Yeah.  Me, too.
Yeah, it was.
People change...you know.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
So how are you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
To <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  What one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
It wasn't my day.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
It's a growth business.
Yes?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
Bad beat today.
You want to get married...?
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
Well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
What's new onna street?
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
He had nothing.  He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he...
They got that kind of money?
You take this much time over everything?
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
...thank you...  And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you're awake...
Try Barney Clark.
...here's to child abuse!
Let the girl go.
Why?
Shut up, Starling...
Starling...?
I don't <u>think</u> so...
Waal...
Waited too long, hon...?  
Give it up, Evelda.
A wonderful country...
...should love to correct your error. 
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Who does not?
...who say...?
Make them eat the figurine.
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
What is that that smells so wonderful.
...I'm sorry....?
The girl needs help.
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
Fine, thank you, but
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
I am on the track of...
No.  Invite us?  No, he simply...
Then we cannot go.
Because...?
I know where he is.
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
Yes.
I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
What's wrong with approval?  You admired that man.
I want to do something <u>positive</u>...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Why are you being so grouchy--This is an important night for us...
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Mine!
Hey, it's not a crush anymore if                            ] you actually say it to the person                           ] you supposedly have the...                                  ] ] JASPER                                             ] Thought I'd get points for a post-                          ] modern approach to coming on to you.                        ]
That would be a No.
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
Oh you know, Bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Do you really not believe in God?
When were you in Niagara Falls?
Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
I don't believe it. I'm winning.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
All right.
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
No.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
I guess I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
Oh.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
Did to.
Catch a movie? Miniature Golf?
Let's kick his ass.
We on tonight man?
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
But my name's not...
Stained with loserness. Oh, I like it. Can I use that. It'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck cheek.
wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and Juliet.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
hurries over.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
What?
John has fallen in love with me!
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
Bye, Dad.
Isn't it beautiful!
These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
I have my connections
I've been in here before.
That was cold...
Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction.
OH MY GOD TREVOR! It hurts!!  oh my God, Oh my God. Trevor, It's coming out.
But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet
What evidence?
Ambulance.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh?
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.
Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
I don't recall saying I didn't want a million bucks...
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
You got those people out of the plane, LaPlante, not me.
There was this kid there saying, "Go in there and save my father, mister." And I'm thinking about my boy Joey and this goddamn fireman my wife's seeing. It was like I was supposed to save myself.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Hey!  Do I have a record?  Have I ever done time?  I mean I been arrested a few times, who hasn't? Parking tickets for Chrissake! Suspicion of stuff!  Have I ever been convicted of anything?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
"Elliot"?  The heroic goddamn fireman?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
Underbelly!
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Sometimes.  His name's Elliot.  He saved a guy's life one time.  In a fire.
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
What picture?
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
I... no... I don't have the right... I...
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?
This guy LaPlante won an award?
Swiped your purse!  While he was saving you?  You gotta be kidding!
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
She's flying to New York.  She's been nominated for a Silver Mike...
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Oh my God!  Bernie!
Never reach out!
We're from Channel Four, yes.  We'd like to find --
There's no face really, nothing to work with.  Big dots, that's all you'll get.
Who?
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Safety?
Where are these toys of yours?
Any particular brand?
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
No, no, no, no.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
It's nice that you can make that choice.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
And?
Neil, you could have burned the house down!
Neil -- what --
Honey --
Honey, do you want some hot chocolate?
Neil, don't leave the back doors open -- I don't want Holly near the pool.
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
<u>Now</u>, Neil.  Stop teasing your sister.
Did you hear that?
He made, you know, a remark.
Well, did he hear anything about your prospects for the new job?
Do you remember who gave us this?
No.
I hear things in this house,
All new houses have noises.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Sweetheart, this is a very risky time for me right now.  Maybe you don't appreciate that.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Who told you that -- someone on the radio?
Philip!  The senior partner?
His secretary just confirmed.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
Who was that?
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
Because it caught my eye when it was in a higher price bracket in the listings.
Shit!
Dad, we can't decide unless Rudolf gets to look too!
Hiya, sport.  Where'd you come from, huh?
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.
And this -- is the master bedroom.
Even cosier.
I'd like that.
No joke, Lieutenant.
They appear to be authentic.
You didn't see this.  Understand?
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?
Tough.
Detective Bedsoe.
Doesn't it scare you walk through the park at night?
She was a good woman.
Yes -- I think it is.
You?
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Who are you?
That's all?
For being a friend when I needed one. I hope our paths cross again.
What worries you?
That doesn't matter.
Agreed.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Leaving?  For how long?
This is.  Go home.  Stay out of this.
Where did you get it?
I'll be fine.
Who was that man last night?
Why?
How could they get by him?
You know it's not safe here for you.
I love you, Conner.
Why?
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.
What, he's cute?  That's his idea of humor?
Jen?  Are you all right?
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Then we might as well die rich.
We're cool.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
Talley?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
You're a funny guy, Talley.
I'd be trying to get the best deal that I could.
He needs a doctor.
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
You got something to say?
<u>Shit</u>!  That <u>fuck</u>!  Even when I want to turn myself in he screws it up!  Did he take the kids with him?
Keeps to himself, more like.
It won't be a problem.
What do you want?
Take it easy.  Just take it easy.  We're here to do business.
I gave the other one to the Sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> FBI.  This one's a fake.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Want one?
Whatever.
I can't go without Thomas.
All three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
That's not enough.
Chief?  Mike said a young girl answered the door.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Jesus Christ, Louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  Put a unit out there.
I know the one.
She didn't answer.
What's wrong with the radio?
Looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
Is my daddy okay?
Okay.
I can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
Who is it?
What do you want?
Paul!
Who are you?
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
I used to work at the Diplomat.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.
Why not? These are not rebels, look at them. Soon they will be worthless to you. Why not take some money, for your work?
Give me it.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
“Well rewarded” Those were his words.
You said you had no whiskey.
General, sir. I am glad to find you. I have found you some supplies.
How so.
You think they will believe you?
You will tell them the truth.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
What do you mean George?
Their money is no good to them. Soon all the Ineysi will be dead.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
The news room has heard that the French and the Belgians are putting together an intervention force.
Mr. Manager.
For supplies, you drive.
Are you sure this is the river road?
Perfect timing.
Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
What do you want?
Was there blood?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
Your brother's here?
Thomas wants advice?
I couldn't help.
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
This won't do.
They are being evacuated.
Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
I have to go out to get food.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
A Volkswagen.
I will not leave without the twins.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You are safe there.
Where has all our beer gone?
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Excuse me?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
Is she...alright?
Most fun I've had all day.
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Could we have a word?
Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
You're hurting me.
Huh. And here I had a completely different theory.
And where are we off to, Mr. Price? Check the wiring on the animatronic Mummies?
Asking the wrong person again.
Steven --
No, no, it's just --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Sources have told this reporter that the real reason your Park's opening has been delayed was a near-fatal accident on one of the rides here. Comment?
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow.
I think...I may have the answer.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
-- hey! --
Damn it.
How did you meet Dr. Shea?
Where does this amulet come from?
What do these ingredients mean?
Can I do it again tonight?
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
Where are we going to go, mommy?
She's here.
Sure.  Did you see the others?
What will Aubrey think?
Well maybe we don't need to remind her of it.  She has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
You don't think I know?
Do you think I'm a fool?
What's going to happen?
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
What?
I know what I saw.
I like you, Joey.  You ask all the right questions.  There is something we can do but it will require great courage.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean ... tonight?
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Wait.  Wait.  The chains.  Where did the chains come from?
Right ... That's ... er ... that's nice of you, Terri.  Can I ask?  Is it always this ... exploratory?
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Buying some drugs, alright?
Can we see?
Welcome. 38
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
I'm sorry.
Wow.  Thank you.
What ... What ... ?
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
You see, we're not so dissimilar.
But how in God's name ...
You're apologizing?
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Oh thank God, you're dead...
That's your definition of "Hard?"
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's.  Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino.  What the hell's a Nintendo?
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
Cameras?
"He can't write his name or read a book.  To fool people is his only thought."
Okay, you got me, Mr. PBS.
That was close....
Let's just forget it, I mean...
My life is not some deal.  I...
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
A little petting is not the issue!
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Hudson, don't you understand...
And you, Dr. Cappucino, you're lucky I don't hit women, assuming you are a woman.  I'm not taking anything for granted anymore.
I-work-for-a-covert-Vatican-humanitarian- organization.  The-CIA-made-a-fool-of-me. I-care-for-you...
Oh Hudson...
Have a seat.  Good to see you, buddy ol' pal...
What else do you got under there ... I don't want to be rude, but this is all pretty lame.
Get away from there, convict!
Don't be stupid...they...
The Hudswinger!
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
About seven minutes.
He didn't offer you money.
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
...What happened?
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
You mean you know about this?
Now, Amy --
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
Sez who?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Tell me about it.
I --
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
Oh, geez.
Well, frankly, I...
...Who let you in?
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him.  ...Make it fast, make it fast.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
She finds him.
...and awduhs a light lunch.
Maybe he's wise.
...adenoids.
She isn't!
Good morning, miss.
What do you mean -- "doctors that are people"?
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
At the Houmfort.
Alive?
But, Mrs. Rand --
Mrs. Rand...
I've worked with it.  I've seen cures. It is at least a hope.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Why?  Everybody else knows it. Paul saw to that.  Sometimes I think he planned the whole thing from the beginning -- just to watch me squirm.
She's dead.  The dead ought to be buried.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
Surely nurses aren't afraid of the dark?
I heard you playing.
Why did you come in here?
Help me? How?
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
So early?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
Yikes -- I was hoping to wear this thing to the Halford's Friday.
What's on your mind? Don't --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
This just isn't the best moment for this.
Ready to go?
All right.
Good.
Fine.
Listen, Benjamin Hood. I have obligations that precede your... from before you showed up. One or two, you know, good-natured encounters, that doesn't mean I'm... I'm not just some toy for you. When I remembered some chores I wanted to get done before the party, I just did them, that's all, because I wanted to do them before I saw Jimmy.
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
It's not the taxes I object to. It's all the fines and penalties.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
You want coffee or something?
That's fine. I wouldn't expect you to see it any other way.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Mikey Williams?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
It's not a bother.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Major.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Why are you so good at math but not in English?
It's freezing.
I don't ever want to see you.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
And?
All my model planes.
I have to go to the bathroom.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Who's that?
I don't remember.
I know.
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
She flattered me about my writing.  Asked if she could visit me.  To talk about my books.
Eight years.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
It was like some big fucking secret!
I'm sorry?
Oh?
Surely you know the one who made you...
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
Then God does not exist...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
No, my beloved, my child.
You said there were none.
I knew. I rescued you, didn't I? From the terrible dawn.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
Does it?
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Laudanum!
Louis, put me in my coffin...
Lestat. Oh, God forgive us.
Don't mock, Claudia...
Louis, look at me.
Claudia, you torture yourself.
You know her?
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
But if she dies...
You let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. We'll start with him.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You really want to be with them?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
What have I done?
What are you saying?
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
You followed me here, didn't you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
How could I not? She had to know.
Yes...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
No.
Karla! Did you tell him I'd be here?
Okay, okay. You're right.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
Yes.
Nice move.
You're okay. Thank god.
Ray, I can't...
I'm fine.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
What if I don't have anything happy from childhood...Sorry, I can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  Which is over seven hundred feet a second. Imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks. You can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. Planes use O-rings...which freeze in tap water. Planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
Julie? What's wrong?
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Pretty cool bar.
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
Oh, look. Another day in paradise with Julie-your-tour-director...Miss Psychotic Episode.
Ahh, that feels great.
How's Julie?
Why? He can't help us.
How much?
Must have missed the sign.
You don't have to. It's inside of you -- all the glory that was Greece -— the dancing, the singing and the white marble --
This was the temple of Hades --the God of the Dead. It contained no images -- just empty space and walls of perfect symmetry.
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
) You feel the symptoms?
The enemy is in retreat. There will be no more fighting here.  I came here to visit the crypts. My wife was buried here. What happened to the bodies?
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
There's no reason to decide any of us are going to die.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
I felt he did not like me.
Miss Wollsten!
You were father's secretary -— I never thought - -
What if he is?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
Really, this is idiotic!
Yes?
What is her illness?
How did she die?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Let me tell him. When he knows you are his child, he'll forget these insane notions -—
But they're somebody's children.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.
Know you? Are you kiddin'? I've been looking all over town trying to find you. I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe . . . Hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
What'd you say?
What did you say?
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
No.
What?
She's . . .
What did you stop it for?
You sent for me, sir?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . And I ain't never seen you before in my life.
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Sure –– Sam Wainwright.
George! George!
You're not paid to be a canary.
You want a martini?
Okay –– all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Hello, George, how are you?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Nothing.
George, can I see you for a second?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Why didn't you call me?
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Now look, did you buy anything?
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
That so? Well, I'll tell him. Hey, that sounds great! Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through. Now, here's the point. Mary, Mary, you're in on this too. Now listen. Have you got any money?
Well, I don't.
You may kiss my hand.
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Tuesday.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Where's your coat and hat?
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Where're you going?
How fast does this go?
You can?
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
Bring her to port a little.  That's it -- steady.
Why not?
Your dad must be really pissed.
Where're we going?
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Loser sails home alone.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
I just made it up.  It means, "Get me out of there."  What the hell's that?
We got a helluva tide this month.
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
Every day?
Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh?  We've had a lot of trouble.
I passed out, but I'm okay.
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
Too late, it's written.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The Shark's mouth.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
Do you?
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat   He's another one.
No.
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
No sweat.  A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that?  Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it.  Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
They have no right to treat you like that.  You've given them every- thing.  For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
What're you going to do today?
I'll give notice.
Hello, hello.  It went well, I thought.
Of course.  Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
I know, I know....
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
What am I, an ass?  When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
That's a crock of shit.
By 7:46, when the tide turns around, we'll be twenty miles out.  More, with this wind.
They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
But first, a little juice....
Be careful....
Power line.
Too hot tor those two?  I can't believe it.
It'll be fun, come on!
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
Uh.  Well.  Maybe you could give Polo a hand going in....
Heading back?
When are we going out?  You and me?
Who wouldn't.
You always go with Andy.
You're going out.
And if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, Ellen Brody here will be happy to answer them.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Aren't you suiting up, mate?
You called, Doctor?
Yeah, you really don't like him.
I don't like what he does.
Where's the rubber band?
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
What's wrong?
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Michael, the sub's dead.
Where are you going?
I talked you into this?
Are you coming...?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Change your mind?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
Come on.
What do you mean, we don't?
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
Come on!
Who's going to do it?
You don't have to prove anything.
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I can have them walk backwards.
Why are you?
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
Sure.  No problem.
How you doing, Kelly?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
Let's go, let's go!
The space shuttle has landed!
Hold still, damn it!
Buzz off.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
Oh...
How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
Tradition.  Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard.  What I was born to do.
Filter system number four.  Is it large enough?
I'll go with you.
I'll stay out of your way.  I won't interfere.
That's impossible.
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Who's grown up?
That bugger moves fast.
It sure is good to be home....
Turn it off....
No cooking while you're here...No washing dishes...No cleaning....
Henny Youngman....
Whatever happens next.....
That....
You can stay in my room.
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
What?
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
I'll be all right, Michael.
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
You just got here....
Trying to write our report....
It got him....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
What?
Why?
It'll come for the plane.  It's attracted to metal.  The electro- magnetic impulse....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
She's had a lot to deal with...She needs time....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
The readings suck....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Forget it....
We've got a rare bird here, Michael. Great whites don't come to the Bahamas.  There's never been one down here before.  I'm not just going to let it swim away.
How long have you known Hoagie?
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You told me what?
It's my fault...I have to....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? What's the problem?
Be my guest. What you got?
No, Sir. I haven't started till Monday. I'm a "tourist."
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
There's nothing in the files?
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles.
What do you want it for?
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I'm going up to the institute.
How do you know her hair's black?
No, Sir.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
And did they?
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
What does that mean, Sergeant?
Is this normal?
I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?
<u>You</u> put it in there.
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
No. Except he smoked. Like you.
If I came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
Hamlet. Have you read it?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
I have to talk to you, Helena.
I don't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
Why?
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
I don't want them to arrest you.
What are you doing, Travis?
Yes, Sir.
Who sought the warrant?
.. we got a body part. We don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. O.K. Now you know as much as we do ..
When did John divorce?
Two or three years ago.
Is that Margie?
Except for the hair color, she looks just like Suzanne?
Alright, guys. We stop this <u>now</u>.
Shut up, King Jay ..
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
I think I found some- thing horrible, Sir
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
I see what you're saying.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, thanks.
You think so?
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Wonder what he said.
Give me your number.  I'll call tomorrow.  I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now.  But it's going to be great.
Hello?
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?
Hey you.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Well, good evening.
You don't have to explain.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
What --
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Ten seconds, Rod.
I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake?  I'm a very good singer, man --
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years.  What's my family gonna live on? What you get me.  So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
No, I air-dry.
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Dude, know your art form.  If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful.  There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
No, you're --
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Oh, tell the story.
Exactly.  And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
... dick?
You said "fuck".
Nothing.
What did you say!
Young adult.
Eric! Are you here?
You couldn't have made that jump.
He could have died.
Either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the Stone Age.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
That does sound lucky.
How would you classify it?
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
You think they could talk to each other?
In Costa Rica?
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
What did you think?
Why?
How do you mean?
It doesn't matter what I think.
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
Well, I do, and she's fantastic. She'll take you to the museum, maybe to a movie if you play your cards right.  You're going to have a fantastic time.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Cancel that, Dieter.
Okay.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy, I hardly see how I am to--
What do they want?!
It'll hold!
I have to find Kelly!
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
No more smoking.  We leave no scent of any kind.  No hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags.  We will observe and document, but we will not interact.
Are you insane?!
All right.  I'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now. I feel vindicated.  John Hammond will too.  Do you have enough to publish?
These formations.  They're dried --
Hey, I wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
Where's Kelly?
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
You can't hold it by yourself!
You see?  The tyrannosaur doesn't obey set patterns or park schedules.  It's the essence of Chaos.
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Alan, listen to this.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Hey!  Where did you find those things?
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
Yes it is.
Straight-A brainiac!
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
You're married?
Machines hate you?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
What's that?
It's am easy catch, you let - - go - - you do the counting, you count it, Tim.  One, two, three -- you do all the counting, okay?
I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
I'm a hacker!
Hey Lex, ahhhchooo!  Hey Lex, com here.
You tell them if they come up to seventy-five, I'll cut them in on the Crystal Lake package.
No, but...
Just a deer, Mister Biller. Part of the local wildlife.
Yeah?
What?
Who?
Your... client is being booked right now. He'll be in cell five.
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Take it easy, Ruby...	it's all right.  Now, try to think clearly... don't you mean _Jason's_ hand... don't you mean he grabbed a scalpel and slashed Doctor Layton's throat?
He wets the bed?
Well, Jason _was_ in a canoe accident in 1967 and presumed drowned. His mother died a few years later after a long bout with cancer. Some time in the early eighties, there were a string of murders out by Crystal Lake...  People started saying it was Jason... back from the dead.
So, what are you saying... that he didn't kill all those people?
Not much here. Jason was brought in a couple more times for insomnia... that's about it.
Add it to the list.
How long will the effect last?
Yes -- we do.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
Just what you've published.
I read the one about the penal colony.
Did you?
A man must eat --  And drink.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
No, I left it in his office.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
It's not healthy, Kafka -- not for you and not for your workmates.  At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
No, there's only one report to complete.  I'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow.
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
I suspected that he -- well.
What?
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
What's funny?
That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides.  It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
I knew you walked this way to work.  I wanted to find you before they did.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close?
I don't know.
Can I ask -- how you found me?
Maybe it's true then what she said.
-- I was just trying to finish some work!
What's the matter with you?
... A piece of paper ...
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
It's gone out so quickly?
Get the hell out of here.''!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Holy God! The mummy walks!
I want to thank you.
Give it back!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Sorry. 
No.
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Yes -- all right --
-- We can talk --
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How would I remember?
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Try some other ways. 
You said it was!
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Thanks.
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
No.
We did this before.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
John, how are you?
Have you discussed this with them?
All right. All right --  John, just sit tight will you? I'll read your report, I'll discuss it with the others. I'll be back next Thursday, we'll talk the whole thing over then. Nothing til Thursday, all right?
She told me.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Can you account for his disappearance in any way?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
He's right you know. Waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.
Are you closing the case?
What about your mommy?
Playing.
Greatest...
What if she forgets?
I'm allergic to onions.
I want my...mm...ommy...I want mmmy...mommy...
Daddy?
Good night.
Is this really your desk?
Yep.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Yes, your honor.
No, counselor, I'm going to over- rule you on this line of questioning.
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?
No further questions.  Thank you Mrs. Phillips.
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way.
No.
Did he ever fail to provide for you?
I...I don't know...
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
What about Billy?
Look at us, Joanna.  Just like any old married couple having dinner.  Who would believe it.
He looks like a terrific kid.
You've been living here, in the city?
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
O'Connor's out to get you.  He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby.
And?
I know....I know.
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Fine.
Ordered, adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child, effective Monday the 23rd of January.  That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month.  That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.  That's it.
We can appeal, but I can't guarantee anything.
I'll take my chances.
No, but--
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Got it.
You ever think about getting married again?
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
All right, Thelma...That's it. I've had it.  You can call your good friend Joanna Kramer and tell her enough is enough, okay?  I mean, I don't know what I did, but you can tell her she's made her point.
Yes, Holiness.
Not the way to talk to people.
Will you buy the sheep for me?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Soon.
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Not yet, but the Governor of Chamdo, Ngabo Jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking.
Your father had been very sick.
True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Roughly five thousand men.
No. This war is almost over.
Has anyone died?
At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
Do you think I must?
What do you think?
True.
Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.
I will miss you.
You, kill me?
I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
You're a beautiful woman.
<u>Please</u>.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
Around here.  Yeah.
Cocktail?
They come on land and they're brazen.  They're also attracted to noise, you can see I make a lot of it.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
I'm laying a spring trap!
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions.  But if it <u>is</u> a crocodile which I don't think it is.  And if they <u>do</u> charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  With you it makes sense.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
I'm tired, Hector.  I know this because you're beginning to not bug me.
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
But they're nighttime hunters, Hector, he'd probably be on land now anyway.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
They're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  Tranq him in water, he drowns.
Kelly Scott.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
It's too dangerous for--
You flew up here because your boss--
That's probably good.
I didn't say it like that.
A man just died, you're hitting on me with science.
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Like little children.  You okay?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
I'm not mushing it.
He's mooing.
Well...
Different worlds, Jack.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
I'm just curious.  I can never tell what women think is handsome.  Is he handsome?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
They're coming right in.
Should I?
Kevin.  How's it going, what's happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
A tooth?
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
No.
Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me?
Why not?
Clarice - you did the best anybody could have for Catherine Martin. You stuck your neck out for her and you got your butt kicked for her and you tried. It's not your fault it ended this way.
What girl?
Sometimes.
I will... I promise.
Safe, SHIT, he's got a gun! Getmeout. GET ME OUT!
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
Jack Gordon.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You see, the one we want most refuses to cooperate. I want you to go after him again today, in the asylum.
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
To complete and file my report by 0800 Wednesday. But sir -
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to.
I think so.
I have no doubt of it.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
All that detail, just from memory...?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
No, no, no. You were doing fine, you'd been courteous and receptive to courtesy, you'd established trust with the embarrassing truth about Miggs, and now this ham-handed segue into your questionnaire. It won't do. It's stupid and boring.
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
Oh, Officer Starling... do you think you can dissect me with this blunt little tool?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Scared, at first. Then - exhilarated.
I never thought about it.
By the book, he's a sadist.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Killed outright?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
Two months.
On what basis would they reject him?
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
Anger, social resentment, sexual frus-
No. We just -
You know I can't make that promise.
What...?
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
Let us go, miss.
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yours.
Mr Poe?
Where will we go?
You do not know what you are saying!
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.
Fort Edward, then?
Ottawa!
That is sedition! Treason!
I don't understand!
Will you men help us stop the French?
Advance, Sergeant Major!
Right - about face! March! First rank present!
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers... will receive many gifts.
Gifts?
Yes.
Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken together, that's gospel. Your fort will stand or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.
Yes.
Granted.
Le mot d'ordre?
Dead?  This morning you said he had some skin disorder.
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Doc eat already?
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
Bullshit...I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.
No, it's not going through. The intercom's busted.  I thought DeJesus fixed that?
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
That's an order!
That's great.  Now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
How's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
Forty-eight hours!
Not yet.
It...almost got you.
You're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
Hey!...I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!
It's Sixpack!
Getting some food.
Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
Don't spend all day down there.
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Your pocket?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
There are no others.
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond film, is it?
Can I help?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Is he on his own?
Is that you, Dean?
I got the money to pay for 'em.
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?
Who was that?
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have work to do.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.
I think I would rather just turn them over.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I want your bar.
I can't help you, Plank.
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.
What are you doing, Plank?
You know how much it is, Nick.
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
That makes it okay?
You think I can't learn that?
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
No, sir--
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
I do, sir.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks, most of 'em relatives. People breed like chickens.
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
Do I seem jumpy?
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
Uncle Al--
So they stayed in Florida?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
He's still pissed off about it.
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
You lived in the States for a while?
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere--
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
Substance abuse?
You get much of that in here?
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Why would you want to do that?
Protection?
Vi a Rosaria arastrado para el corriente--[I saw Rosaria taken away by the current--]
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
This girl is a friend of yours?
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
Historic occasion, isn't it?
--Santiago.
Right.
I haven't been out here for a while.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
Imonna find out one way or the other.
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Well, you hire illegals--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
And my father?
What about it?
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Something wrong?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Yeah.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah?
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
The shooter local?
How 'bout you?
What's up?
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
You know who it was?
Thirty-five bucks.
Who is he?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
Why did you wait so long?
Yes.
Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
How did it go today?
So why did you marry him?
He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire.
He taught all this to Swann?
Quaid and Jennifer--
Sure.
I got a file on him two inches thick.  He's a petty fraudster. This is something else.  Ever heard of someone called the Puritan?
So could you walk on water?
Great accent, by the way.  Is it Brooklyn?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Philip Swann?
What for?
You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her.
Yeah, I know.
You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes?
Him too.
Jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
I only wear ties for funerals.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Is that all?
At a guess... they just resurrected him.
You didn't try hard enough.
I got to go.  I'm late.
No.
Maybe... I... don't...
Fuck you.
Yes.
These people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
What are you doing here?
How long have you been married?
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
What do you do?
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
I don't want to go home.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
No, you smiled.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
That's ok.
Where'd you grow up?
You made it.
It's for my daughter.
Nice one.
Do you ever see him?
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
That's not what I'm talking about.
I don't know.
Is there anything I can do?
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
Hello, can I have room 5601.
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
Sure.
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
I'm aware of that, but I don't think he's in any condition to make requests. I'm trying to appeal to your more...logical self, Father.  I'm concerned about harm to my patient.
You fucking bastard.
It was perfect.  The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
Why are you doing this to me?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Yes... and you are?
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
And also that...
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Why did he try to kill me?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
I don't understand what's going on.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
Are you alright?
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
What did he say to you in French?
A lot of good that'll do.
Meaning, Viznick's a man who answers to no one.  Not even God.
Right.  If you believe in God.  As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders.  He created the voices after the fact.  In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Would you sign it for me?
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Nothing.
I hate it.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
I can take it.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
What?
So how long is this trip?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
You shoot like a girl.
I wouldn't know.
I don't know.  A lot.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
Kay.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
Your legs don't look broke.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Didn't know you cared so much.
He ain't Spalding.
Four.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
he's just playing, Q...
Who's nobody?
The "man" again.
Can we talk?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Yup.
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Yeah.  Two weeks.  I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Like what?
Maybe go back to school.
Something was just missing.
Then why are you so upset?
What?
You're out of your mind.
So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Give it yourself.
Not great.
What's that, not great?
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
You hearing me?
Don't sweat it, okay.  Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?
And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
no, no, c'mon Jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
Well what's the situation?
I'm here, I'm listening.
It's a helluva disease.
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
What the fuck do you want?
Please.  It doesn't have to be now. Maybe we can make a date to sit down, I didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
Now STOP IT and LISTEN to me right now. I AM DYING, I GOT SICK...now I fell down and I'm Not...DON'T --
Yes.
I got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  Has there been some screaming and yelling?
No.
What are you lookin' for?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
yeah, good, ok.
Please, yes.
Eight o'clock?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Oh, see?  This is great.  Ten o'clock.
Why not?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
To not do that.  To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
What?
I'm sorry --
...nothing.  I'm sorry...
I'm sorry --
Just say no.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
How much you pay me for my help?
Tell me what you know, I'll tell you what I know --
Finish it up without the lip.
Check that ego - come off it - I'm the profit - the proffesor Ima teach you 'bout The Worm, who eventually turned to catch wreck with the neck of a long time oppressor And he's runnin from the devil, but the debt is always gaining And if he's worth being hurt, he's worth bringin' pain in - When the sunshine don't work, the Good Lord bring the rain in.
Doc, just - don't, how close are you?
Who was it that said: "A man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
"If a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "Well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "A little more than kin and less than kind," is Hamlet to Claudius. "The sins of the father laid upon the children," is Merchant of Venice but borrowed from Exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is Two Gentleman from Verona. Where? Who? How and Why, Kids?
I love you.  I love you and I'm sick.  I'II talk to you....I'll talk to you tommorrow.  I'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  For my teeth.  For my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. You have braces.  Me too.  Me too.  I'm getting braces, too.  For you.  For you, dear Brad. And I don't have any money.  And I don't have any money now but I'II get it...I will for you, Brad.  I love you, Brad.  Brad the Bartender.  You wanna love me back?  Love me back and I'll be good to you.  I'II be god damn good for you. And I won't be mad if you don't know who said what. I won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. I can teach and tell you: Samuel Johnson.
I paid you back.
Yes.
I can help you through this the best I know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but I need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
Yeah.
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Yeah.
I've seen it before.
Graduation?
She had cancer...from her...in her stomach and I didn't go anywhere with her...and I didn't do a god thing... for her and to help her....shit...this bitch...the beautiful, beautiful bitch with perfect skin and child bearing hips and so soft...her namewasLilysee?  He liked her though he did, his mom, Frank/Jack...he took care of her and she died. She didn't stick with him and he thinks and he hates me, ok...see...I'm...that's then what you get? ....are you still walkin' in that car...?
Hello?
Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Let's talk about --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
So boring, so useless --
I would just want to clear some things up:
Yes.
Not really.
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
And that's what you've heard?
Are you asking me a question?
I got your message.  That you were trying to get me -- right?
He's in here --?
Uh. huh.
Calm down.
Then you've got nothin' to worry about.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
Are you lyin' to me?
Ok. Marcie. Starting now I want you to have a new attitude with me.  The more you play games, the more suspicious I'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
--- What was that?
What the hell is this Marcie?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
I'm sorry.
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
Slowly or quickly?
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
hey.
Well maybe.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
Did you ever touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
What's MOW?
You have to go, Stanley.  You're the smartest.
Linda --
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Partridge?
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
Are we gonna keep going with this game?
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Alright.
Hi.
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
Yes.
....Why does he do it...?
It's not right.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!
How can I serve you in this?
Your Majesty...
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
Tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
I have it all worked out.
Phillippe -- he's very bright, he's perceptive, but he is in such turmoil --
He can learn to be Phillippe in time.  But first he must learn to be Louis, and for that he has two more days.
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
But -- doesn't God ordain both Pope and King?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
I carried the king's child!  The queen had twins that night, and one of them was sent away, in secret!
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
You are right.  But it is a trap.
We were at her door.  I was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young Musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady-in-waiting for the Queen Mother.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
D'Artagnan!
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
The King killed my son!
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
It is for your security that I have come, your Majesty -- for the security of your honor.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Get out of my way.
Wait.  Bargain me to Louis, for all your lives.  You have done your best.  Let me go, and let all of you find peace.
You dead yet?
... Two-thirty-seven.
You've... memorized...?
The food doesn't please you?
It's lovely.  It's just...
Raoul... Oh, Raoul...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Cooperate?
You mind if I ride with you?
You set to go -
So? Girls left bars with Ted Bundy too. It doesn't rule out foul play.
Gotta come from somewhere...
Who am I?  I'm gonna be your worst fucking nightmare until you start breaking it down for me.  You understand? Where did you get the car!
Anyhow...	you wake up and she's gone. But--  --this is my favorite part--  she leaves you the keys to a brand new Beemer.
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
I was just having a little fun -
No.  A witness.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
No -
No...I'm in some trouble...
And?...
Jimmy, do you realize what you did? Man that's like death penalty shit -
I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network.  I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county.  None of them live in Hollywood.  Do you remember the address?
1490...Breckinridge...
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
A bank?
Are you going to be alright?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Where am I going?
I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
Where?
That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think.
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
Who is it?
Get me a plane...
When are you coming back?
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri.
I'll cover the back.
Not yet.
Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights.
Is that you. D?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
I have work to do at the plant.
Who is it?
Do you pray to God, Mr. Lounds?
No. I don't want to see you.
Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun.'  Do you see?
Please, no.
Do you imply that I'm a queer?
You will tell the truth?
Do you have it?
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they don't have the capacity to even understand what's going on. Do you?
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
What happened to them?
It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep.  I love you...
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Thanks for the lift.
That's right.
I figured I'd ask you...
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
You've read the transcript. It's all there.
Yes, I thought so.
I thought you would have some ideas.
Pray tell.
Don't think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
Because, my dear Will, if this Pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  Have you seen blood in moonlight, Will? It appears quite black. If one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds. I admired it enormously. What a cunning boy you are, Will.
Why does it feel good?
Because he's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Tank you veddy much.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
No.
"No"?  "No" to which part??
I'm sorry, George...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
Andy!
T-there wasn't a reason to purposely hurt me --
Hey Andy, good show.
I'm gonna quit.
Each show is worse than the next.
"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman? And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy Kaufman crazy?"
What is this, World War Two...?
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
"Philosophically"?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
It's a perfect Kaufman audience.
"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.  Bob what?
Lieutenant?
Weird.
You're two hours late.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Are you sure this line is clean?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
... yes.
Operator.
I need an exit!  Fast!
Just get me outta here.
I know.  They cut the hardline. This line is not a viable exit.
Give me your phone.
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
The Matrix?
What are you doing?
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
I thought it wasn't real.
Yeah.
What?  Are you trying to tell me that I can dodge bullets?
Of the Resistance.
Why?
That's why we're here.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
No.  No!  Morpheus!  Don't!
How is he?
But what?
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
Morpheus believes in you, Neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  He believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
How did you do that?
God...
What does that mean?
But an Oracle can.
That's different.
What did she tell you?
What happened?
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
See who?
Neo, this is loco.  They've got Morpheus in a military-controlled building.  Even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  Three of them!  I want Morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
Tank, you're hurt.
What the hell just happened?
Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
Sounds good.
No.
Riverdale.
May God be with you.
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'Thou art then a king?'
Yeah.
You flew before?
It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you.
You got some mouth!
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
Didn't show up.
I'm going to work this week...I mean it.
I'm sorry Charlie...I didn't mean it.
NO!!!  What do you think I am, crazy???
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
My uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...I dunno. Maybe you should speak to him yourself.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
What's a'matter?
Charlie, this is business.
Diane, how are you feeling?
You know Diane...I've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...I... a...I really...think that you're a terrific performer...
Ok.  Chinese.  We'll meet on the corner of 6th Avenue and Waverly Place after you finish.
Why not here...Ok nevermind...6th Avenue and Waverly.
About that shooting last night...I was there and...
Hey, where you been?
Teresa.
No, she's got epilepsy.
Her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am I gonna tell them?  Lock her up?
Who knows?  It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest.  You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
What was it?
Take your time.  I don't care.
See that...know who lives there? The name George Earhardt mean anything to you?
Come on.
This is some boat.  Your father's?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Yeah, it's your father's.
Have you got a minute?
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
And that?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
Red or white?
Toast?  No...just the butter.
...See you tomorrow night.
That may be.  But I don't like the fucker.  I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you.  And vice versa.
We're not getting anywhere here. Why don't we take some of the best out of this thing, let's consider it coolly, let's take a week --
Why yes, thank you.
May I interrupting?
Perhaps you could remind me.
Did you just hear something?
Like a marriage made in heaven?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
Shall we adjourn?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
And what do I get?
Yeah, that's what he said.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no.  I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Thanks.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Come again?
Then why are you here, Joe?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
Excuse me?
He's taking a nap.
Did you like making love to me?
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Will it?
It's a saying.
Susan --
That's it?
Joe, that's the kitchen.
'Threw' you?  Where?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
A 'deal'?
Yes?
Make an exception?
Yes.
-- What's the deal here?  Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Truly - uh - splendid.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either!  You!  Drew!  I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
About Susan?
I wouldn't put it that way.
What's okay?
'Fish'?
I'm not hungry.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
Say again?
I'm sorry, Bill --
Those were my words, Bill.
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
You are --?
You should hope quite a while.
The great Bill Parrish at a loss for words?  The man from whose lips fall 'rapture' and 'passion' and 'obses- sion'...all those admonitions about being 'deliberately happy', what there is no sense 'living your life without...', all the sparks and energy you give off, the rosy advice you dispense in round, pear-shaped tones --
I want to have a look around before I take you.
What question?
Next week?
This one.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
No, I'm going to stay down here, keep my finger in the dike and maybe by Monday, the waters could recede.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Not my birthday again?
You mean like you loved Mom?
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without.  If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?  I say fall head over heels.  Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back.  And how do you find him?  Forget your head and listen to your heart.  I'm not hearing any heart.  Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back.  Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.  To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try.  Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
You're terrible.
What?!
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Then what will you say?
What was that?
I agree --
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
66.
What can I do for you, Leonard?
That's the thing. I have this condition.
This isn't my room?
A cop?
Who did this to you?
Where'd you get it?
Sorry, I should have explained. You see, I have this condition -
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
His name was Jimmy.
Kill him.
And what did he say?
What's wrong?
Who?
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
No!
Kill him. I'll pay you.
I'm meeting someone called Natalie.
You're the memory guy?
Who's your boyfriend?
My name's Leonard.							 *
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
Yup?
You don't know him?
I didn't sell -
I know, you investigated. Maybe you need to apply some of your investigative skills to yourself.
Yeah, well, thanks for the advice.
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
No, you won't.
What's your twenty?
I was the kids' godfather.
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
Okay.  What'd you spot...?
José Yero changed-up the drop plan on us.  He's grabbed Gina.
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
Two main players plus three.
25% discount on the load.
You do.
No.
You know how improbable this is...?
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Zero risk.
'Cause you don't lose loads?
'Cause we <u>guarantee</u> every load.  Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No part of it wasn't real.
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours?
Packaging?
You got something to say, José, let's hear it.
Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So...
How much we looking for?
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
No.  Havana, Louisiana.  Don't we have a meet?
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy...
What's the point?  It's going down.
That's right.
Who are you talking to?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You okay?
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Define small.
Equipment?
Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki...
What you gonna do back there, East?
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
For what?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
What for?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
Kee-rist, you pretty damn clever for a skimpy little gimp.
Respect shee-it! You even steal flowers for his grave.
But thanks.  Hey, Joe, don't get sore about this or anything. You promise?
I'm going to Florida, that's my only chance.
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
What d'you want?
Get outta my way.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
Yes, I believe you are. Cowboy, huh?
Uh, yessir.
Get lost.
History, man, history. How much?
Want me to take over?
Anybody bitten?
Too bad you didn't have a machine.
Shit.
Yeah. How's Mom?
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
Where you staying, Dad?
Those mountains? are they?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
But just...
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to.
How long?
And?
You got your stuff?
We go back.
What?  You gotta be joking.
Yeah.
Hishradyo.
What?
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
You can't take anything seriously.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
You're ayip!
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Know what?
Hey, you can't...
Yeah...?
There's really people living down here?
I think so. One right, two lefts...
Yeah, and you gonna have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. That's the old maintenance grid, Doc. Swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
Any luck?
What?
The kid's with them!!
My God, what the hell are you...?
What are you putting that crap on me for?
But the power...
What?
Oh, no, you were-
Ironic, don't you think?  These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
It's me. Can you hear me?
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
It worked before...
The scent won't last...
C'mon...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Oh, my!
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
What's your new book called?
No. No, it isn't, it's--  --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would "great" be insulting?
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
Perfect.
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
I don't know.
You just expect me to whip something off, that it?
--not fair?
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
You can--you have the "gotta"--
To celebrate Misery's return. I couldn't have done it without you.
Well, it certainly says you.
You really think so?
The book is almost finished. Your legs are getting better. Soon you'll be able to walk. You'll be wanting to leave.
Paul, I know you've been out.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right?
Yeah. They're in the semis.
All done, chief..
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?
Where is it?
How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me?
How I usually find you, Nyah.
A change of plans?
Bellerophen?  No time at all once I've got it.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
-- now here's the way it's going to work..Wallis, the shares outstanding are..
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane.
Billy.  I think we got a problem.  Nyah's on the wing.  Up early.  Billy, do you copy?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
- right..where is it?
- this is very disconerting..
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Ethan Hunt.
Awfully short notice..
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
So where did I got right?
You're not a liar.  Or you're an awfully good one..  ..this thing these blokes pinched..
Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up.
Before you are.
Where do I meet you?
If that's what you're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane.  Locating him in time to stop something like that -
- is where Miss Hall comes in.
Something else?
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane, but he didn't get the Chimera virus.
Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
Oh, please!  How was I to know they had to be treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours?
By asking me.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his transportation.
This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like.
Don't give me that!  I was on the bridge.
There was nobody on the bridge.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
Kittridge...
I sent the message to Max.  Weíre on for tomorrow.
Are you damaged?
Youíre in Prague?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
I don't quite follow you.
That's right.  Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314".  The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
Why not?  You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
On what?
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
IMF mainframe.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Then what am I doing here?
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
He's our guy.
Can you lose him?
About two hundred yards from the bridge.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  Iíll call you from Paris.
Of course I can hear you.
Jack you're so wicked.
Is something wrong with the phone?  Well is something wrong with the batteries?
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Where you been?
Where's Ma?
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Maybe.
He did?
Mona?
What'd you do to your hair?
I don't know. I got a feeling.
It's wrong to just let them go.
He's in Palermo.
Why?
Where'd Johnny find you?
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
She didn't like me.
No thanks.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
This is your place.
No.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Bye, Aunt Rita.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
I shouldn't.
Will you marry me?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
I don't understand.
Have you told her we're getting married?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
No.
So we'll sell the house.
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
What about the moon?
No.
We just come from the bank.
I know.
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I'm sure she did.
What happened?
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I think it's because they fear death.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
Cosmo.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second.   right?
Dennis! There's some lovely filth down here ...  Oh! how d'you do?
Well, how did you become king, then?
Knights Who Say "Ni" ... we are but simple travellers.  We seek the Enchanter who lives beyond this wood and who ...
All right!  What do you want?
That is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly - But there is one small problem.
What is that?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Look!
Stop that.
I'm invincible!
Now what happens?
What?
We shall attack at once.
Behind the rabbit?
It is the rabbit.
Well ... I AM king.
Yes.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Yes, Lord.
What is your name?
I think I could pull through, sir.
They cost fifty pounds each!
Listen, Alice ...
Leaving the room.
What?
We'll cover your escape!
No.  It's unhealthy.
Well,  what seems to be the trouble?
You got my note!
Well ... yes ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
|      You turd! +      Mangy scots git!
The good-looking one.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
I'm getting dressed.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
It's a diary.
The place is a mess.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
A situation?
Convey her a message.
I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?
Mother....
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
There are important papers from --
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Oh.
Maybe, once.
Why?
Yes, ma'am.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
They're ready now.
Someone has to look after you.  It could've been someone.  It was before.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.
Well?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
Does that thing work?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
Talk to me.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?
So where is he?
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
So how did it know my name, then?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
SLIP-STREAM.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
What are you looking for?
Yes I am...
I already have a boyfriend, Nick.
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Okay.  It's West.
So that's what we almost died for?
I'm okay.
Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.
So how did you do it, Alex?
What did he do to you?
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?
That's impossible.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I know.  Where are you Adam?
You gotta be kidding?
I'm just offering a place to stay.
So what's the problem?
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!
Yeah.
No problem. What's on your mind?
So since you agree I guess you could be a person who does not care about the good life.
How...  how'd they know I was here?
So, what did they say?
I...
No, I don't.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
No. I can't.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
No.
What's wrong?
Well...  what do you think about then? I mean...  well what do you think about?
Unh, unh.
Okay... but just...just to see.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Yes, Sir.
Yeah, what for?
Could be unrelated.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nice wallets.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
No.  I haven't seen any.
A brunette? ... maybe beat up?
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Look, there's another train. They'll send it through here. You're fucked if you don't STOP and listen to me.
I'm listening.
How long till the room fills ?
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
This is cute.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
That was eleven years ago.
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Wait for what ? i don't wanna alarm you but we'll be the special at the International House of Pancakes in about five minutes !
Okay, NOW I'm worried. What exactly is on the other side of the door ?
An elevator ?
Don't.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
He probably has a history of this shit.
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Well ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
Yes sir.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
What do you mean sir ?
John, sir.
Only that you were one of the finest hit men in the mob. That if you wanted a good clean kill, that Johnny Tortelli was the man for the job.
Just a temp who pissed me off and a girl who turned me down for the night of her life.
We can't afford too many surprises.
Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
What happened ?
Really ? On a date ?
Thank you, won't you come in ?
Would that impress you ? I mean you're the kinda woman that probably has Ferrari written all over your personal ad.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Are you okay ?
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
Excuse me I asked you a question.
This is California, anything is possible.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
Well maybe you should join a hippie commune. But let me tell you something. Sooner or later it's gonna be your turn to take out the garbage.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Suspended from school, my mother??
Pommeroy...he may or may not be driving a black 54 Ford Pickup.  Monday.
Do what?
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Seriously?
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
What does that mean?
Hi honey.
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
I'm glad you're here.
I told you it was a long story.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
oh.
He likes you.
But I wanna write about her.
Hi.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Change my name.
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
And I thought I was weird.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
What do you think?
Write me a poem?
You're a good man Nicholas.
But...are you engaged or something?
Lock the door.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
WHAT?
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Harry, I really think she.....
I wrote that.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
This is where we are.
I haven't danced in.....
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Shelly?
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Of course not.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
He's okay isn't he?
What was my mama like?
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
This is one big house for one single person.
I paid the money.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Please.
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
Who's that?
No....
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
He likes her.
Do you like her?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Maybe black means you're happy?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Big Ringo fan.
Uh huh.
Have you ever tried any?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
I'm eleven and a half.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
I will I promise.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
I'm trying.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
Is that your Dad?
It's my mother.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
Hi Vada.
Leave then, some friend you are.
It is not.
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
No.
Like this?
Just do it.
You don't miss much.
You've been working on this, huh?
Major.  Dish.
Needing.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
About Michael's job.
I mean, he loves his job.
Wallace egregious residence, Mandy speaking.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
And she's all wrong for me!
Well, somet...
She finds him "personable."
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Dance card filled?
Michael? What ha...
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
Lower.
I never forgot that.
Kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  Walter supplied the decorative touches...
Oh the way out of the crab house? We asked Michael if we could see the ring?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Hi! Star.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Whose word?
Who the hell is he?
D.C.
He saw us at Tammany Hall.
Need to have you check these out before he goes on that Walker benefit.
You go out in the woods and shoot targets -- Whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Mr. Green?
Did you see who that was?
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
We don't mess with accessories.
Mom?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Listen. Maybe I should go...
When I was little, in church.
Yes, it is --
It just is.
Well...How have you been?
Who is this?  It's Tom.
Thirty?
Oh.
Just got out. Had me thirteen lawyers. Missed the electric chair twice. .. Been out three months. Are you heavy?
I'm not sure...
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
We just got a gold record.
Do you study at all?
The architect  His buildings are drippy. You know, like sand and castles. Then I got this assignment. They want to start in two weeks.
Well, I really think he's got a chance.
He is to a lot of people.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
You really do?  ~ God -- How come you know them?
You think I should take lessons?
Yes you are.
What did you think then?
I wondered how long it would be before we'd get to be alone together. And I wondered if I could wait that long.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Mickey!
Because they wouldn't give them their blessing for marriage.
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Yes.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
On average forty million.
It's like this, Wayne. Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack. These two people can't see each other, yet they know they're there. Now, they can either stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom, or one of them can make the first move.
Mickey and Mallory have that edge.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
Rockin'!
Are you all set?
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
It sure is.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Man, the darkest thing they got in there is Coca-Cola.
They done that too long in my family.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Okay.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
You a union man?
What d'you think?
I know.
Yeah.
Where was that?
Okay.
Any other family?
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
Yeah, I been there.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Not here, Duff.
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
No.
Surprised?
What's he like?
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
Don't call them that.
What about him?
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
They won't.
Day work.
No point fixin' it!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
What you gettin' all pretty for?
Just get her drunk.
I asked you somethin', boy!
I heard you.
Want me to hold the light for you?
What did you say, boy?!
I said, she's in great shape.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
That's right.
Can't live without trouble, can you?  Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Oh yeah?  Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
Man, you won't like that back seat.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
Shut up, Will.
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
Better now.  Where 'you at?
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
Ghost a steppin' razor...
What's an A.I.
My days of punching deck are over. For you or anybody else.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
You ran without us.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
That's Lord Frederick Tessier. Owns most of Freeside. Wintermute's mainframe is centred in the Royal Family's villa.
As long as you cooperate.  I want it now, Armitage.
Can you read my mind?
Are you even really alive?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
She's ready to go.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Don't patronise me, you fuck. I was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  Hey, Kid... you expecting company?
No problem, amigo.
What?
Getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. What we got here is one mad dog schizo A.I.. Armitage is right about one thing, Bro. If we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
How much time you got left?
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
What is it?
How long have I been out?
That's not going to help.
Not anymore. You got a new pancreas. Armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Won't that mean you're dead?
Molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
Yeah... fine.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Shit...
What is it?
I'm still going in.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
What's that?
What?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Forget it.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Okay. That's bad.
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
wait, rewind. Do you really think she hooked-up with our Rob? They're so--different.
Wannabes. Kirsten transitioned last year.
Josie, you have totally transitioned.
Do I want to be crunched?
How many times have I fired her?
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
And that's the best part.  "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Hey there.
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
Is that true?
And a gymnast!
Rufus?
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
I don't know.
Kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
Josie, you look Rufus.
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
<i>                      I wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
The deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, Sally... I thought I'd find you here....
Don't tell me it's not the gas!  Your mother thought she smelled gas.
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
I'm scared, Grady.  I know it sounds crazy.  But, there's something trying to get into my body.
I believe you.  You had some scary dreams, okay?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.
Like a haunted house, right?  I don't believe in ghosts.
About not finding any bogey men?
Yeah?
Maybe it only happens when you're sleeping - that's the way it was with Nancy, wasn't it?
What is it?
you didn't say more than two words to me the whole way here.  You had another nightmare, didn't you?
You should eat something - you'll feel better.
Jess?
I thought I'd wait for you.
Morning, Doctor Goldman.
Watching TV.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?
I'm glad things have worked out for you.
Stay out of my face or I'll go straight to Max.
The whole wing's devoted ot this program.  That's your office.
Puttin' in soem late hours, I see.  If you're trying for O.T., you're in the wrong place.
It beats Dr. Simm's theory.  She thinks it's nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
It's over.  It's over.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
That's right.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
The truth.
Who is he?
Okay, straight talk only in here.
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
You can't!  They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
Purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  Twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
I won't allow it.
Uh, fourteen.
Doesn't count.  You gotta say the words.
Good.  You conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  What do you do?
We're here.
Wait a minute.  What about me?
Now you're lying.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
God, that's an enormous arse.
Films mainly.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Thank you.
Oh hi.  Forget something?
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Okay -- fine.
I thought you were leaving.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Yup.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
No.  What's that?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Well, thank you.  Anyway -- time for bed.  Or... sofa-bed.
That's not true.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
You disappeared.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
I haven't decided.
Can I have your autograph?
He's bringing a girl?
He wouldn't say.
Where are you going?
That's nice.
Bloody hell, this is fun.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Working with Leonardo.
Ahm... room service.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
Yes?
Are you a fan of Henry James?
Right, right.  Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
Well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I'll tell you if I enjoyed making it.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
So it could have been neither of them?
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
You haven't slept with her, have you?
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?
How about Miss Flintstone?
No, no.  She doesn't.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Ahm let's see -- ahm.  No.  Gone completely.  Oh no, wait.  There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Which was?
Spike!
Which floor?
How was she?
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Is it true McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped yesterday?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
What for?
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
I'm proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
Whatcha boys playin'?
B-B-Billy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Y-y-yes! Yes! Y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
Th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
O-o-o-oh...
Wh-wh-wh-wh...
So long suckers.
I-I d-d-don't know! M-M-Miss R Ratched g-g-g-g...
Shit! This is too much!  Chief, I tell you we're gonna bust outta this place an' make it all the way to Canada before they know what bit 'em.
What for?
She won't give me any more cigarettes!
Let's go, for Christsakes...
It's the questions she asks.
What? What?
He's a big flounder. Could weigh two, three hundred. You got to lift him in with a winch.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Twenty-five dollars.
He can't hear you!
Don't you have any clubs?
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Yesterday...
Oh, what was that?
Poker!
In what way?
I don't, Doc...
The doctor at the prison states: 'Don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' What do you say to that?
Jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, don't she!
'Kay, Mac!
You look pretty healthy to me.
That angel of mercy, he ain't a she, is he?
No...
Yeah...
Hit me!
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Ya fuckin' coon, you're not on the ward now!
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?
She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
You ask what room he's in, okay?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Oh no.  Do you?
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
A restaurant.  In Piazza Navona.
Amazing.
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
That's not the point.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Do you want me to do it?
Hey--
What?...
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
Yeah.  Well, was the least I could do.
Hi.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
Hello.
Excuse me?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
No.
Is he married?
Is he gay?
You don't have any idea?
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
But what?
I know.  You're right.
No...  I can just tell.
I have vacation time coming to me.
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
What'd you find?
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
Larry bought himself cologne?
Her brother.
He's heeeeeerrre...
What?
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
Amazing...
Whatareyoudoing?!
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
Kate is that you?
And Larry?...
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
Giovanni.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
Where is she?
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
It'll do.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Boss loader!
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Do you like pigeons?
Thanks anyway.
What for?
The things that go on.
Wham... .
How about another one?
Were you really a prize fighter?
Terry!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts— you're driving me nuts— stop worrying about the truth— worry about yourself.
What I did to Joey.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
This is my business.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Those blood suckers. How I'd love to fix those babies but—
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
Never will be much too soon.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
You looking for me?
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
Such as what?
Condolences. How you fixed for cabbage this mornin'?
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Yeah— us Golden Warriors.  You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
I know, Johnny, I know... .
Aw, Johnny... .
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
You got some nerve.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
Go on, beat it!
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Keep Charley out of this.
Maybe I will— one of these days.
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
Yes, that sudden.  If it weren't for you we wouldn't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this.  It's all your fault.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then why do you shake so?
I don't like snakes.  I remember the one Cleopatra used.  Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue, and those two sharp fangs.  You'd never think such a little thing packed such a big wallop.
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
I could make her another Cleopatra...
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
And the one driving the other car?
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He called the day he escaped.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months.  Soak the prison off me.
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying."  Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge.  Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him.  They'd been together ten years.
Now that's a really big house.
Yes, she did.
Did you give her a jump?  If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
They found the safe.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
No, I didn't know that.
There a problem, Foley?
I bet.  How much?
Who's sitting here?
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
That's funny.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That's my dad.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
You really wear that suit.
I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
So she did help you?
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
You just did, for Christ sake.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
You goin' right back to work?
Foley?  That you?
I were you, I'd get up and run.
That time?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
Do we have a gun in the car?
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
You there?
Thing I'm worried about is you.
I think you're forgetting, this is my car.  I drove it up here.
That was some shit, huh?
Hi, Ray.
Flyweight.
You like to sit down?
You a lawyer?
Oh, he's moved out?
Dad...
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
You here all by yourself?
Did you pay the guy the reward?
Ten gees.
...the fuck is this...
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
You know the football player, Red G- Grange?  Well the guys called me R-Red, cause you know, I'm red...and they thought I was strange, so, you know, Red G-Grange, Red Str-Strange.
On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
I have to talk to Evelyn.  And I want you to meet her.
Sure you did.  So come on.  Say what you think.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
It's tight.
I'm out of ammo!
Fun today.  Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Maybe just trying to measure up.
I can't make it.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes.  Real straight, frugal.  My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along.  Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral.  He took me back to his house, and I never left.
How's everything?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
What's Peggy Sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Charlie really has a great voice.
And we're here on the couch...
Charlie...
You got a Tab?
Why wait?
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Where did you get that sweater?
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
What do you know about classical music?
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
Just take a look at it. 
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Are you for real?
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
Oh! You did that on purpose! I hate you. Go gargle with razor blades!
How come we're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores?
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
This is great reefer.
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
It's Charlie!
Thank God for that.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen.  Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -—how could you do that?
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
Would you get that, dear?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
For what?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Don't eat the red ones.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
What's that?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Okay. I promise.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Like what?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
What will they be made of?
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
What's the matter?
I think so.
Geoff?  Anybody see my boy?
Mom...
I don't know what to do, Bob.
What's wrong with your face?
Aren't you giving an exam?
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
You're scared. You think we're near the end.
I'm trying to help your "partner." You're not a member of his immediate family, I could have you removed from the ER.
Little baby girl.
Nine.

Your... lover?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Okay... They want you out. It's against the law to fire you for having AIDS, so they make you look like a fuck up. Which leads us to the mysterious, lost file.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha.
The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS.
So Kenton connected the... lesion, <u>and</u> whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent.
Arline decision. Supreme Court.
Correct.
Beckett?
What kind of person is that?
Rach.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Not unnecessary ones.
Yes.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
Absolutely.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
Is that a question?
Objection!
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
Uh.... No. Not really.
According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that?
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
How many gays do you know?
Right.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Going on... like...?
You taught him a lesson.
But didn't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres, after you found out she had AIDS? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her, is that correct?
With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we?
Let's continue.
It's good to be King, hey Charles?
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Mean the whispers?
What whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
They're coming.
I asked what <u>you</u> thought.
Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a woman.
Just come with me!
They're already dead. Get on board.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
You'd die for them?
What do my eyes see?
There....
How many bottles?
Hey, who?
Big Evil?
Thought you found his restraints over there. Toward sunset.
Better keep moving....
No juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. But we might be able to adapt --
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
<u>We're gonna find the body</u>, Johns. Christ, you're a cop. Why am I tellin' you this? We gotta go down and find it.
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Let's wait on the power cells.
May've noticed chains don't work on this guy. Only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. But if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
For your own fear.
How much you weigh, Johns?
We aren't completely stupid.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
Well? Is it just the pump?
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Where's Mr. Johns?
...then we saw this.
Say that again.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Such as.
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
Just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
Seal the cave?
Do you have any weapons?
The best. But we won't need them.
Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft. Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
What's so special about him?
Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking him?
I don't. And I'm not going to try.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
How did it go?
Which direction?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
Those fools and their torches! Do you have any ointment?
It's no use ... there she goes.
Can we take a dip?
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
I think you're making a mistake.
A man, Dr. Maximus.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
This is a joke in very poor taste.
How so?
I'm not protecting anybody! That hearing was a farce. What have I done?
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Because you are a man. And you were right -- I have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him -- even himself.
Yes.
But there's the doll, sir.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
C'mon man, didn't I do you right that time I give you the turkey loaf for the ham and lima beans shit.
Whaddaya talking shit for man. Hey Junior! Y'ever smoke any shit?
Youse so fucked up man.
Hey take it easy man. They're scared.
Hey Taylor, you okay man?
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
You know what I'm talking about!
Sounds pretty far out to me 'Lias.
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
You don't want to hear about it?
No thanks, I've seen Seattle.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Yes?
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
And do you amuse the guests?
You're drinking it.
Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
They'll know whether he killed himself.
Quarter after one. Why?
There's a lot of night left to live through.
So there is. You don't want to go to bed. I don't want to go to bed. Let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
You, too?  My name is Betty Mayfield. I was born, and I am here. Message ends. That's what I told him. He didn't like it.
Is this the best you can do?
Why not?
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
They'll look for you.
Frozen.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
So could you.  But our records were a little against us.
Don't go soft on me, baby.  I've got your note in my pocket.  You wrote it, all by your own self. And I have to use it.  It has to be found in exactly the right place.
Mitchell was dead enough.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Well, that's not getting us anywhere. You won't tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. You won't even give me your address in the United States. Why? Unhappy marriage?
We try to be decent.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
Name it.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
What's this in favor of?
In case you want to have us followed.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Mitchell was too drunk.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
What?
How would you know, Brandon?
What are you doing here?
I don't think you locked your door.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
Would you?
One of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  Not too fat- not too thin.
You get it's brother.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Not too hard, is it?
Where's the shell?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble.  What do I do?  What would you do?
Do I know who lives down there?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
You win, Inspector.  You win all along the line.  Why didn't we think of Brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  Yeah.  Of course you did.  When a suspect thinks he's safe, you go on letting him think he's safe. Wait for a mistake.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
May you what?
Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
I'll investigate Mr. Clarendon's financial position--
I don't understand.
So far.
You'll have to take my word for it.  We don't make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
I believe you won decorations during the war.
I'm afraid you're not very glad to see me, Margo.
So-so.
You shouldn't. You washed me up very thoroughly.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
I hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. I wasn't lucky.
I've always been a heel. I guess I always will be.
You don't have to make a pose of it.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
Of course.
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation.  I didn't want it to be forgotten.  And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since.  I don't think I'm your man.
My husband apologises for not joining us.  It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Well, I'd hate to be a nuisance.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now — the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act.  A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it.  The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
How's Mary?
Of course.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
I couldn't bear for it to end.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
Both dead.
You don't trust me.
I think she liked me.
I might.
Might?
We don't seem to get much time to talk.
The torture of small children--
Yes, finally.
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
You're a piece of shit
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Thanks.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Hello, Jimmy.
I'm sorry about Saturday, Dad.  It was just impossible to get away.
It was last year.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
It's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  One last speedstar.
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
What's this?
I'm not armed.
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
This is us.  Bank Robbery.  And you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
You're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, Utah?  I don't know why they sent you to LA.  Must be an asshole shortage.
A little mushy.
They found the drop car up on Mulholland.  I want you two to go work it.
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Sex wax?  You're not into kinky shit, are you Angelo?
Did he rob it?
Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man, which I always hate because it looks bad on the report.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
I came out here from Ohio a month ago.  Never saw the ocean before.  I didn't think it would effect me so much.  Like I'm drawn to it, or something.  I want to do what you do.  It's the truth.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Look at you.
I... I gotta go.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
I can't believe Jim Hopper walked into an ambush.
Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.
Billy's on it.  Heat seeker. Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
We can reach an understanding on this.
No.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Quiet.  Would I get the loans?
You'd be initiating a financial battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr. Harris.
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
Good.  Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
Sit... and spin.
Stolen?
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
For an hour.
Better believe it.
Always.
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Why?
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I think you'll approve.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
What if I lose it?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
What did you do to him?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
You're packing.
Oh, god, what?
Fill me in on this.  How'd you and Vivian meet?
Doing what?
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
Did I wake you?
I'm up.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
You broke my nose.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
You sure you won't come with me?
You bullshittin' me?
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Oooh, I love those.
You're a guest here?
And who is that?
Niece?
Hmmm... I vonder vich. 
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  All right now, pay attention please.  Salad fork.
They will serve salad.
Then you would use your--
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Are you looking for something in particular?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
What is with you?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Then I'm here till I die?
May I live a thousand years and never hunt again.
Every ship but the four you sent.
Should I be?
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Nothing you can say will upset me.
Singed a bit, were you?
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
-- I do not accept excuses.  I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Hello.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.
Where did you get that?
It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
Rise and report.
-- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Now?
Now?
-- offer me everything I ask for --
-- anything you want --
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Thank you for everything.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
You are ready, then?
You're sure nobody's following us?
Go in, get after her!
You've made your decision then7
-- get back, witch --
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
A little bit.
You are sick, that's why he's here.
How would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
Do the books!  Do the books!
Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
Well, sir, it seems ...
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
It makes a great deal of difference. That's fraud.  If they found out, you could go to prison.
Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you.
Assume away!
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.
What is she gonna do here?
Why?  Take it when you can get it! Flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
Roger De Bris is the worst director that ever lived.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
What???
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
No kidding?
Really, I never dreamed ...
You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one...
Good.  Good.  We go Motel.
Get car.  Get car.
So, the Count hired you this morning, Rudolfo ... Watch the road ... Watch the road.
Like clockwork.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.
By the sacred memory...
The Graf Spee...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Where are you going vit the light?
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
He's the only cat left that still grooves me.
I don't really forget the sign, it just doesn't seem... any use.  This used to be the main highway.  Want to register, please?
You out to buy a motel?
I didn't think the police went searching for people who weren't in trouble.
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
Don't know where she got "Marie," but "Samuels" figures. Her boy friend's name is Sam.  Was she in disguise? Or do you want to check the picture again?
What do you mean?
How did she pay you?
I do mind. If it don't jell, it ain't aspic!  This ain't jelling.
Anyone at home?
No. I told you, she's confined...
Why?
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Well... heck, this is the first time I ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I'd figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
A good reason, I suppose.
What do you know about it?
What thing could we be in together?
You want me to stay here?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
It's been three.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Where's the old highway?
Just wait here?
No Arbogast. No Bates. And only the old lady at home...  A sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
Does that mean we can't...
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but...
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
You going to wait here for me?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
Sorry.
What?
What is it?
Why not?
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
Sam!
I have to go, Sam.
I can come down next week.
No.
And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale. We'll have a lot of laughs. When I send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
Where are you going? I don't mean to pry...
Except you.
Crane.
No, m'am.
Is there?
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Barefaced.
I suppose you want a cabin.
I don't know what you've been saying.
I've been talking about your mother... about your motel. How are you going to do it?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Did you wish to see someone?
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
So--friendly or otherwise--?
No-
No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
I understand from your neighbors that all [them] cats are making noise at night. Dr. Meirschultz has put in a complaint.
What' s the idea [of wanting so many] do you sell them [to the doctor]?
Well, news of Buckley?
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Take me down there.
Oh, <U>I'm</U> crazy, am I? Let me tell you something.  Those women have--the gleam--
That called ... commanded ...
The blood transfusion is now in progress. The only words are curt orders like: 'Now! - Quickly! - That's enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!' etc.
There's no hurry. It's early.
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
Don't kid yourself -- she means it.
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
You mean he was colored?
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
That is none of our business.  But you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti! 
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
We'll grant that.
All right, Master Mind.  But there's something cockeyed about that joint and I'm going to find out what it is. 
Oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
That's what I said.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Old Howard Winton's cub?
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
There's an autopsy ordered at Bellevue immediately. You better skip over there.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Fine, thanks.
Come on, old man, that won't do. You know you're innocent until proven guilty.
You weren't going with her?
I told you I didn't want to mix in it.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
Oh, is that what caused it?
How much money have you got?
My partner believes that I should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of London. At such times Marie Antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion I gave to her.
I came back for some of the books. I am trying to straighten out the accounts. I don't hope to impress you, but I may as well tell you: We haven't a farthing!
A fire! Is this your idea of humor, my friend?
What are you laughing at?
You did.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Then you get it.  You'll understand.
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
In what sense were they bad?
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
You were pretty bad, huh?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
Actually, I am, though.
Well, some fiend might.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Rose, they could stick splinters under my fingernails, and I will never say a word! I will never tell them, because... I love you!
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
He did?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Okay.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook!
Yeah, he's still up there.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
The new girl is here.
You mean confirmed, Mother. I didn't confirm it before. I would have had to confirm it previously, in order for it to be reconfirmed.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out!
What's goin' on?
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
I can use a drink after the plane ride I had.
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
Well, you have knocked me for a hell of a loop, old man. A hell of a loop.
I think we both know her.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed.  I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
Honey!
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Rose, what are you doing up?
Got yourself up?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
How can the buttons stand the pressure?
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today?
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me!
I see. Outside it.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
You can stop it right now.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
You're not gonna see him again.
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
You think it's that good?
Kittle...
Oh, you fuckers!  You fucking fuckers!  What?  What do you want?
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Tell me something... what's a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  I mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
Jeez... it's too early in the morning for this.  Leave off.  Here's your paper.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Look, Kittle... pull over and let me out.  I'll be fine... okay?  How 'bout that... ?  Oh, Lord almighty, listen to me... I don't want to die!!  Lemme out of this coffin!!
What's the plan?
What's mine say?
"Leo.  The stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  Wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
It doesn't say that.
I can't believe we're stealing.
Pardon me... my mistake.  Taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
Pure horse.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
You need a doctor.
You get him?
Get his attention.
You suck at lying, Archie.
See... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
You see that?
Yoda spoke of another.
Your eyesight will return in time.
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Luke.
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
What's going on?
I'm sorry.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your apparent lack of progress.
Good shot, Red Two.
Yes. It's you Leia.
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you.
But, why must you confront him?
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
There is no conflict.
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now.
I know, but it wasn't all bad was it? I think you found it quite pleasurable.  Oh so soft.  So sensual.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Janet.
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
We can't go anywhere until I get to a phone.
So baby don't cry like there's no tomorrow After the night there's a brand new day. And there'll be no pain And no more sorrow. So wash your face And phone my place It'll be O.K.
I wanted to be loved completely. My body throbbed excitedly.  Oh Brad, Brad my darling, how could I have done this to you?
That ain't no crime
The Master is not yet married.  Nor do I think he ever will be.  We are simply his servants.
Who's Eddie?
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
It doesn't bother me either.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
Is everything all right?
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
...Like you?
I can't go out.
It's not your house --
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
One more round.
Damn.
Fouls.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
I don't like ya face.
Here -- Three minutes.
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
Yeah.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
What?
Why?
What?
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work...  Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
How old?
Come July, twenty-five.
Yeah, Kayo.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Here's the card?
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Freak luck for sure.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
I got pain an' experience too.
Please, kid.
Whatta you get outta this?
Wanna keep goin'?
Ya sappin' his strength -- He's losin' steam.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Whatta you think?
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
So much has happened lately -- Has it changed your life style much?
Do you have anything derogatory to say about the Champion?
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
I know who you are.  Kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
He comes here every night to see Jessica Rabbit.
A tweeting bird?
I've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
Can you get him out of it, Eddie?
What was <u>that</u>?
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
Surprised?
Toon cops worked me over.
Yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
You shot Roger.
Hold on a second.
Doom.
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
I've already seen your photographs.
Have you got the will?
Meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. If you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Yeah.  Except they screwed up.  I don't think they got the will.
An arsonist and a kidnapper.  He just got outta prison.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
A Toon?  Noooo.
You know, Eddie, I'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
By the way, Roger, you were right about your wife.  She's a good lady.  I'm glad you got her back.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
I do bite my thumb, sir!
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Then I'll leave thee.
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Is the day so young?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Out--
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
I'll not endure him.
Hold Daughter!
I do spy a kind of hope, Which craves as desperate and execution as that is desperate which we would prevent. If, rather than to marry Paris, Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself, Then it is likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death, to chide away this shame. No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest . Each part, deprived of supple government, shall stiff and stark and cold appear, like death. Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead. Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all he kindred to the Capulet lie. In the meantime, against thou shalt awake, shall Romeo by my letters know our drift, and hither shall he come. And that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua. Take thou this vial, being then in bed, and this distilling liquor drink thou off. I'll send my letters to thy lord post haste to Mantua.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
I come for my lady Juliet.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Amen
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
Ay me!
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Do you really think so?
Now there's the Deirdre I know.
It's been known to happen.
I feel as if I've wandered onto the set of Enter The Dragon.  Could you teach me to do that?
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
I intend to.  This phone is wired like no other: it's got an encryption chip and instant sat-a-link recognition, it can talk to any computer in any language and make it understand.  With my custom hardware and this phone I can trace the target's cell phone signature and follow him anywhere he goes...
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Where's the case?
Don't do it, Sam!
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
There's been a slight problem.
So none of us knows who's paying the freight, this is just some anonymous job. For all we know, we're working for different people.
Sent it where?
I just wanted to make sure you knew who you were dealing with.
I didn't expect that he would.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
Long enough to shoot back.
Where is this broad?
Cigarette?
Something like that...
What'd you say to him?
That was a nice move you did on our young friend.  Judo?
I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
I do.
So, Vincent: why bring me along for the ride?  Job like this calls for a warm body, somebody who can stand around and look threatening.  A tough guy.
I wonder if she truly left the IRA.
Know what?
That there was a gun pointed at me.
It was at that.
He's going back.
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Alright, it's done.
You see the bullet?
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I don't know...
Give me a cigarette.
Business keeps you on the road?
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Do you have a good answer?
Let's get him out of here...
I told you, I quit.
What's the story?
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
I'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  Did you get ID off any of them?
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
Don't spend it all in one place.
Suppose someone knows about the money?  They're bound to ask questions.
It's no accident we stumbled on this money.  It's an answer to a prayer!  Every night and every day I've prayed that God would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  Tonight my prayer came true.
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
I'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  We can't risk it.
Okay then.  I'll do it.
I tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Are you nuts?  They'll fry us for sure.  There's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  No way.
I should have known something like this was going to happen!
I can't do that.
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Dwayne's dead.
Uh huh.
What's your offer, Jesse?
I'm all ears.
I have to go to the bank before it closes.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Nothing.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
Nothing happened?
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I love you Sally.
I don't know.  My friends...
Yeah, I guess you're right.  It's just...all so sudden...
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Test the product?
What do you think about all this?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Uh, no...
What are you getting at?
Anything...specific?
Shopping here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
Something wrong, Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
Dwayne put the gun down --
Hey we're all friends, right? Friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what Jesse Segundo is all about.
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
What?
Well you're not getting, either.
So I want the money and I want it now.
Hi ma.
There was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, I forget, so I figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Well I don't know --
We retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
Yeah, we did.  It was unleaded, high octane.
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Is it true, Carter?  Are you in Hong Kong right now?
Those are five hundred dollar chips.
No, I just assumed...
Winner!  Four, winner!
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
I knew it.  The guy's name is Zing.  He works at the kitchen at Reign Plaza.
I don't think so.
This is your ship?
Yeah, that's right.
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
So what's your story?
Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong?
Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
She said I could pick any girl I want.
Well, hurry up.
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese.
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
IT IS CRAZY!
It sounds impossible --
Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign.
Who?
How do you know he's our man?
Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
How do you know?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
Get it out of here!
Are you okay?
What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
See you in the next world.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
I think we should stop talking.
It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
No Chinese man discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
What is Mac out?
Try to keep them busy for five minutes.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No you didn't!
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.
We made it, man.
First class.
Why don't you go get them?
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to...
Escort Detective Carter to the airport --
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
You don't move, you understand?!  You don't move!
Help me Rhonda.
You're full of shit.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you? Full of shit?
Right....
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
Did you make the plate?!
It was a man I was after in Hong Kong.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
Are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  Come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
Yes, I know this song.
You're killin' me here.
Hey, baby, it's cool.  Captain just reassigned me to the Feds.
What's wrong with that?
Oh baby, don't worry, I'll call you. You can count on it.
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You don't like it?
Yeah. So why you look do down?
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
Yes.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
Han?
You have what I asked for?
You look awful.
Or a vegetarian?
Look, he's running after her.
Okay, we'll order out.
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
We'll see.
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Seven-fifty.
Six-fifty.
Maybe someday.
Always a mood killer.
Highly suspect.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
Excuse me?
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Yes, I did.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
It's probably because you got him fired.
Where?
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Grandma!
No, I'm just going to head home.
A harmless joke.
Yeah.
You take the microwave?
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system.  Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Am I what they had in mind?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
Is that all right with you?
I'll wait.
Walter, I'd love to --
Miss Scarlett.  In the broom closet.  With the radio.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
What?
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
It was my mother's.
You okay?
About what?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
What?
Turn on your radio!
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
Becky?
Honey, he wasn't right for you.
I'm Jonah.  That's my dad.  His name is Sam.
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Howard.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Are his folks nice?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
It's a sign.
Sure you do.
Hi.
Have you had any relationship since?
I don't think I could really describe it.
It's not that late in Seattle.
You don't like the one he was now?
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
Why not?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
They met at the Empire State Building, only they didn't. Never mind.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
Write her.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
Not.
Does red pepper go under R or P?
So I can go.
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
It doesn't.  They ask you.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I'm starting to forget her.
Her name is Annie.  Annie Reed.
Dad!
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here.  You'll have a swell time.  You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
What's wrong with Annie?
No.
No.
Do you like baseball?
What about it?
I went camping once.  I love to brush my teeth in a brook and floss with a weed.
Hi.  Sam?
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
No way.  No way I was going to be the first woman you went out with after...  There is no percentage whatsoever in being the first woman anyone goes out with after...
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Oh.
Is he there?
No.  After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry.  He had an uncanny sense of timing.  We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
I mean it. I know your work record. You were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you up. And now they'll sell you down the river. Why don't you wake up, Ray?  That's your name, isn't it, Ray?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
Whose side are you on anyway?
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
Got any more ideas?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
Antonio paid for it.
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What makes you so sure?
Over my dead body.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Be still ...
Ramón -- you can't.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
What are you saying?
Hear those deputies slugged 'Cente.
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
You know I don't think that.
No ...
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
I know, it's wrong. Just let me go. I'll leave town ... just let me go.
Bobby?
Not even a guess?
I can't.
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
I can't leave.
Then why don't you leave?  Just give me one good reason.
What happened to your eye?
: What are you up to?
What do you want from me, Colette?
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
It gets me through the day.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
You don't like the tune, find another station.
He knows where I work.
I knew that if these were the guys I was looking for, I'd have to set up a deal so sweet, they wouldn't be able to walk away from it.
Maybe I am dealing with it.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
Where to?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Business.  I need to leave town and I find myself in dire need of some cash.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
You wanna score some go-fast?
You want a hit?
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
By not disgracing her memory!
You don't understand.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Anything for a dear friend.
Garcetti thinks I'm a pile of shit.
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
Yeah.  What about him?
Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Again, I thank you.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
Tom, quit fucking around.
First you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  Which is it?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
What is it, drugs?
Casualties?
So they travel around from place to place and preach?
Jackson?
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Fuck Private James Ryan, fuck him, just fuck the goddamned son-of-a- bitch.
Me?  I'm walking with my hound, Lucy, it's about an hour 'fore sunrise and we're out huntin' coon.  I got me a flask of pure Kentucky mash whiskey...
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.
Watching.
You see, I've got the best house in all of Addley.  It's not the biggest house, but it's got the best location, right next to the junior high baseball field.  The garage windows face left field.  The guy who owned the house before me had these heavy screen S put over them.  The first thing I did when I bought the place was take off those screens.  Two-hundred-twenty- two yards from home plate to my garage windows.  It takes a hell of a junior high kid to hit a ball that far.  I look at my garage windows as a Motivator and a way to scout the kids coming up, the ones who are going to give us a shot at the state championship.  I lay there in my hammock and every time I hear the sound of breaking glass, I know we're one step closer to winning it all.
It seemed appropriate.
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
What about Talbot?
A fucking mess, two maybe three Kraut divisions, no fronts, no lines, the drops were completely fouled up, we've got little pockets of paratroopers all over the place, trying to hang on.  Command says we hold St. Mere, but north of that, it's all Krauts.  Even if Ryan's where he's supposed to be, he's more than likely dead.
Hell of a mission.
Nope.
Three for three.
Pulls Wade's hands from the wound. Pours sulfa powder.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
I think you're right, Keith.
You know Wade was the eleventh of the twelve, you're the last one still alive.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
You're welcome, John.
What are we going to do?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Trust me, you're the best.
Sure, Reiben.
Huh?
Maybe.  But what if he dies on the way back?  you see what I'm saying, sir?  The best possible situation is, he's dead, we find his body, more or less intact, we grab one of his dog-tags and high-tail it back to the beach, or better yet, we head over to Caen and catch up with division.
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
What deal?
I'd like to go, sir.
Is jumped on by one.  Upham FIRES. KILLS the German.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Reiben, you can be very unpleasant to be around sometimes.
Frogs?
So, where are you from?
Speak with my lawyer.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake.  I have people here.
Why would you stay so long with an operation that is so clearly not a growth enterprise?
Lloyd?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Yes.
Alright.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
One hundred and twenty-five thousand and nine months.
I can accept that.
I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
What?
I just had a phone call.
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
You won it.  You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
You should be.
You're going.
Diane!  Alright, let's stop this right now.  Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous.  This isn't even smart thinking.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
'I like him'?  Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
What am I supposed to think?
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I'm so ashamed dad.
Hello.
Mom, please?
Hi.  You called me?
Yeah.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well, not monumentally.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
Goodbye.
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Sure I do.
What?
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
What did you say?
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
No.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
We decided...
It sounded like you did.
No, I don't, I don't.
What?
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Seriously, Lloyd.
No, really.
I know
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.
Oh boy.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
Ooop, excuse me.
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
Itzhak Stern?  He's on the list.
Sir, the list is correct.
You know what, you'd like her.
What?
Should I stay?
In Breslau.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
I just told you.
You asked for shoe polish.
Ghetto Police.  I'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
God bless you, sir.
How you feeling, all right?
Yeah.
Good.  How's it going?
What others?
Get the contracts and I'm sure you'll do very well.  In fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  It was a "pleasure."
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
And killing.
It's got nothing to do with reality, Oskar, I know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  It's got a ritual significance to them, Jews shoveling snow.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
Would it do any good?
We don't know if it's random. We haven't been able to connect the victims.
He's broken his pattern.
You're sure about this two person thing?
Stop it...
Who is this?
What do you want from me, Cotton?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
This is exactly what I don't want.
Yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
He hates Oliver Stone.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
We have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
So what made you change your mind about Sidney?
Not good. How you doin?
You broke my heart.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Who are you?
I don't play games.
What do you mean?
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
He tried to kill her first.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Oh, Sid, you’re sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
The young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
How many guys they have on you?
I've been waiting for you, baby.
Easy black boy.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
I hate scary movies.
I'll be right back.
Melinda McGraw?
What?!
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
Who?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
Because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer.  And I know how to handle guys like that.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Where are you Dewey?
They've got her!
Watch out Sid. Randy said the killer's always superhuman.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
You're not a detective.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
What the hell are you guys getting at?  I make horror films, that's what I do.  The Studio came to me with 'Stab'.  They came to me, check it out.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter.
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Just because you knew her?
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
Listen, I have no time for this. I've heard this shit before! So lets get on with it!
Why don't we just read the scene?  Candy, is that like candy cane or candy apple?
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
It's not just a new script, it's a new movie.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
No.
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
Don't do it!  If you do one thing to attract attention, one thing, I'll kill them both. Now, do you have somewhere we can be alone?
Where?
WHERE?
Hello?
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Dude. What are you doing here?
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
It's on the table.
You rode your bike out there?
What are you doing here?
You know what my dad will do to you?
Understand what? That I got a girlfriend who would rather accuse me of being a psychopathic killer than touch me.
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
You lost your mom...
Oh Sidney...
Are you serious?
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
Who are you trying to reach?
Do I?
To apologize.
You're forgiven. Bye now.
Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't think so.
What did you say?
Yes?
To talk.
You getting scared?
What do you want?
Don't do this. I can't...
No it's not. It was Jason.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
No, not yet.
You never know when or where a story will break.
Did you reach my Dad?
I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him.
Keeping my eye on Sidney.
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
How's the book?
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
You're evil.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
So who are you?
The question is not who am I. The question is where am I?
So where are you?
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Is Billy going to be there tonight?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
No way.
I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage.
How's that?
... envy, sloth, pride and lust.  Seven.
I heard.
We figure you need all the tools you can get to fix up that piece of shit you call a house.
Where was the girl?
What?  What?
Turn around.  Hands on your head!
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
What's so exciting?
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
You should be thanking me.
You're going to be remembered, and it's all because of me.  And, the only reason I'm here right now is because I wanted to be.
You've made a good life for yourself...
I'm a little thrown.  I just got in town like twenty minutes ago and they dumped me here.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
No one yet.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?
It could be nothing.
You go to movies at least?
No fingerprints?
Nothing.
No witnesses of any kind?
There must be something.
What?
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
What?  Assessing fines?
Modern Homicide Investigation.  In Cold Blood.  Of Human Bondage.  Human Bondage?
Then, he must write about these murders.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Just know that in this case there's not going to be any satisfaction.  If we caught John Doe and he were the devil himself, if it turned out he were actually Satan, then, that might live up to our expectations.  No human being could do these things, right? But, this is not the devil.  It's just a man.
You think you're preparing me for the hard times ahead?  You think you're toughening me up?  Well, you're not!  You're quitting, fine... but I'm staying.
Stay with him.
Wait!
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Did the wife confess?
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Amen!...Put an 'amen' to it!
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
I don't care what they've done to you...what happened...
I've come now...
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Are you sure they didn't die of carbine shots fired by a bunch o' Yank bluebellies so scared they couldn't tell the difference between a Cheyenne and a Comanche?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Easy on that!
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
That don't make 'em kin...
Oh...
Nine...  Ten!
Go on! Get out of here while you can...
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
There's one thing. We recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff...trade goods...Couldn't help noticing that most of it was Mexican...Maybe if you could talk to some of those Mexican traders along the border...What do they call themselves?
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
I got your boy killed.
You ever see it before...like mebbe on a dress Debbie wore?
The <U>late</U> Mister Futterman?
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
They say it's fantastic.  At least that's what I read in a men's magazine.  So who are the two lucky ones?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
I miss Tommi so much.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
Martin, what-
Ellen.
Hammer?
Ned…I know…I know
Thank you, my lady!
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Twenty pounds on delivery
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
Words, words, words…once, I had the gift…I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones…for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery…but now
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Put his feet in.
And his ears.
This time we take your boots off!
Very well.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started.  You have begun?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
What? Who?
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I liked the dog, for laughs.
Well-monied is the same as well-born and well-married is more so. Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
What do you love so much?
As stories must when love's denied--with tears and a journey. Those whom God has joined in marriage, not even I can put asunder.
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the play- house--go make your farewell and send her out. It's time to settle accounts.  How much was the wager?
"…All my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay, And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Master Shakespeare
"Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purg'd."
"Ay me."
But the plague
Who are you, master?
Who is there?
Even your play.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
My lady Viola.
He is dead?
No, sir.
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.
I … Her letter came to me by the nurse.
Your aunt?
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
She sings too?
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
What of her bosom?
Oh!--it's--it's--oh, it's a house of ill- repute!
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
All right, just a few questions.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
You're a bad loser.
No.
You mean immoral.
He's still here.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
Nothing.
Looking for you? Yes.
Who?
Where do you think you'll go?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.
Well?
I've never seen any of these men before.
Take another look at these two.
Well, is it?
That's it, then.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Yes, thanks.
Cameron?
Yes.
His car's still there.
So?
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
I don't want to. It's different.
Are you all right?
Once it's spent you won't have to worry about it.
Oh, good.
Forget it.
Where he can't get it?
Now you thought of that, not me.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Interesting.
So, uh...
Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
No one. I promise.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.
Sorry?
But they sneer, don't they?
Oh, I see, I thought you meant --
Here?.
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to come in?
And that's not the same thing?
It's up to you. Air Patagonia. New outfit: via Caracas and Bogot . No catering. Four hundred and eleven pounds. Four one one. Good value, but refueling at Bogot  is variable.
I suppose so.
Offering it for debate.
I don't know, I think...
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Then what's the problem?
Who?
That kid... the hairdresser.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
I just thought you'd like to know --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- is that what this is all about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Thanks a lot.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
I'll be back in a while.
You're late, George.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I can see that.
You're looking great, baby.
What about?
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
It isn't?
I guess so.
Yeah.
Well, are you?
What?
You are.
You promised you'd do the show.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
No, thanks.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Why not?
Hey, I don't tell.
George...
You were great.
You don't think so? I do.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Am I entertaining you?
We're friends.
-- where'd you go?
-- very nice, very nice.
-- we are?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
No --
-- please, please forgive me...
-- left my bag, didn't have no money...
-- took a bus.
-- yes, George.
Not yet.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
There were some shots.
Will we live together?
You've never even been around one.
Great.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
George.
Okay.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
No, but I think they might.
Right now?
I'll call you.
Look at the way I live.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
I wish you'd go now.
What did you say?
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
It's good you want to do something, George.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
What do they look like?...
Now wait a minute...
But...
I wanna hear about it.
I wanna hear about it, George.
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
Have a drink.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
What about her?
She's nothing but a whore.
What took you so long?


Is that right?
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
Here.
No.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
So what's your point?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Jackie --
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Well, there was this one time --
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Johnny!
I'm terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
-- there's not much room --
Jill.
You seem disappointed.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No, it's not that...
No!
Yes.
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?
Are you sure?
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never... You know that, don't you, huh?
Chocolate.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
Jack...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Now Danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
Now I'm going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  Okay?
Have you been in Boulder long, Mrs. Torrance?
How did he manage to do that?
Sure.
Yes, sir.
Eh... Mr. Grady... weren't you once the caretaker here?
He is, Mr. Torrance.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
I fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, Mr. Torrance.  I fear that is the only thing to do.
Sure.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
No, we don't mind.
Good.
Bill, how do you do?
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
No charge?
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
What time is it?
It's really pretty outside.  How about taking me for a walk after you've finished your breakfast?
Yes.
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me.
Go away.
I'm Jack Torrance.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Hi.
What's the money for?
Where's Mom?
Went shopping. Why?
You all right, Marty?
No.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
I'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. And I'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to Mr. Haller.
After Marty called me with his latest Thrilling Tale of Wonder, I did.  He's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
Mr. Haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? No one sees him again!
What if I say no?
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
You know what we're saying!
SING!
Okay, Christy -- strip.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
You are so damn sexy.
What, Vincent?  This is me, doll.  I know you.  What did you think you were doing?  Running to the cops.  Hiding out. No, no.  You're sorry now, aren't you?
This prom is a real drag.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
Isn't it a glorious morning?  Good morning, Mary Clarence.  sleep well?
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
You see?  We've got the voices.  They're just allover the place. I've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. Better than me.  We just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
Two days.  An hour or so.
Hurry, Sister!
Pay attention...
SING AND THE DEVIL WILL FLEE!
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
She's a pro.
A cigarette?
Three years.  Sister.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
What was all that?  Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
Are you leaving us?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
What? 
What?
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
Is this all the food I get?
Yes.  Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
Really catching on.
Months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
And if I don't?
Nuns, Eddie.  There are nuns here. Everywhere.  It's crawling with 'em.
Like what?
What if I was Vince?  You'd be dead right now.  What are you doing giving interviews on TV?
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
What?
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
I think they'd understand.
Yeah, Eddie, thanks a whole bunch. Thanks for sticking me in a convent.  So you think, after all this, maybe I really am a nun?
Oh-huh.
Then one day they find you.
But, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
A sweater.
What's she doing?
We've got to save her!
She told us about one.  The Little Sisters of the Moonlight.  In Las Vegas.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
Excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
I don't understand.  Where is she?
She's... she's a nun.
How did you hear this?
They spend two days in chains.
No bleeding.
I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place.
What?
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Maybe you should take this.
There is a farming community upstate, Constable... ten days journey north in the Hudson Highlands.  It is named Sleepy Hollow.  Within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. Each with their head lopped cleanly off.  The elders of the Hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, I have chosen you.
What is that you wear?
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
Out there.  What do you see?
Thank you.
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
Why... why are you like this?
How are you?
Forgive me, I didn't know.
Other people?
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
What are you on about?
There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
If you want me to go, I will.  Do you want me to leave?
Katrina.  Why do you follow?
What are you doing?
What... what are you doing... ?
I have not been able to face him yet.
Katrina...
The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
Go home.
No, don't guess I do.  Scooter, good to meet you.  This is him, the one I talked to you about on the phone. Now like I said, I'll understand if you get nervous about it. I'm not gonna lie to you now, he did get in that trouble but then he was real young.
I'll see you, Bill.
Can I help you?
What do you like to eat here?
French fries. I like to eat them pretty good.
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
Yeah.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
Please Doyle, don't.
Leave.
Leave.
Naw, hell, let them stay here with me and do men things. There might be some kind of ball game on we can watch. You go on.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
I hate you!
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
I know Albert. We're friends.
Childers.
Don't hit that boy no more.
I told you to get away from here, didn't I? I'm tryin' to relax and look at TV.  What are you doin' with that piece of iron? I swear to God you're the weirdest son of a bitch I ever heard of.
But maybe just for awhile --
What's you last name?
Did you want to play ball with us?
He never did want to. I figure he ain't changed his mind much.
How did your mama die?
Karl.  You know when I said daddy got hit by a train.
Two people.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Where'd you get them flowers?
Naw. You can look at all my books you want to.
That's than un on Christmas I was tellin' you about.
You want to go with me?
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Yeah, I recollect it.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Pull on your works. Your privates.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
No sir.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
I'm tired, too, Frank.  If I ain't around no more, it don't mean I don't care fer ye. I care for ye a good deal. I care for you more than anybody they is. We made friends right off the bat.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
Did Vaughan go home?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
Naw.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
I didn't aim to.
Two fellers was on a bridge a takin' a leak and one feller says the water was cold and the other said it was deep water. One of 'em came from Arkansas, I believe.
Thank ye.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Naw, I ain't.
Well that's a very offensive way to put it. You shouldn't say that. You were taught that, weren't you?
Oh. How about before that?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Good. I haven't decided yet if I'm a good cook.
I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not San Quentin, it's just a nuthouse. Most of these people don't even know where they are, they're not gonna hurt you.
My name's Jerry Woolridge.
Y'all have a seat. Is this all of you?
You see, Karl, growing up, only knew that sex was wrong and that people who did it should be killed for it. He couldn't really read but, well, neither could his mother. But, his father made sure that his mother knew what the Bible said. And she made sure Karl knew. You know he slept in a hole in the ground under a toolshed, right?
Signs?
Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
Not an easy book.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
I didn't know you took pictures.
I guess you could call it a hobby. It doesn't take me more than about five minutes a day to do it, but I do it every day. Rain or shine, sleet or snow. Sort of like the postman.  Sometimes it feels like my hobby is my real job, and my job is just a way to support my hobby.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
That's what people see, but that ain't necessarily what I am.
They're all the same.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Every word.
I lied to her, and then I stole from her. I don't see how you can call that a good deed.
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
I know what it means. That still don't make it a good name.
That's what you told me when I shoplifted that necklace for you. You remember, baby, don't you? The judge gave me a choice: either go to the can or enlist. So, instead of going to college, I wind up in the navy for four years, I watch men lose their arms and legs, I nearly get my head blown off, and you, sweet Ruby McNutt, you run off and marry that asshole, Bill.
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
Yeah, well, I lost my pen. By the time I got a new one, I was clean out of paper.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Fuck this angel shit. Just take the dough, Ruby. But no bawling, okay? I can't stand people who blubber.
How long you been working for me, Auggie?
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I almost got married once.
Enjoy it while you can, Vin. Pretty soon, they're going to legislate us out of business anyway.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
It's the law that's buying. That's what's so beautiful about it. I mean, when was the last time you heard of a judge sending himself to jail?
I'll be back in about an hour. Watch the register while I'm gone, okay?
No, it's five thousand dollars.
Shit. I don't want your money, you little twerp.  It's probably stolen anyway.
... If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Do you understand what I'm saying? You never know what's going to happen next, and the moment you think you know, that's the moment you don't know a goddamn thing. That's what we call a paradox. Are you following me?
Of course it hurts. What does it look like?
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
You mean Rashid?
I was about to get run over by a car, and your nephew pulled me back. He saved my life.  I sensed he was in trouble, so I offered to put him up for a few days. Maybe I should have pressed him a little more, I don't know. I feel pretty stupid about it now.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
It's rundown, all right. But drawing a picture won't improve the way it looks.  Let's see what you did, Rembrandt.
I just tell it like it is, mister.  If I'm getting on your nerves, though, you might want to think about hiring me.
I'm afraid we'll be working on a strictly freelance basis.
And have you mended them?
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
It's only temporary. On a freelance basis.
You have to let me do something for you to put the scales in balance.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast.  Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes.  Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias. 
I didn't ask to come here. You invited me, remember?  If you want me to leave, all you have to do is say so.
Three nights.
Where the hell do you think you're going?
If you don't sleep, you don't dream. If you don't dream, you don't have nightmares.
Celebrate? What for?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Six thousand dollars. Five thousand eight hundred and fourteen dollars, to be exact.
That money is my whole future.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
Well?
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
I'm not going to do it.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
That's obvious.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
Why?  If they could never take title.
Second question.  What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
A thousand.
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Then putting them together.  So truth is revealed.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
That's when he fell.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Cigarette?
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately.  This one's new.
Right.  In the middle.  Of the floor.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Does it now?
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
Sure, anything's poss...
Not in those words.
Spirit?                          Oh!  You mean "AQ"..."aggressive qualities"?
Listen, doll - what time do you get off tonight?
Wanna see my driver's license?
Upsy-daisy.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
Same faces - same instruments -  - and here's your Valentine's card.
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
As far away as possible.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
Who are we kidding?  Look at that - look how she moves - it's like jello on springs - they must have some sort of a built-in motor. I tell you it's a whole different sex.
What are you afraid of?  Nobody's asking you to have a baby.  This is just to get out of town. The minute we hit Florida, we'll blow this set-up.
This way, Daphne.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
I got pinched in the elevator.
Blow where?
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
You - you -
Of course, you're not.  I'm going.
Come on, you can do better than that. Give him teeth - the whole personality.
I am.
Jerry!  You can't be serious!
Oh.
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
That's some nerve!
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Not that, you idiot.
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
All right - so what do we do now?
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
OH!
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You got some?
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
What do you think you're doing?
I recognized him too - his picture was in Vanity Fair.
How did you get that bracelet?
Yes, I'm holding on.
Yes, indeed.  It's cost my family quite a bit of money.
I'm not surprised.
You must be quite a girl.
Please.  It won't happen again.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
You know something, Mr. Fielding? You're dynamite!
I don't care.
And I have a terrible past.  For three years now, I've been living with a saxophone player.
We'll adopt some.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
What's the job?
Because I got some plans -
Well, here we are.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Really?
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
Every time!
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
You're entitled.
I want mine to wear glasses.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.
414 - that's the same room number I had in Cincinnati - my last time around with a male band. What a heel he was.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
My fault.
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
I quite agree.  Tell me, who runs up that flat - your wife?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
How's the stock market?
Up, up, up.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
Maybe I'll tell you when I know you a little better.  What are you doing tonight?
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
You collect shells?
Yes.  So did my father and my grandfather - we've all had this passion for shells - that's why we named the oil company after it.
It's been delightful meeting you both.
I just got this motorboat - it's an experimental model.
What a beautiful fish.
A herring?  Isn't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars?
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
See?  Nothing.
You mean you can't fall in love?
Yes.  Eight hours later they brought her up by mule - I gave her three transfusions - we had the same blood type - Type O - it was too late.
Talk about sad.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
Yes.  Now about our date for tonight...
I'm afraid not.  I can't make it tonight.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
But you have.  You've given me all that inside information - first thing tomorrow I'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil.
I don't believe I've seen you at any of our services before.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Except it’s Scotch.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why, with you.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
Oh, shut up. You’re an optician.
I didn’t deserve her back then.
Nothing, nothing.
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
So, what’s your point?
Hi. Hey.
Mission accomplished.
Mmm.
You quitting?
What is?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Would you grab my shampoo?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
You have had girlfriends?
So, why’d you say yes to me?
And that’s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Hey, Sal.
You pawned it.
You want me to let him in?
Yeah.
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
Here it is, right here.
And the other people you told me 'bout, they is all colored folk?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois. 
You're a friendly lady, Miss Johnson.
I been like that myself, when I thought nobody was gonna believe me...  You wanna hear another story?!
Yes mam...
Yes, mam...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
:His visit with his father at the County Jail house --
He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
You hurt, Daddy!?
Do you know my daddy, Nathan Lee Morgan?
That's right!
Can I go when the holiday comes?
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
You know where my father is, don't you, Miss Boatwright?
No, he was wrong, David, I didn't find out.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Mama, what was we laughin' for?
Whatcha wanta order?
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Montana.
Pillow.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
That's right, Mr. Garrison. The environment is what surrounds us. It is what we live and breathe.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Man, that movie gets better every time I see it!
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
Your behind?
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Hey, Chef.
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Oops, I guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
May I?
Donkey raping shit eater.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Aw, ma!!
Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you stand watch here and await my return. If any guards come by, make a sound like a dying giraffe.
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
That was sweet!
Nowhere.
Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance and Phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!
Yeah, so what do we say?
Oh, brother.
Thank you, Kenny.
I knew this would happen! Those bastard Canadians have now killed a child! Can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
You're all part of Satan's army now!
And I thought my mother was the master of guilt.  Geez Louise.
No, it was worse than that...
Uh, we're just, starting our program...
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!
Hello, Conan!
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
You just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  I told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
What did you do today Satan?
Well I just want you to be impressed with what I <u>do</u>. I want you to respect my MIND.
Can we talk about this later?  Everyone is watching!
Ow, you're hurting me!
Hi Wendy.
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
My friend the clitoris told me.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.
Well, I guess she figures she's paying for it.
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Why, didn't they say?
Man, I'm hungry.  I'm going to call the steward, you want anything?.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Like open an airlock by mistake?
Well I don't think there's a chance of that happening.  It's usually the moon walks.  Sometimes you feel like a kindergarten teacher.
We don't.
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Can't we access the mainframe to check the ship's condition?
OK...it's open.
Why can't we?
You're ready for the real thing?
Sure.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Hopefully sooner than later.
We have room!  Let's go!
What do you mean?  What happened!
I never thought this would happen.  No premonitions, nothing.
I'm fine.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
There's no time to explain.  Get everyone together!  We found a way to the pods!
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
You a mini-golfer?
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
Sorry about your loss.
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
Hey, you still here?
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
Bowling police, step back, give him room.
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
Need some advice, huh.
100 years! 
Remember the finals in Akron in '59? You had a seven-ten split in the final frame.
It's mine.
You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
It's the next level, the next dimension...  ...the small ball.
If the Japanese are pansies, then pansies are my kind of people. Sheila steps over to the booth with their food. The Buzz Burger has three holes cut in the middle to make it look like a bowling ball. Buzz sees the two sleazeballs park their car and walk towards the diner.
You have no right to call yourself a bowler. Buzz slaps Theo in the face.
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
What about bowling?
Thanks, kid.  Where are you goin' now?
I'm goin' straight. No more short cuts. Theo gets into the car. Buzz leans in the open window.
I found dad.
Don't tell me, John.
You're prone to violent outbursts, aren't you?
JUNIOR!  You're supposed to say JUNIOR WHO! I'm going to have to hurt you. Theo and Junior circle one another.
You shouldn't touch her.
You played bouncy-bouncy with Sheila, so I'm gonna play Blue-Face with you. 
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
There's a lot of competition for amusement out there. You gotta adapt to survive.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
Do you know where they're taking him?
I think that a motorbike is one of the last really free things that people can do.
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Kinda tough on the butt.
Nothing.
So why do you stay?
What are you going to do about your brother?
Nothing.
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
It's Junior, isn't it.
I can't - I can't do it.  He's my brother.
You told Junior that we did it.
We would have sooner or later.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?
You should.
Now he's the one who's locked up and I'm the one who's free. If I gotta do this alone, I might as well start now. She revs up and peals out.
What makes you think you know me so well that you can give me an ultimatum? Huh?
You're really pissing me off.
What about plan C?
Some unfinished business.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Fletcher!  Now!
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Hold on --
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Direction's east coming!
Thirty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
You talk to any reporters?  Any press?
A cyclone's on it's way in.  I thought they would have told you on the phone.
Hold on --
All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
She should've known better.
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
We don't have anything else to try, Sir.
They've left, keep watching!
I did.
So how do we get it open?
So?  What's the problem?
How can he be missing?
Wait -- down where?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
It never occurred to me.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made.  Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
... when I was six, my younger brother and I -- we went swimming in the Pacific.  At my mother's beach house.  We both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. Killed him.
Yeah, it was awful.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
I can't feel her bones.  She's like a sponge.
Norman.
Where did you get this?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Don't do this.
My air isn't... I'm coming back.
Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad.
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
Manifested?
Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry.
But how?
I don't know.
I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
Riordan?
Antihistamine.  For bites.
How fast does it take effect?
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
What is it, Norman?
Where are you?
Your watch.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Are you manifesting them?
No, he can't.
Is it?
But I have to, Norman.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth can get you?  Some more chicken, perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.
He doesn't wait for an answer.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
You're staring at me.
C'mon, Norman.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
I can't believe that, Harry.
Am I?
No.  I didn't say that.
... you there?  Norman?
Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it --
What do you mean?  She's not here?
Hold on.
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
No idea.
How's that working out, by the way?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
What is it, Harry?
Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't...
Meaning?
Arrived?  From where?
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
Huh?
You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there?
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Was it a military crash?
How much do you think she's talking about?
I'll get the information.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
Good morning!
What do you mean, 'good morning'? Do you mean that it is a good morning for you, or do you wish me a good morning, although it is obvious I'm not having one, or do you find that mornings in general are good?
I know your intentions.  I probably know much more about you than you realize.  In many ways you're a lot like your father.  He was an indulgent man, but a clever warrior.  Now what brings you out here?
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
What is it?
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
We don't get many visitors.  Let's take a look at it.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?
You've been in the Counter Wars?... Against the Empire?
That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my meaning...
I can't make it.  You go on, master Luke.  It doesn't make sense for you to risk yourself on my account.  I'm done for.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
I read you sir.
You're back.  What happened?  Never mind.  What's going on?
You rich kids... are all the same !
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn't want that ?
Bugs laid a trap, didn't they ?
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Hey ! What are you doing here ?
You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier, and she said...
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Johnny, wait...
Yeah.
Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
None at all... We won.
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
He's nothing like you.
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
Do you mean it ?
It's funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits me, and I can't stop crying.
...I'm sorry.
We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and Fleet can't be bothered to spit.
That was just a mix up.
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Where'd it come from ?
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
Flip six, three hole.
If they didn't want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
Way to go, amigo !
Diz, see what you can do.
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
Oh, my, what's that ?
I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.
Please complete this sentence. I want to be citizen because...
Let's go.
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
What is it, Rico ?
I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have what it take to be a citizen.
Yes, sir !
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
The carbon-units are not responsible for that.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
... but I still recommend further simulation study.
Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications.
Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
Mr. Decker... I will contact you every five minutes. Otherwise... inform Mr. Scott immediately.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
Lieutenant Ilia reporting for duty, sir.
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Transmit, Mr. Spock! Now!
Let it drop, Bones.  You are my Science Officer -- I'll expect an <U>immediate</U> report on anything further you learn or <U>sense</U> from here on.
We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
No meaning... No hope...  And, Jim, no answers...! Jim, it's looking for <U>answers</U> <U>itself</U>!
Not for us?
Spock, we <U>were</U> its answer!
Yes, Captain. It needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...
Cal...
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
I quit.
I just got kicked off my first movie.
It's about life.
Could you tell me when's the next train?
Ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
I understand...
Well, I guess I'll...get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
How can you <u>say</u> that?
...lost the screw...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Then I'll come back, then.
Oh <u>okay</u>.
But it's absurd.
Because it's about <u>purity</u>...
Is it...
It does?
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
Not without a rolltop desk.
But it'll stop the movie.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Morning, darling.
Hi!
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
No.  Don't tell me that.
I'm sorry.
It'll hurt the box office.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm <u>bleeding</u>...
I will.
...they run on water.
Fourteen year old girls.
Uh, <u>look</u>....
...I was just talking to that girl in the other room.
You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Are you all right...?
He's saying, what are you saying, Bobby?
You can go...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I'm very sorry to...
Well.  What seems to be the...?
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
I think he's moved...
An artist of your caliber...
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
...I just swore my life away, back in that...
Main Street.
She was in the car with Bob Barrenger last night.  And she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
I'm looking for the writer.
How about that.
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
I had a witness I would.
Who's White...?
I'm very sorry I...
It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I know you do.
I don't drink.
I can't.
You want me to lie.
I'm out.
You can't write it?
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
IT'S A COMPUTER COMANY...IT'S A COMPUTER COMPANY, <u>BAZOOMER</u>-<u>COM</u>?
NO NO NO NO NO, PAY HER OFF.  DID YOU HEAR ME?
We got the permit.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
...not at all...
...the city council...
He's been playin' Old Farmer nigh on sixty years.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Where are we?
I hate when you say that.
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Mom?  What's wrong?
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.
I'll miss you so much.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
That doesn't bother me.
I <u>did</u> what she said.  I <u>used</u> my words, I <u>told</u> him what I <u>felt</u>, and they...
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
Oh.  It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to.  But it's real.  Does he have an older brother?
There you are!
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Why does Rachel wear Daddy's underpants? Doesn't she have underpants of her own?
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together.  <u>Hate</u>.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
Rachel's job is she works.
What honey?
Rache says it's from you.
Can I talk to you?  When you're there.
Are you here?
We're not discussing your age.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother?
What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Maybe the problem is your <u>kids</u>.  Maybe they're spoiled, coddled <u>brats</u>!
I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
She already hates me.  You've seen to that.
I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
I'm sorry, I just...
She was angry at herself.
I don't, but...
See, I know that.
I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
It's the same choice you made.
I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term.
And her...?
Looks nice enough to m...
Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course...
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh?  You die young, you always look golden.  Perfect.  The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 <u>seconds</u>, you could find him from a <u>coma</u>, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds.  You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Okay, if they're going to <u>have</u> a sauce, put something <u>in</u> it besides flour and chicken broth...
So I'll have to order in?
We have the kids this weekend, so...
Look.  I know they hate me.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
They're my kids.
Can we go sit somewhere?
Oh.
Marty, ignore him.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Great to be here.
Well, I was thinking...I might work for you.
Yes, Mikey?
Poison gas.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
Why was he on Death Row?
Sure!...
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
But what kind of pull did you have?
Yeah?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Mom, it's not fair if Brady can say the f-word and I can't.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Any books you like to read for fun?
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Who is this?
Oh, fine. How are you?
But...you called.
Yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so I dropped out.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
How many?
You a pervert?
Well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of Columbine.
But what did you get on your SATs?
What do you think?
Looks like you're not going to make that dinner after all...
I don't want any...
She's still alive.
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
This was taken when Richter was arrested in Washington state, 1985. He was charged with interstate arms trafficking, skipped bail, and has since been a fugitive.
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Are you hungry?  We can discuss some final arrangements over some slop in the galley.
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
They must have got their hands on a test vial!
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
I know nothing of the sort!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Premier Belch will not be fooled by this fantastic lie.
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
You mean you'll tell us his name???
That's right, fella.
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
Okay, fella.  But just move slow and don't do anything that might surprise me.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
Operator...How much would the call be station-to-station?...Thirty-five cents cheaper?...I'd still be short twenty cents ...Just a second, operator...  Colonel, shoot the lock off the Coke machine.  There's bound to be enough change in there.
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.
That's a very wise deduction, General.
Why do you think I ask?
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
All right, Major.  I'm putting the base on condition Red.
You're right, sir.
Plan-R????
No, sir.  I'm just bringing the facts to your attention, sir.
Yes, sir.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
And a condition red means enemy attack in progress, doesn't it?
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
How much soda, sir.
That about right?
Well, General -- I was wondering, why are you doing this?  I mean why do you want to start the war?
I've given it alot of thought, Major.  Don't think I haven't.
I'm trying to, sir.
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Right.
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
No, sir.  I'm sure we wouldn't.
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
We don't operate like you KGB boys.
Yes?
Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
They must have been fired from Bromdingna - probably one of their new Vampire - 202's. They've got a range well over a hundred miles.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
Roger.
No, this looks like the real thing.
In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar.  Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run.  Any questions?
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Bomb doors circuit is green, bomb release circuit is green, bomb fusing circuit is green.
Primary circuit is live.
He's dead.
Where'd they get you?
How do you know he's dead?
I don't know what we got left besides Bim and Bam.
What do you mean?
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
But who would be chosen?
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
Um-hm.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Well, what it was... I, I don't want to admit it, but, you know, I was jealous of Pony.
Yeah, I guess.
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
No, no, no, no, I don't wanna be stuck with the guy. I want the tickets.
Yeah.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I wouldn't. If I were in his shoes, every morning I'd get up singing, man. Do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of Coors Lite. Then I'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather Victoria Secret custom-made bodysuit. So I'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. Except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. And then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching Gilligan.
That sounds so depressing.
Okay, okay.
You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
What, they're looking for her?
Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
Look.
Buff...
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
In what way?
Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
Hey, yes! Hey, Pony, man! Great concert tonight!
"Closed, closed, closed." But with your music.
I could.
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Come on. Inside.
No, not really. Middle-class.
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Hi.
Oh, uh, Erica? Erica is the publicist for the band.
Two-fifty? They go up?
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Because I was fucked up, man. I just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
Yeah, of course they let me out. Chickenshits. I gotta pay some class C misdemeanor ticket. So did I call it or did I call it? She spent the night, didn't she? Hm? Oh, that sucks for you, pal. Oh, shit.
You lied to me.
Oh, shit.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Jeff, stay there.
Tim, can we go? This is ridiculous.
You know, it's not you. You know? You seem like a smart guy.
Was that supposed to be me?
Like what?
Hey!
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
I don't know. I would've done something. This is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? This place is so stupid. I can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. With all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
What?
Us.
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
So, what, why can't you do that here? What's wrong with here? Why is somewhere else better?
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
No. No, no, no.
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
God, you smell like whiskey.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Well, what about us?
Good, man.
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah.
Yeah, they could be songs.
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Is that Jeff?
Yeah? Well, what'd she say?
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Could you give me a ride?
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
If you don't - can you still afford to go to Harvard?
If you reach for the stars, you're bound to get -- mm-Jack, pull over.
I'm sorry.
Madonna.
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Yeah, hold on.
Well, we'll each probably want one - so let's make it five.  Five should do it.
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Roll 'em.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
Good party.
Thank you.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character...
Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while.
How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Hello, Artie.  Good evening, Miss Schaefer.
I tell you this is half sold.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
What for?  I can say anything I want with my eyes.
What month?
The name is Gillis.  I'm single.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
What scene?
All padding.  Don't let it fool you.
Hold me tighter.
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
You're really going to send it to De Mille?
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
No, they don't.
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
De Mille didn't have the heart to tell you.  None of us has had the heart.
This room has not been used for a long time.
Along is no good.  I need it now.
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.
Did you hate him?  Had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
You can do it. You're the most powerful woman on Earth.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
I have to.
Who didn't?
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
We're from different worlds.
All this talk about love, it's silly.
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.
I'm not mad at you.
But what if---it wasn't real?
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
What?
How do I fight it?
She's right. They'll string her up.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
This is your problem, right here. This girl's driving you insane, Ethan. Let me help you.
Gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
Can I give you a lift?
How do you know?
You see, a tree is a living thing.
Linda babes! There's this all-night party at Eddie's... his folks are away...
Oh, I don't know. I'm not signed out for an overnight.
What can I do for you?
I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
Which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
That horrible woman!
There is a way.
Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Tuesday.
There's no vodka in it.
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
I didn't --
Who?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
But all he had was chocolate milk.
There's a lot of choices here.
No, I mean Ricky. He's not interested in any of this stuff.
Well, aren't you excited?
Kent!
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Sonofagun! Look at this here!
So where is all them half-centses?
How many sugars?
Please, Mr. Webster, you're a great humanitarian. Ain't you heard what it's like in them jails? You send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
Man, what is this?
Just the man I wanted to see!
Turn on the T.V.
Not like this one you ain't. Nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it don't exist yet. We got to build it.
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Yeah? How's it look?
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
You want to mess with Superman?
No, we're just going down.
We back in Metropolis?
I didn't have my camera with me.
What about me?
Why do I have to do this?
We've already met.
I thought you'd never get here.
I don't know you, lady.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
Small potatoes.
Don't you see? Okay, so you didn't kill him. Nobody's perfect. But that stuff we ran up in the lab wasn't a complete failure after all.  Right after Gus gave it to him, Superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
He's the only one who can operate this --
Anybody been hurt?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
I do?
Really?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Maybe you wanted to.
Sleep well?
You're not selfish at all.
. . . Superman?. . . . .
Everything on it?
Does Lois know about this yet?
What else is ballast for?
A bikini! I'll need to buy a new bikini, Lex.  C'mon. After being cooped up in that prison, haven't you thought about me in a bikini . . ...once maybe ?
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
Look at this! Snow. Ice.  Your idea of a good time.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
Game plan! It's fourth down and long yardage, the two-minute warning sounded and the ball's deep in our territory! How brilliant do you have to be?!
Wait, wait, wait just a moment. Wait till you've got to know better will you please.  Wait, -- look, I can give you anything you want. I can give you the brass ring, the - er -- unlimited freedom to maim, cure, destroy, chew - plus Lex Luthor's savvy. Lex Luthor's career guidance... Lex Luthor's School of...
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
Why do you say this to me when you know I will kill you for it?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
Yes. To all of us. The closer we come to an atmosphere with only one sun - a yellow sun - the more our molecular density gives us unlimited powers!
Look, they need a machine to fly.
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
It's brilliant. Daddy thinks so, too. You'll write a new series -- 'Metropolis After Hours.'
You're late. Very late.
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Gee, I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry to see you go.
Like me?
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Well, I don't understand.
Awesome!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
Well . . . I see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Who does Clark Kent think he is anyway! He never even said good night!
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Where's Clark?
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
Gee, Uncle Lex, I was just getting to the good part.
Destroy Superman!
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mom...
He may have a gun!
Know what?
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Is that what they're calling him?
Besides that.
Why does it all mean so much to you? All the time, 'land, land, land.'
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Some people can read 'War and Peace' and come away thinking it was a simple adventure story. Other people can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and come away with the secret of the universe.  Y'know.
See?
Meteorites!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Nothing, nothing. I just want to invite him to tea.
Miss Teschmacher, Superman is a fairly bright individual. My understanding of the way he works is that he won't be fooled by a simple trick.
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
What're you writing, Lois?
Need I ask who's favored to collect at the end of this week.
All these years, happy as we've been, how I prayed and prayed He'd see fit to give us a child. And just when I finally accepted my bitter lot...  No one must ever know.
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
Twenty-four.
Or twenty-four as it is in Earth time. Furthermore, if you will reveal yourself, your enemies will have a way of getting at you where you are vulnerable: by hurting the people you care for.  Ah, this Earth...this world you live in, Kal-El...  Resist its temptations, its rewards, especially its political system.
With my luck, now it'll rain.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
Can you really see through anything?
Very much.
I...uh...
I broke the man out of prison --
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
Is that real enough for you?
Not really.  The last time I saw her was at that clinic.  That was a long time ago.
She's in trouble?
Say hi to Zoe.
I hope she gets better.
My name is...
That's my daughter.  Or it may be the police to tell me that they've found her dead.  She's a drug addict.
Are you sure?
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
So what brings you out tonight?
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Well, maybe that's because they know I'm going to follow them.  Behind the bus.
Good night, Billy.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Because I have to.
Yes.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
You talked about it?
Berries.
And what's that?
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Nicole!
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
That you didn't die?  Like the other children?
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
Why?
I have no questions.
Tell me about the Ottos.
You always think you're prepared for these things.
Is this it?
Yes.  Give me your news, Zoe.
What do you want me to do, Zoe? I'll do whatever you want.
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Stephens. Would you like to try the fish?
Is there shrimp on it?
I'm not sure if that will leave much on the plate.
You think someone else caused the accident?
So you're just the thing we need.
Are you expensive?
Any criminal record?
Can't get off that shitty dump they live on.  What little money comes in goes to booze.
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
No.  Because the bus went off the road.  And crashed.
That was great.
You're going to blow everyone away.
You mean it?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
Partly.  But there's a lot the insurance doesn't cover.  That's one of the reasons we have a lawyer.  To make sure the insurance gets paid and to help us look after the rest.
What are you up to, Nicole?
No.
Yes.
I don't know.
Well, there's the Hamiltons.  Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Will you mind your own business!
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
Just hopping tonight.  Leo Bartha been in?
He's somewhere...
Did she accept?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
Thanks for the publicity spread you got the boys for the benefit tomorrow.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
...People catch on quick to such an item.  Van Cleve already called me - he's firing the quintet.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Susie likes to keep her girlish secrets.  But in her heart of hearts I imagine, Dallas, that she fancies you in an uncommon way. Now, what about YOU, son?  Not just tom-catting around...I hope?
I have to talk to you, alone, J.J., that's why.
You print them, don't you?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Are you finished?
Correct me if I'm wrong - WE! Because when I'm out on this very slippery limb for you, you have to know what's involved.
Uh huh.
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
With a pocket fulla firecrackers - good.
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
What sort of thing?
He wants me to break a leg?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Who else phoned?
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
Did you now?  On which bounce?
Yes, but why?
I didn't do anything!
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
This is big, you know.  Very big! Let's go out later, drink some firewater.  With the boys.  Fred can call Millie and -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.
What chip?
No good.
Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
Yes.  Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
I need a minute here, okay?  You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
Listen to me, very carefully, okay?  You're not a terminator any more.  Alright?  You got that? You can't just go around killing people!
Everything.
"Hasta la vista, baby"?
Yeah, or "later, dickwad."  Or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  Like that.  Or you can do combinations.
Chill out, dickwad.
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Torque wrench please.
I'm sorry, John.
It must end here... or I am the future.
Out of the way, John!
Yeah.  Right.  How were you supposed to know? Fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  Did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  Colt, Browning, Smith, Thompson, Kalashnikov... all men.  Men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  You're so creative.  You don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  To feel it growing inside you.  All you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
It's John who's the target now.  You have to protect him.  He's wide open.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
On August 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  Anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires.  Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler?
What's not right?
I made no deal!
May I ask a question?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
You sure knew a lot of people in high places.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
Yes, a despicable human being. He was in the Ministry of Culture. His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts.
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Think carefully, Wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
And what did he say?
I have no idea.
You've really no idea? I'll tell you what happened. He died in Stalingrad.
I'm sorry.
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
Major.
Helmuth.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Who's he?
The Miracle Kid.
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Right. Claims assessor.
I don't know.  I kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Alright!
Can you handle it?
I hate the beige one.
You must have a girlfriend.
That's none of your business.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
One possible future.  Four your point of view.  I don't know the tech stuff.
There's so much...
It's okay.  Forget it.
What?
Didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
Tactically dangerous.  We lay low.
That's not my mission.
Kyle?
And who was the enemy?
Why?
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
Give me the short version.
Here's her driver's license.
Send a unit.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Did you play recently?
You don't talk to me like that.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Excuse me, I need to explain...
I was trying to tell you... it's a game.
What are you talking about?
There's got to be a flashlight.
Home.
Long story.  I found this key in the mouth of a wooden Harlequin.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
That one did.
A fresh shirt...
What's wrong?
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
They won't...
Stop talking to them!
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Where are you going in such a hurry?
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
Boyfriend?
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
Elizabeth?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
You need anything?
Fun?
Tell me you'll call.
It doesn't matter...
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
Yeah, almost...
They fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  And then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
Slow down, take a breath...
What have they been doing to you?
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
It's them.  They did this.
The phone's dead.
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yeah.
Have you gone to the police?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
There's nothing to forgive.
You're going?  Well, thanks again.  Good to see you, Rachel...  Thanks for coming, Mel.  I'll get your car back.  Right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  Sorry.
I'll call.  I really will.
Tailored specifically to each participant.  Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
And if nothing's lacking?
Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
How long will these take?
An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
You don't need me...
I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
Isn't this what you like?  They told me you had a thing for boats.
Dinner's in the oven.
I've finished for the evening.  Will you be needing anything else?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Let me think...  Hordes of men in tuxedos.  Everyone's droning.  Ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
Pardon me?  I'm afraid I don't...
What the fuck... ?!
What's happened...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
Very well.  If you tell me not to worry, I shan't.
Luke, can I talk to you?
I gave my key to the gate to Todd, but the Dudleys'll be here in the morning.
The rest of you may hate your insomnia, but I find it the best time of the day for me.  I'm alone.  Nobody's talking to me but myself.  My mind is racing with ideas, and I can think.
All night?
Yeah.
Nell!
I, I just can't...
What did it smell like?
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
Why would we want to do that, Nell?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
She was unhappy.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
I love this house.  I really love this house.
Theo... Did you?
Well?
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Then what good is he?
Well, you're certainly not a person.
Italian.
We all did.
We think someone is here.
No.
Same as last time -- the rest after.
There's been some trouble downtown.
No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
You should have let me do the talking.
I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
We'll find him.
I wouldn't talk.
CQ what?
What more is there.
This ain't your lot?
Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service.
Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom.
It's only insurance.  Can't be too careful.  This Terry Valentine, he's probably a wonderful fella.  They were together how long?
Five years, I think.  Long time.
Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile.  You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a "private" service.  Private for who. Him?
Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny.
Valets.  What d'ya mean valets.  What is he, then, the Earl of fucking Doncaster?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
I've been wondering something.
Same.
Uh-huh.
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
That's not what I heard.
What was that, then?
How'd you manage that, then.
Modelling.
When did you get in?
Well, I reckoned, Saturday night, if you were goin' out, you'd probably have to come home first.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
My employer.
I bet.
Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Overnight.  What about just now?
I've 'ardly ever left it.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her.
Up the coast.
Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Hey.
Which kind?
I don't know.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky.
Exercising my visitation rights.
Is he here?
Who's looking for you?
I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were.
Thanks.  You, too.
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Geez, Mr Crane.
But more or less.
...I wanted to make you happy.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
Uh--
It's called dry cleaning. You heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. It's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. And here's the capper: no shrinkage.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
...I didn't recognize you without the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave something at the shop?
No. I--tell me--
No problem!
...That's quite a wife you got there.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
That's my capitalization on the Annex! *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. That's what I was just talking to Doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann.
...What kind of man *are* you?
What kind of man *are* you?
Big Dave--
I'd understand if you'd walked in here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. I deserved it.
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
Look, chum, this is a guy, from what I understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? Island hopping, practically liberated the Pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of Jap guts between his teeth.
Sure you don't need one?
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long distance here.
Uh-huh.
OK.
Just people. They gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. This is why the big lobby, Ed. But they put their pants on one leg at a time. Just like you and me.
...We goin'?
Crane. Ed Crane.
His eyes are open.
Uh... you're under arrest.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Hurry up!
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
I believe in you a hundred percent, Vince, but that's the second time we've been at that intersection.
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  John used it as packing material.
What's going on?
What's that?
This means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
Read it out loud.
Margo, this is too dangerous.  You always think you can solve everything.  This time you don't have enough information.  The animal might behave in unexpected ways.  Leave her here with me.  Don't put her in danger.
Evolutionary Biologist.  I study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
Jesus, what is this?
What do you make of it, Margo?
This is it.  This is what he, or it... is after!  The plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
How about lunch?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
John couldn't have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  He was a fine man despite his problems --
How did you know that?
A monster?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Where would we find it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
How?
We're not going to make the storage room!
I don't believe it.
He has to look here or I won't get a clear shot.  Call him, Margo.
<i>Where</i> in Fiji?  What island?
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
I understand he's hardly had a life of his own since he left the show.  How did you convince him--was it the opportunity to be close to Truman again?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
Certainly a nomination.
As with our own lives, the only people he can't cast are his family.  Otherwise he has final approval, able to elevate an extra into a lead role as was the case with his only real friend, Marlon, or alternatively relegate a star to a bit player.
We should remind viewers that Truman, especially as a child, presented a challenge for the production.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
You think she'd go through with it?
You take Japanese.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Nursery?
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
Every time you and Marlon--
It'd be an adventure.
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
I know.
How do you know?
What did you want?
Oh, my God!
I don't know--
Who were you talking to?!
--Darling--
I'm afraid that's impossible--she's in pre-op.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
Do you live around here?
Special Agent Scully --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Working with?
This man's still alive.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Feds are looking for him, too.  Real nice business he's got, huh?
You looking for him for some other reason?
Some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. We thought there'd been another fatality, but we found out FEMA had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
And what's that?
He just let it explode.
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
What killed those men?
What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
No. I haven't.
Jesus, Mulder...
Why?
I think you must have an idea. They cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
I don't know. But I have a hunch what you're going to find here isn't anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
What did you find?
You said you weren't coming?
Where would they be going?
I've got to be in Washington D.C. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. And here I am standing out in the middle of nowhere Texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
What do you think it is?
We've got to keep moving.
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
I don't have his number.
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
Where's Scully?
About the conspiracy?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Let me out. Stop the car.
You have precious little time. What I've given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. You hold in your hand the power to end the project.
My god...
And if it doesn't? By cooperating now we're but beggars to our demise! Our ignorance was in cooperating with the Colonists at all.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before.  It's not happening.
You're sure?  Any more nightmares?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
Remember, Julia Hickson is priority number one.  Nothing else matters.  Find out where she is.
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
You sure about this?
Into Stargher.  Inside...
What about narcotics?
No.
Is she alright?
How is she?
I don't know, Pete, but for god's sake... This is nuts.  Do you really understand what they're going to do?
Thank you.
Sit down.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
What's she talking about?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Harry?
Tell me more.
I'm so sorry.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
...is there?
I shall be all right.
...quarrel?
Of course.
They're Harry's.
No.
I don't know.
I would very much like to meet you, Baron. Come around.
Where?
You a friend of Lime's?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
Listen, Callaghan.
Bring him in.
I followed his shadow until suddenly...
Well?...
This is where he vanished.
It wouldn't work.
Calloway!
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
You do!
How long can one stay here on this stage money?
Seems exciting.
Hello - Mr. Martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. We have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
Hmm.
What do you want me to do?
...were of you.
...you.
...the best way one can, you know.
Not saw, heard...heard. I heard the brakes. Wham! And I got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er Joseph...that's Joseph Emperor Joseph Statue.
Could he have been conscious?
Der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. I should have listened to my wife. She said you were up to no good. Gossip.
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.
Harry...
He probably knows a lot more than that. Somebody's lying.
Mr. Martins...
Okay.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Traveler.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
One or two kilometers.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
She is gone!
What idiot would lend him money? It would disappear.
But he has been there, off course.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Not too bad.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
They sound like you.
Fucking Danny, man...
That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces.
What do you care?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Yeah, but not on the letters.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
What's he care about?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Oh, really?
Va-yomer... And he said.  It goes the other way.
What assholes.
Where are they?
And belief follows?
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Did you know that there was a <i>New York Times</i> reporter there that night?
...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point?
They're liars and cowards.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
Did you ever fuck one, Guy?
Female...
He has Israel.
Of course they're Jews.
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group.
If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Think about your father. Your sister.
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
What are you doing here?
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
This will be a different kind of device.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
Where?
When do you want it to go off?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Danny, listen, people expect me to daven; they don't want someone they don't know -- leading their prayers.
How?
What are you trying to say?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?
Who's this?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Fund-raising??
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
No.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
No!
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
You know each other?
Yes.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
The Mamma's there too.
... Not yet.
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  And he's only waiting for one thing:  that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
Is he here?
The rules are the rules.
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  And you're throwing him out!  Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
How do you make a living?  Your experiments, does it pay well?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
What?
You don't have that one, do you?
He doesn't like us.
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name!  Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
In the lake?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
How can you tell it's a female?
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
Hello?
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Why?
What?
Where are you from, Henrietta?
Uncle Louis!
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
Well... here.
It's my apartment.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
Will he understand Spanish?
Okay, okay.  You'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
I got the job done didn't I? I did what I had to do.
Mordechai. Thank god you're here.
Looks like I got a plane to catch.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther. Santa's got her.
You like my Mordechai, yes?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
Want to get a drink?
Shabat Shalom mama. I brought some Manischewitz. The black label.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
So, what's our first plan of attack Santa?
What should I charge?
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
That cat ain't mean. I feed him out of my own hand for six years. Why don't he kill me? At night in the truck, I let him out of the cage. When I am falling asleep I hear him walking back and forth. I go to sleep. He don't hurt me.
Sure, I like my leopards
Two hundred and fifty dollars you owe met
He will be waiting...
Well, I'd best be off.
Just a minute, Robles.  Let him go on.
I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
That's a fact, isn't it?
Yeah.
The whole town's in a state, Kiki ——doors locked, people huddling together like scared sheep ——nobody on the streets at night ——
——	As long as my feet held out.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Good afternoon. De Moraes’s residence.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress’s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers  and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise.  You don’t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he’s either on the run, held captive, or dead.  I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I’ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I’m here at such a late hour. I need £20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
When did you get back?
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
Leon could still have hung himself.
You don’t say.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
...We’re turning in circles.
Simplify and damn.
Don’t you believe in simplicity?
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
To get me killed...?
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
Get to the point, will you...
Directory enquiries. Can I help you?
Croissants.
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
I saw the ad at George’s.  I’m passing through town and I’m in a hurry.
...On holiday?
I don’t know...  This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don’t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that’s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I’d given you and then got back, remember? I can’t find it. Do you know where it is?
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
Look Mrs Spitz... I don’t know to whom I’m indebted for the recommendation but... I’m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
I presume you checked your son’s apartment...
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
What happens now?
Vous êtes Français?
Clients come and go.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Five to three. You’re early.
I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
Er... Yes...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
Huh... I guess you ain’t quite ready for civilisation yet... I’ll give you one more day, a meal, and then you’re on your way.
Welcome to the club.
Excuse me?
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You don’t know Leon, do you?
What about which girlfriend?
You’re the lantern man, huh?  If you wanna see what’s left of him...
The acid bath?
Some guy called to let him know the Frenchman who’d called the night before he left London was in L.A. looking to kill him. He did his sums and decided to take the call seriously.
You’re sure he said his caller was a man?
What you gonna do? Kill me?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I also need someone who can read and write.
Who do they think I am?!
Tell me...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
What did the king say?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
But it is what I want.
I want to stay with you...
Sound the retreat...
No...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
Do you have a sword?
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
It is the sacred place that matters, Charles -- not the size.  Am I correct, Bishop?
Thirty years ago?  I'm not surprised it's gone...
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Whose side are you on, Cauchon?
Quick -- hide in here...
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
The voice was in your cell?
Many things...
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Please... may I have it back...
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... and what... what did he say?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising.  Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Everywhere.  Where is the food?
Jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  The Tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we're on the other side of the river attacking the Tourelles, what's to stop Talbot attacking the city from the north?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
But the bridge has been pulled down!
Do you know how to count?
But my voices... they promised me...
Tell us, Jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at Beaurevoir?
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
What's the use?  The drawbridge is up!
Jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
What about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses weren't they?
What are you doing out here?
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  Why not face up to your lies?  It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
I... I never lied!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
My... visions...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
They won't come anyway.
What signs?
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Are you going to leave me too?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
Dorota, don't be ridiculous, he's a pediatrician.
He'll be back before curfew.
How long have you been married?
When's your baby due?
Have you seen this?
Calm down, what, what is it?
Henryk's in there.
Can you help?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Oh? More Jewish police? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see!
Boys, boys...
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
Five hundred. You know how many people on average read one copy? Twenty.  That makes ten thousand readers. These will start the uprising. Majorek hides them in his underpants. And leaves them in toilets.
You've heard the rumours they're going to resettle us in the East?
I've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father. I've been trying all the firms, the shops...
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Jurek? Wladek Szpilman.
Wladek! How are you?
Pig!
Dirty pig!
You made contact?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
I've got another one.  Warmer.  What will you do when it's all over?
Yes, like a cave.
What's he say?
What for?
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
You have to wash them.
He chopped it off
What's in here then, lead?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
That's right.
Naw, it's okay.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
If that punk and his pals decide to search ya, you'll never fool 'em carryin' it there.
Listen Duke, we're setting up a wire store.  I need a twenty man boost right away.
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Aw hell, you sound like some goddamn sucker.  You know everything I know.  You got nothin' more to learn from me.
We'll put Salino on it.  I need somebody careful.
He's not comin' in.  Not to get bounced off a job anyway.
We had a few problems with the Law this morning.  The Mayor promised the Jaycees to get tough on the rackets again, so he shut everybody down for a couple hours to make it look good.  Nothing serious, it just put us a little behind for the day.
Which way did he do, Eirie?
They workin' for anybody?
I don't know.  Could be.  We're runnin' that down now.
Combs gave it to Reilly and Cole.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I'm sorry about Luther.  He was the best street worker I ever saw.
Lonnegan after you, too?
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
Then you'll do it?
And?
He threatened to kill me.
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Yeh.
You beat him, kid.
Never get enough, huh pal?  I'd think you'd get tired of losin', Honnigan.
The name is Lonnegan.
Not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to Lonnegan. He'll swat you like any fly.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
You done?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
Hooker!
Then why the rat?
And you were gonna pay me back?
I think we oughta place another bet tomorrow.
What happened?
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
I don't know.  He took it hard.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
What the hell good is Hooker to ya?
Yes.  He admitted it.
Any luck?
I only know I want to marry you... right now, and --
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Give it to me.
No.
Then what are you hiding?
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
He's waiting for you.
Yes.
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Why... in the heart.
I don't know.
Don't lie to me.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
A new invention?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
Did you kill her?
What'd he think it was to you?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Oh, he's all right.  We know all about him.  He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
Trail him!  Trail who?
Get anything?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
Shut up.
Well, what?
I see.
That's ridiculous.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I thought you said you weren't going there.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
Go ahead!
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I can't! I haven't got it!
Oh, he's sitting up.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Where's Gilbert?
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
What am I?  The fall guy?
I had him out this morning.
How many drinks have you had?
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
You mean, he might be hiding there?
You wouldn't be a widow long.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
He was down in the shop.
Yes!
Got a nice evening dress?
You're going to drive me crazy!
It's the only way it makes sense.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
I'm sorry.  Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Bonds, sir?
Where are you going?
Baghdad.
What's in the other direction?
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
They shouldn't have been here.
Maybe we are crazy for doing this.  But if we do it, we do it right.  I just needed to explain that in a way I wouldn't have to do it again.
What do you figure it to be?
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
Epps!
Get off him.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
You don't know that.
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Suppose I don't go for that?
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't worry about Jaeger.  He uses his personality as a form of birth control.
You think?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
I think you've got some issues to deal with.  Really, when we get out of here I'm pretty sure it's shrink time for you.
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
They'll shoot us!
Figure they don't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them.
Just relax.
Why you got to move away to talk!?
You're going to be fine.
When we start running suck up your breath.  You're going to get the wind knocked out of you.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
I didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing.  We're in this together, understand?
It's a fire fight.
I'm not.  And I'm not doing anything, because there's nothing down here.
Get up and dig.
It's just a mongoose.
It should, or it will?  Least going back the way we came we know what we're up against.
And you; you've got it all together.
Sorry.
Wonder how the war's going?
Don't you touch it.
They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them.  They couldn't tell in the dark.
And then what?
What do we do?
Why haven't they killed us!?
I don't know!
With what?  Against how many?
We can't just sit here waiting to die.
...Wes...?
The...the gold...
But...
We had a deal.  No one touches the gold until we're out of here.  No one breaks the deal, no one had anything to worry about.
Yeah, you're funny.
It's a puzzle box.  If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
What?
What!?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
We have to go back.
We're not going anywhere.  Not 'til we get what we came for.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Hurry up.
What did you get?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
Don't take anything.
I'll try.
They don't know.
It's the end.
What?
What?
Where is LUH?
What's going on?
You know I have a way with the computers.  I can clear myself for any area.....almost.
...and you're not lost now?
We've lost SEN!
What?
Maternity ward, huhh!
She's not there
Yes.
Yes.
...rooms with her.  Our relationship is normal, conforming.  We share nothing but space.  What is she doing to...
Coffee, Mike?
Go ahead.
Aren't you on suspension?
Just do it.
Where did you get this?
Hey, look--
So what were they doing here?
Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
Except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
Why do you do it?
Should we head for the Interstate?
Nothing.
More metal... sharp edge...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
Alright!
Alex Swan. My brother. The other two are called Taylor and Leveau.
Thank you.
Then why tell me?
What is that?
Alex, please.
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
You were lucky today, vice boy. Captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, I'm watching you.
He is!
Unsolved bombings in the last year... Boston, New York, Philadelphia... but no real match
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Nice to be here.
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
And diamonds in the front.
The representative of the police wants to know if there is anything wrong with your tonsils.
But before I say goodbye I want to ask you one question: Have you ever been in Venice?
And harems ... ?
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Just dull.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
Just as you say, Doctor.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Why should you?
Thank you.
Last year? It can't be that long.
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Right.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Certainly!
They're all right, aren't they?
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Yes.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Oh! You didn't read it!
But one suggestion, madame.  Not the major.  I don't  mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ...  And one lipstick ...  Scarlet number four.
Too much blue in crimson.
That's too dark.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at <u>home</u>?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
The same thing.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Um-hum ...
Hair?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Any minute I want!
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I'm crazy about you!
<u>I</u> <u>love</u> <u>you</u>.
Then why do you want to go?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Goodbye...
Yes, Madame Colet?
What is it, madame?
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
Right!
Ever had a romance with a crook?
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
Your bag?
Yes, my bag!
Five compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it.
How much time?
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
The partners want to know how it's going?
None of the stewards have seen her.
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
I know.  Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
No thanks. I'm heading back.
You know somebody?
Keep pulling... away from the ship. Pull.
You're welcome. Rose.
So don't marry him.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Jack, I --
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Could it have damaged the ship?
It's so cold.
April 14, 1912.
Do you want the truth, Anya?
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Will you pardon me?
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Tell me.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
How well do you know her?
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship. 
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
You don't think--?
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Thank you.  I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
What is it?
You keep it-- 
Say--wait a minute!
It's your deal.
Oh, yes. On the pier.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Why?
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
Where do you live?
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Hello, Denby!
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
Very serious?
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
What for?
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Not because of Ned.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
He'll be back.  What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Thank you.
Nothin'.
Then why did you run away?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Wyatt Earp...Dodge City, right?
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
Easy.  I just wanted to tell you Things're about to start changing Around here.  Lots of so-called Hard cases and tough-nuts swagger Around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  None of 'em.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
I see, off to strike it rich, Huh.  All right, fine, wish you Luck.  Tell you this though, never Was a rich man yet didn't wind up With a guilty conscience.
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
My fight's not with you, Holliday.
All right, lunger.  Let's do it.
Since when is faro a business?
So tell me, Wyatt.  I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man?  Forsaking all Others?
Satisfied?
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Doc...
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
How you feelin', Doc?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
All right, Doc...
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Then why in hell're you doin' This?  You ought to be in bed.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Praise Jesus!
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
That was lovely!
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
You'd die for fun?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Just doesn't, that's all.
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Wyatt!  My God...
Come up to the fire, honey.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
Florentino!  He's getting away!
Maybe, yeah.  Hell, I don't know.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Morgan, are you crazy?  They're Out gunning for us!  What the Hell're you doin'?
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virgil?
Why don't you just leave it alone?
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
It's too late -
Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour.  For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago -
At least we know where the gold is. When are the recovery ships due?
How did you get this number?
Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond.  Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions:  News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers:  2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Four o'clock. Don't be late.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Retired. I'm not getting paid to help you save the world anymore.
Is this another one of your games?
Shhhhh...
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
More scurrilous, unsubstantiated gossip.
Moving along -  A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here -  And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
Hey - the world is my office.
Yo! Jimbo! I won five hundred -  What happened?
Happily.
Thanks.  Take care -
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
Do I have to do everything around here?
That's funny: you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection.
Are you listening to me?
Sleep well?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Forget it. No way. I got here first.
My name is Sidney Winch, and -
The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
Yes -
What's wrong?
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
You have to leave -
- Built to withstand a nuclear blast.  Are they alive?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Will you still get the money from your father?
Why does he always pick on me?
Like muddy waters?
Who is it?
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation. I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end. Now I'm going to ask him how come he couldn't be at your birthday.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
I hope that it's nothing serious.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Let me get you a cup?
Now who are we talking about?
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Last Saturday we handed out over two hundred meals.
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Rush your mouth, girl. No, he didn't. He cannot be that big of a damn fool.
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
But when your sunflowers come up, I'll pay you for them.
Can we leave this up 'til we move?
Oh, I'm sure he's there.  You're just not looking hard enough.
But what if we leave them behind?
Aach! -- Oh, hi, Bo.
What are you doing over there?
Whoooooah!  Oh!  Bo!  There's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
He's not a Space Ranger!  He doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
No, you can't.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
You mean it has hyperdrive?
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Don't tell me what to do!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Shhhhhhh!
Great!
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
I dunno.
No!  No, no, no, no!
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Reach for the sky!!
You'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. Me name is Finn, me brother is called Francie -
There's no mirror.
Who's there?
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
So did I.
I appreciate you coming in so early.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
I tried, Arnie.  And, I will continue to try.
It's Saturday, Arnie.  You work too hard.
What?
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Carl, that's insane.
So my wife is lying?
Stop.  You experimented in college. I don't want to hear about that.
I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day.  That's different.
God, I don't get it.  Are we supposed to say to ourselves, be prepared to lose her, be prepared to lose our child?  Why does this happen to someone? How does it happen?
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Are you going to?
Live with your parents?
Yes.
Yeah.
What is this, like freebase?
You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day?  He and my mom have cocktail hour every night, from six to seven, set your clock, two bourbons --
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
Did Courtney Love play Nancy in Syd and Nancy?
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.
When will you do it?
You planning on going somewhere, Eduardo?  You don't like it here? This is the best situation you're going to have for a long, long time.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son.  I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.  Your route is compromised.  Perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in California.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
It's important that we work together. Mexico.  America.  One hand washing the other.
Does this offer include my partner?
She hasn't called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between our countries will help with this problem.
Did you tell him?
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Jesus.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Where are you going, Diane?
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Can I see you again?
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Morning, Spud. Sit down and have some breakfast.
I'll put the sheets in the washing machine just now.
Are you getting out much?
No.
Now remember --
Right.
I chose not to choose life: I chose something else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who need reasons when you've got heroin?
You Only Live Twice?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
And I wondered if you'd care to go to the park tomorrow.
Who wrote it?
Roald Dahl.
It's certainly a phenomenon in all walks of life.
No, it's not bad, but it's not great either, is it? And in your heart you kind of know that although it sounds all right, it's actually just shite.
I think Allison had been screaming all day, but it hadn't really registered before. She might have been screaming for a week for all I knew. It's been days since I've heard anyone speak, though surely someone must have said something in all that time, surely to fuck someone must have.
Oh no, don't even mention it.
Are you serious?
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sure.
It's a nightmare. She told me she didn't want our relationship to start on a physical basis as that is how it would be principally defined from then on in.
Well, what are you waiting for?
What do you see as your main strengths?
A Federation starship.
This is Captain Pavel Chekov speaking. You are in violation of Neutral Zone Treaty. I advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
I instruct you to surrender. You are under attack by Federation forces.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
I apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on Nimbus III.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Your pain runs deep.
Where did you get this power?
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
Captain, we can't trust anyone now.
She's got partial power, sir. I might be able to take two of you.
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
And that is?
"Row, row, row your boat..." I love "Row..."  Do - do you know "Row, Row, Row, Row, Row Your Boat?"
Yes, Captain.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Is it possible?
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
Spock... don't.
What is this?
James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
What makes you think I won't turn us around?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...




Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
Sybok, you must surrender.
I cannot go with you.
Hi, Alan.
This honey doesn't handle so good in town...
It's our friend the boy detective. He's nosing around again.
Ed, I am so very disappointed in you.
What do you want with the Pentagon?
The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do. I can't sit and worry about every little user request that --
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
Where did you hear that name?
Well, isn't it -- ?
Greetings, program...
Yori, steer us over the beam, right next to it.
It's all circuits...  Must be an input/output component...
Well...my home "sector" was called Paramus ...
PARAMUS... wonder what those initials stand for ...  ...probably Program Assist Routine -- well, it sounds like a lovely place.
Feel what? You okay?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Hey... !
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
Wait...I need that...
You think we can make it there?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
You seem fine now.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Yes.
Why?
Thanks dear.
Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just a river in Egypt.  She's probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
I thought you moved out.
Look at the way the little punk is driving.  He's all over the place.  Look-- he hasn't signalled once.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Put a tap on her phone.
She could be telling the truth.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
No!  Never!
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
And you still reach for your piece every time.
Well, what's the point of waiting?
Hello, Harry.
Uh huh.  Okay.
Why did you continue to see him?
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
Let me handle this part.  Do you mind?  Why did you go to Carlos' hideout?
He wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something...
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
Yes.
Ask me a question I would normally lie to.
17 years.
I don't take those assignments.
She's really a fox, isn't she?
Did you pork her Harry?
Oh shit.
Okay, just ask yourself.  What do women really want?  You take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  Stuck in a rut.  They need some release.  The promise of adventure.  A hint of danger.  I create that for them.
Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath. I'm a legal secretary.
What?
What's going on, Harry?
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
Like one?
Hello?
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?
You'll call me then?
I'm married!
Thank you.  You saved my life. What's your name?
Helen.
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Is that your real name? Really?
'Bout twelve.
How 'bout me what?
Ask me them again. One by one.
Turn-offs?
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
Uh-huh.
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
I do.
No no no no no no no no no...
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
What?
With a vengeance, I hated them.
What?
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Naw naw!
He don't got no right to live.
You got it.
What?
You goin' out?
I know.
Tell me.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What's this acting class guy's name?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
How 'bout me what?
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
He trusts you?
Yeah?
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
Where'd you go?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.  Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.  He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Wanna count your money?
She seems very nice.
What?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Do tell. Why drug related?
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
I got some money I can give you -
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood.  And what you're trying to do is get him off.  Whenever you're ready.
Sure was.
Do you believe him?
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I didn't mean -
Him?  You saw that man?
You said we weren't "real," Cole...
But just until you recover your, uh,... equilibrium.
Meaning...???
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
No, not possible.  Listen, I have to get out of here.  I'm supposed to be getting information.
Underground.
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
Give me the gun.
The gun! ... I lost it
James, you said he was hiding in the barn...
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
What's that mean?
What are you talking about???
What're you writing?  You a reporter?
What...???
Excuse me -- what did you say?
Listen to me -- I can't do anything about what you're going to do. I can't change anything.  I can't stop you.  I just want some information...
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
But you know what's real now?
Your psychiatrist?  Did you just say, "your psychiatrist"?
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
No, thank you.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
Ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Nothing.
One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. Now there ain't no way it's gonna be hotter than that.
Will be.
It's nonsense.
It is not.
Hey!
What time is it now?
Truck stop up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
To replace a God damn radiator hose!?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back.  You don't look so good.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
No charge.
What?
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
What would a truck stop be without beer?
Kirin?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
I got it.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
Least you can leave.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
Nice place you got here.
Where'd you learn to do that?
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Beautiful?
Like they're made of polyester.
You never did answer my question.
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
You know what I want.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
You could just leave him.
You just walk away.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Yeah.
Is it pretty?
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
Grace, I can't.  I can't even get out of here myself.  I need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
Where?
John?  John where are you going?
Kill someone.  I can't do it.
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
I could if I had Jake's money.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
I came back for you; this morning I came back.  Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want.
I don't know.
Never needed one.  I've never been anywhere.  I've got a backpack.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Not me.  Us.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
Are you all right?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
I have half a mind to--
Accident.
I guess we've never been introduced proper.  Jake McKenna.
Wait a second--
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.
No.
I had a problem getting my car back.
About things.  About your wife.
You meant it.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
You love her, but you hate her?
I hate loving her.  I hate the kind of her person she is.  I hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  I hate letting her use me. But I love her too much to do otherwise.  And I certainly love her too much to kill her.  I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  But you?  You got the killing in you, boy.
Maybe you heard old Jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you'd help yourself to a little.
Jake--
I came to kill her.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
I want to stay.
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that one movie.
How old are you?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
You expect me to believe that?
You're fucked.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
What the hell are you doing?  Are you crazy?
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Sheriff, he didn't give me any choice.  If I hadn't defended myself- -
Just cool down, son.  I ain't accusing you of anything.  Serves Toby right to get his ass whooped. If you hadn't done it, somebody else would've.
I don't understand what the--
I think you might just want to do as I say.
I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see?
Hell no!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. This town's all inbreeding.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Mister!
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
A lot that means.
I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna.
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
Would I what?
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I do.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride.
No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
You know what kind of woman Grace is, Jake. You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior.  What's she to you, Jake; a woman who wants you dead?  Let me kill her.  All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
What happened to your hand?
What the hell are you talking about?
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Look, Harlin.
What you want?
What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want?
Got any cold soda?
My name is Bobby.  Now I'm not a stranger anymore.  See how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
What happened to your hand?
You're welcome, Grace.
I just drove in this morning.
Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
Where'd you learn to do that?
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life.
No more drapes to hang.  Now what should we do?
Still playing?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
No.
Yeah.
Where?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
You know I thought you'd left me back there.
And I love you too.
That's a nasty cut you got there.
Right, Mr. Arkady. And that's not the half of it. I got your money, and I go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...And let me guess.  This robber -- he gets your money.
No. Two of them. Two robbers. And they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
The old lady?
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
One way.
Morning Grace.
Proceed.
How old is Jeb?
I'm listening.
What about Jeb?
I don't think I got the job in New York.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
...I think rust.
My turn. What's your favorite song?
I'm not sure.
You've never been sick?
Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
You've misunderstood.
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
I thought he was carrying something.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
You think you could beat up Mike Tyson? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people's ears?
No.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I mean if you knew karate?
You like sports?
Now you're going to have to tell me more.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore.  If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
How so?
You and my mother would have a special connection.
I fined 'em instead.
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
He give 'em names?
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
Oh. How long I been here?
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Shit and fried eggs.
Books. He's my biographer.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Those cowboys messin' him up?
Uh... a little, maybe.
No?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Yup.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
That much, huh?
Ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the County office day or night. I guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
What?
Ned's share?
He's... he's dead.
He said that, huh?
Well, how about it?
Jesus!
Three ways, I figured.
What the hell are you pissin' about, I'd like to know?
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Well... I don't recollect.
Get some sleep, Kid.
What happened? He ain't dead? What's goin' on?
Is it him?
Lemmee see it.
I guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
You ain't shot.
B-b-books.  You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
Say, Bill... You ever... ever go into town... an' all?
HEY, KID.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Jesus, Bill, you got fever. Take a drink, will you?
Worms was comin' out.
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
Nothin's bent.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
&lt;&lt;Are you sure?&gt;&gt;
&lt;&lt;Don't be stupid.&gt;&gt;
Edie, please. I don't want to hear this right now. What did Renault and Fortier say?
You are a criminal.
It's a logistical nightmare. Close quarters, no advance layout, ten men, maybe twenty.
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
What is it Keaton?
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
The answer is no.
Ahh, Mr. Hockney. Do join us.
Who is he?
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Someplace else, then.
Keyser Sate or not, if Keaton's alive he'll never come up again.
Waste of time.
A rumor is not a rumor that doesn't die.
No, no, no, no, no.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
I know you liked Keaton I know you think he was a good man.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
You know Ruby is in Attica?
He didn't have my lawyer.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
Do you believe in him, Verbal?
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
Can we just get back to Kobayashi?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
But Keaton...
But Keaton had. Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor. She knew who he was and what he knew.
No...
You think he's..?
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Abrams...
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
I want to settle this thing and be done with it.  I don't want the Archdiocese exposed.
So what I want to do is stop it here.  I'm going to make him an offer.  I want to do it myself.  I want it to come from me.
We thought it was just.
This is going to drive the ante up.
No, actually, she was referred to me.  She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Yes.
Anything special about the case?
Yes.
Yes!
No, I am not.  It's quite common in New York State...
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
How old are you?
I'm on the staff of...
Huh!
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
Is that what a good doctor would do?  How old are you, please?
Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
... Deborah Ann Kaye ...
Right.  Who called?
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
From the magazine?
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
They, uh, they got to my witness.
Isn't there something you...
Well, then what are you doing here?
He's not in, Sir.
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...?  He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness...he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis...don't fuck with this case.
Admittance form is wrong.
Jimmy?  Bushmills.   Lookit, do me a favor.  I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
So what?
D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?
`You guys are a bunch of whores...uh...loyalty...you don't care who gets hurt...you don't have any loyalty...'
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
The 'History'...?
...four years ago...
What are you doing in New York...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.
I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said...
Yes.
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
What happened in those three minutes...?
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Huh.  And why is that?
Should I?
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.   Jimmy, gimme another drink.    How are you?
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
Ah? That complicates the problem.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Ernie's.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
I didn't know where she was going to lead you.
Nothing.
And when she goes to those places...
I -- I --
Do you live here in the hotel?
Why?
They're none of them right.
You don't even want to touch me.
Where are you going?
No!
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
We're going up the tower.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
I loved you, Madeleine.
Love me... keep me safe...
Do you remember where you were?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Please drink your coffee.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
Wander about.
One shouldn't live alone.
Some people prefer it.
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
How can you be sure?
Where?
Where were you born?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
No, I can't tell you!
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
No, don't go away!
Yes?! But --
Please answer my question.
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
How do you know? Personal experience?
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Easy, now.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
Jesus.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
Can't do what?
What?
First of all...
Multiple reasons.
And you're a little fucking reject.
Wait!
We have to call the ambulance.
Stop it!
Just stop.
Just giving the facts.
What about the blood?
So that's what we're doing.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Adam! Calm down.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
That's one idea.
Don't ever stare him down.
I know and I'm honored...
I want you to hear me out.
What.
I got you.
Well, oh...
I don't understand where this personal attack is coming from...
She's in there!
No I don't.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
Micheal, now is probably not the best time for this.
OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely inappropriate behavior here.
He's cracked up.
Boyd...What have we done?
Say it again.
This is a situation that defies judgement. We have acted and showed courage that is not of a kind known by most.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Fine? Fine what?
The hell you didn't!
True.
You have a King fantasy.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
Florist?
I think I forgot the tent.
Why what?
Why did you forget the tent check?
They organized this, not me. I have nothing to do with it.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
Who else?
Charles Moore for instants.
It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
I've known him since Cub Scouts.
Do you love me?
Seating problems.
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
Do you love me?
Will you please call the chair people?
Yeah. Nesting.
The chairs.
"Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, mend me.
Can we just talk this out?
We're not canceling.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
You killed a prostitute.
It's too late.
But...
He kept saying he was protected.
No...
Everything okay?
I just want her to be happy.
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I think so.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
I guess.
...We will compare these before photos with whatever form of degeneration presented to us in 24 hours, no matter how low, how vile...
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
When I wasn't so miserable I used to sell pigs. Begging your pardon, I was more honest than my holy Mother.
Don Amalio!
Take me there.
My maid Ramona's daughter. She's a little animal.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Evil.
You must think I am a monster.
You must think I'm mad.
Sit down, woman, sit down.  You like me, don't you?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
But what can I say to her, sir?
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
What's the matter with you?
Nothing.
Why the bad temper?
I don't know, sir.
What do you know about me?
Do they worry you that much, then?
Where?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
Ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. Why didn't you write? I would have come immediately.
I've had a gutful of this.
She has the face of an angel. What a pity you can't see her.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar —— you making it okay in there?
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
When this is over, will you get this goddam thing out of my head?
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
That's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes' booby— trap. What's your point, Dr. Carter?
Not if you're with him every step of the way.
I watched your simulation, Mr. Barnes. Very impressive. You know, you're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive.
What happens if I can't catch him?
If Sid 6.7 hasn't killed you, we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of your sentence.
Sid is smart enough to know you'd check everywhere in the immediate area. Whatever the device is, he's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates.  Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel, water pipe, gas pipe, and sewer pipe that goes under, over, or into the arena.
Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system. If the simulator isn't calibrated properly, experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream. The experience becomes real.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country.  Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
I haven't been working on anything.
It feels so.. .real.
... and you get nano—death.  Don't worry, I've got a bunch of other ones.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
You amped the neural connectors back up, didn't you?  You're the reason the convict died. You're the reason I got fired!
I am beautiful, aren't I?
John died.
That's not true, Parker.
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
Go to hell.
You all right?
Manson didn't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene.
Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards. He suggested I kill you rather than him.
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
I couldn't tell you.
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
<u>Lure</u> him. 
What are you saying...
It's the White House.
The <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>Terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of... 
...mmm?
Three minutes.  It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
We're going to have to explain away the...
What crisis?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
We can't <u>afford</u> a war.
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...the... 
Why?
...<u>nothing</u>...
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
In the yellow ribbon.
No rain.
...this's <u>good</u>...
That's not bad at all.
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
All Combat takes place at night, in the Rain, and at the Junction of four Map Segments...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
But, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, Ron?  You think about it.  <u>This</u> is the meeting.  This, here.  Schumann and us.  King Kong and the Trainers...this's it... What are you working on?
Well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
I'll play your silly game.
Dartmouth
Trade Re1ations.
And you're here <u>why</u>...?
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
Well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
What is it?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
In the Folk Music Section.
...we get our hands on him?
Mmm.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Hell of a Ride, Stanley...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
We have no home.  We're vagrants.  N'each man's hand's against us.  We killed Old Shoe...  We killed the Schuster...spend our life in a packingcrate...Where are you <u>going</u>...?
Some'b'y'll have you killed.
No, I'm On Top of it...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
Show Must Go On.
Watch me.
But you always knew you couldn't <u>take</u> the credit....
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
Public Domain.
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
I need a ruling on the Hats.  I say a Leopard-skin, and...
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Mr. Lynch, I swear to you, he's lying!
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
Nice piece of work, Fox. Why don't you join me and the partners for lunch tomorrow in the dining room?
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
Wanna play some tennis Saturday?
D.K. -- didn't know -- who I was when the options he bought took a bath. He reneged on me.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Dividend. I figure I owe you about five thousand in nickels and dimes...
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Another cup of coffee?
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
Who's listening? It's just one college buddy talking to another.
More money than you ever dreamed, Roger. And the thing is no one gets hurt...how bout a beer?
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
How do you know?
My home number's on the back...
Hi sport.
No sir, that would've been illegal...
Mr. Gekko, I don't think I can...go on.
What? How do you know about my father?
I don't understand.
I guess I'll head back...
The three unions. It's 43% of Bluestar's operating budget, the hourly cost of a flight crew is $850 an hour, that's the real hidden value G.G., if you can negotiate that out, get a crew down to $350-400 an hour a run, this airline is gonna be the hottest thing since Texas Air...
What makes you think you can?
It's all about bucks, kid, the rest is conversation...  Bud, you're still going to be president. And when the time comes, you'll parachute out a rich man. With the money you're going to make, your father won't have to work another day in his life.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Hello again, I been holding these drinks for us for the last three weeks.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
Bud, I hate to tell you this but you're a genius!  Darien...lightning has struck! The lightbulb has been invented. Edison, Da Vinci, Einstein are watching...
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
Hi.
How you doing Buddy?
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
He had a heart attack, hon, but he's okay, he's at the hospital...
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
I can't...and I won't.
The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...
Well that's for me to know - but I did enjoy rubbing oil all over that big.
I'm sorry I'm not that good at languages ok?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Yes, it's always been one of my favorites too.
Velcome to ve Vaxverk.
So much.
No.  But once I heard...
Do you really think so?
Whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
I felt...pain.  That she'd been hurt by someone.  This is great.  I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
I am.
How're you holding up?
I'm sorry?
When...when will she be back?
I don't know.
Who?
Um...yes.
Who?  Your husband?
Tell me.  Please.
Your house is so beautiful.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Um...sure.
Yeah.
What's your name?
Wow.
I didn't sleep with him.
We were suite mates.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
How you holding up?
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur.  What's her first name?
I think so
It's alright.
Did I?
Why?
I think three...
What's their name?
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Claire?
How are you?
Maybe we should just...
After that.
That's not what I'm sug--
What do you mean?  Some noises where?
He's here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so Bob Shine introduces us...
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
You didn't?
Get down!  He'll see.
From the sun.  It's a reflection on the glass.
It's her!  I'm telling you.  She whispered and turned on the music.  She's trying to contact me!
When?
There we go.
Harvey says he's amazing.
I never said...
We had a seance.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Sweetheart--
Keep your voice down.
Yep.
You know I am.
Not personally.
Oh God...
It was last year.  We were having troubles.
What?
I don't believe you.
Mmmuh...
:Would you stop it!
Rowan.
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
I hope Ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you're shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
E11ie - Diedre died at five o'clock this morning.    Obviously, there are 1egal matters.  Your discretion will be -
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
What's the matter with you...?! What kind of person are you...?!
You came.    I'm your Aunt Carlotta, my dear.
She was alive all these years... You NEVER let me know her. Who gave you that right...?!
I don't want the -
I 1ove you, Rowan.  I've always loved you.  I only wanted to be in your thoughts. To bring myself into your thoughts - so I could be as we are now.
You're very clever, aren't you...?
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Only you...
Rowan...
And whose houses do you design...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
God knows, I'm intriguing.
Michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Ro - you can't really believe that. Nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  I mean --- that's CRAZY.
That's GREAT!
Mm-hmmm...
No.    This is unreal...
That's cause we're below sea level.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now...  you put me there!
Is that a crack about our singing...?
That's new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  Explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
CHIC MAGAZINE?
BRIAN...
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
It doesn't mention 'females only'
I'm sorry?
So what do you do?
I'm a dentist
You don't know?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I don't know
No she didn't...
What did you do with her?
I don't want to talk about it -
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
Tell me how it happened...
And how did it feel to be rid of him
My sister - My ADOPTED SISTER -
What's wrong?
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Is LESLIE here?
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Nobody knows about your mental retardation.
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
Dead?
Oh, how inappropriate is that!
I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck.
You got everything you ever wanted.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
New Hushpuppies don't make a new man.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Hi, Teddy Bear.
Sorry I--
Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear.
That's me.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
I understand.
How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia?
Most places are, Jimmy.
My new bike.
I came to ask permission to take custody of your room.
You want it in writing?
That's it? I mean, you don't want to order room service or anything? We could play games and watch movies and stuff.
Me-ow.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Not "whatever."  It's two different things.
I see.
It's incredibly simple.
And then what?
I know.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood?
I'm trembling with excitement.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
That's refreshingly deviant.
Tell me more.
Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch.
Do you trust me, Julie?
You're quick. I like that.
You think you're working with chimps here?
The thing is, I'll need a first mate.
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Just a few tokens of my affection. I'll be back soon, don't worry.
Like what?
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
You kicked us off your turf, Merk. Don't rain on our parade.
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
You called the cops on us?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
We don't allow TIPN, Ted.
I do?
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
I told you you could do it.
At our press conference tomorrow, I think we should announce our plans to explore the world. Not just a few leggy 36D's, with blond hair upstairs and down.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Talk to me Artie.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
Kelly.
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner.
Merritt, Forensics.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
No.
Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
No.
Where's this coming from?
Just tell us what happened.
You didn't cuff her?
Shit, what difference does it make... Nobody's gonna believe me anyway...
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
It's those rocks, up there.
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
I wanna live at the beach someday.
My friends buy me clothes, so I don't look like trash.
No you don't.
You didn't have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?
Do it to ourselves?
Hello?
Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
Nellie Gail Ranch...
You're saying that Kelly was raped by Sam Lombardo.
You can't...
That's cop bullshit.
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
That was about as grim as it gets.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Sandy... What's up?
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
You know your Morse Code almost as well as I.
Almost?
All that jumping and kicking.
At least I tried something.
Willard...
Relax.  We're almost there.
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
I know!  I know!
Are those just button buttons or...?
My God!  He's so excessive!
The machine was stopped!  It seemed like a perfect time to disable it! Why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
He was going to shoot me!  Do you mind?!
Your guests, ma'am?
Doyle's the name, sir.  Of the Connemara Doyles.  And there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  That having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  Your friend's already aboard.
Of course, sir, that's why I've assigned a new man.  And he's no ordinary Marshal.  He's quite sophisticated.  Three college degrees.  A master of disguise. Speaks French...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
This is something.
I beg your pardon?
They're coming.
You left me to die, friend.
You managed alright.
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Thank you, friend.
The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel.
Earlier today you tried to tell me something, Willow.
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Say what?
Because it's true.
Who is that girl, anyway?
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You!!
Madmartigan!  You saved her life!
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
You?
She can't be wrong.  She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
I could be you rguard!  I could carry your spear!
That's all I ever wanted!
How am I gonna do that?
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Tir Asleen.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Watch this.  Right between the eyes.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby.  Soon the baby stops crying.  Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  Then his eyes focus on the fire.
This is not going well.
Maybe milking.
Don't let them hurt you.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Johnny –
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
But not a good tired.
Home.
Who are they?
Does anybody know I'm here?
Two days.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
I know.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
That's God's way!
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Everything okay?
John said you're Amish.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
I will be the judge of that.
No, Rachel...
Aunt Em!
Dorothy!  Dorothy!  We're busy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
Look at you, Zeke -- you're just as white --
If she?
Who are you?
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Oh!
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
...Toto, too?
...her face is careworn.
...room --
Oh, no -- no!
That dog's a menace to the community.  I'm taking him to the sheriff and make sure he's destroyed.
Did you say something?
Oh --
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh - I'll get it!
Ho -- ho --ho -- ho
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
I have so got brains.
Ohhh --
Wonderful!  Why, if our Scarecrow back in Kansas could do that, the crows'd be scared to pieces!
Where's Kansas?
What?
...just that the Witch is so wicked. I don't think you two ought to come with me because you'll get into trouble.
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Come on -- I've got another idea.
It's a whatzis.
Whozat?
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
You don't get around us that easy!
No, her dog!
Oh, she bit her dog, eh?
No, sir!
I'd be gentle as a lizard --
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
You put up a great fight, Lion.
So who are you?
What the hell are you talking about?
Nuclear.
Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world...
The King pipeline.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
Since Oxford. I knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. He’s a man of great integrity.
I was the one who brought that money in...
Claude Serrault.  A.K.A...
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Consider me ungrateful.
I met you at my father’s funeral.
I can’t stay.
Vodka martini.
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
What are you talking about?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood. I’m going to redraw the map. And when I am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfather’s name, the glory of my people.
See?  You’re upsetting my customers. What do you want?
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
Where’s the sub going?!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
How appropriate.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Any word from him?
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
Washington?
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Mm hmm.
Jon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?  Dan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks at me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of atoms.
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
I can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to die I want to be with -- other people.
Jon, I do not want to hear it.
Jon -- what??
Jon, where are we?
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
I know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells blood.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
I don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm starting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?
I like the way you look.  It's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change. But you, Daniel, you look . . .
I took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some cows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.
They're following us.
Dan, is this -- is this New York??
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
We should get back --  What?
No comment.
I don't know their real names.
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
The name's Gibbons. You were saying?
Looks like a diner.
Why is that?
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
You're perceptive too. I forgot to add that to the list of surprises. I'm with the National Security Agency. And unlikely as it may sound, I need your help.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
Slick graphics, huh? See these dudes? They're called "Anarchy 99", they're the bad guy bosses.
Next we got a Siberian redneck, Viktor. Into snowmobiles and snowboarding. So naturally, he covers prostitution and the drug trade.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
"Anarchy" 99"?
Like what?
I'm from L.A.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Aren't you afraid?
Toadies right behind.
You can't talk to it?
Why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.
I can see that. Why?
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
We all do.
What are you talking about?
I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep.  Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
Yeah?  Well I don't like to talk about my past.
The intention of registration act -
Who?
Now that's Magneto talking.
If she held on any longer she could have.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
Still trying to make the world safe for our kind.  Still trying to find a way to introduce ourselves -- definitively.
You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?
Oh, shit.
Forgive me for intruding so late at night, Herr Baron.  But an ugly rumor has it that there are strange goings on in this castle.  These good citizens are ready to rip you from limb to limb unless you can offer some rational explanation for their fears.  How say you?
From your office, sir.
Bring me some surgical gauze, a little tape and some disinfectant.
But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
Still happy you married me?
MMmmm.
Hello...?
Well... yes.
Yes.
Very....very!
Darling!
Darling!?!
Ready, darling?
I don't want to spoil anything -- I just want to top it all off.
Would you want me, now, like this, so soon before our wedding? ... So near we can almost touch it? Or wait a little while longer, when I can give myself without hesitation?... When I can be totally and unashamedly yours??
You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring.  I'll leave it on the table here.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
One week -- I'll see to it, sir.
A piece of what?
My father was a sick man.
No, it's pronounced Fron kon steen.
No, Fred ereck.
Well, they were wrong then, weren't they?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
I'm sure we will.
This is Inga.  They thought you might need an assistant temporarily.
Are these your bags?
I thought you wanted to.
Did you hear that strange music?
Did you see anyone else down here?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Why?
But you did -- I just heard it.
You can say that again.
No, no!  That whole thing!
Yes, Master!
How do you know it was a 'she'?
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
That sound good, boss.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
MMMmmmmmm.
Whatever it is, it's coming from down there.  I'm going down to see.
And look at this, Doctor!
Right here?
Just passing through the night.
Yes, I know.
It wouldn't be fair to her.
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
Look how far we've come.
How do you know they're done?
Yes.
Yes, sir, name, please?
Do you have a reservation?
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.

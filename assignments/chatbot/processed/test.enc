Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Sure have.
Hi.
You know Chastity?
I was?
No
They do to!
Is he oily or dry?
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
I'm missing something.
Who is she?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
What makes you think he'll do it?
I thought you hated those people.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
Where ya goin?
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
How'd you do it?
We don't chat.
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Pick you up Friday, then
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
What's this?
Okay?
I know, just let me sleep
Kat! Wake up!
Busy
Maybe.
Who?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
The Partridge Family?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So what's your excuse?
You up for it?
No, I won't go with you
My grandmother's .
It wasn't like that.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Right.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
Is that all that interests you? Gold?
You can see for yourself.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
She said yes.
Can't you stay with us a little?
Really?  God... I wouldn't know where to start... and yet...
Chief says -- he has a God.
The calculations of Toscanelli Marin de Tyr, Esdras...
You mustn't give way to despair. You must wait.
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
Colon!
In Nomine Patris et Filius, et Spiritus Sancti.
How long?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Then, what do you suggest, Don Sanchez?
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
...delusions and paranoia.
What about Oleg?
But it's...
This is not about money, Emil.  I need your trust in me.
What else do you need?
Yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  And my father blamed me for her blindness...
I'm from a small town in Slovakia.  Like the South here.  The Police is right, a civilian is wrong.  So I fled.
Yeah, right.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Vodka tonic.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
This isn't homicide school.
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Of course.
Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about?
She's fucked.  Even if that story is true.
Look - let me talk to her.  Any leads I get, they're all yours.  Just let me have a first crack at her.
My point exactly.
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
So...who's Nicky?
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.
Promise?
Tonight.
Okay.
See you later.  Good luck.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
How old are your kids?
So what's unique?
That's unique.
You stuff sausage in it.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
Where is escort service?
Yes.
Please join us.  Come on forward.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!
Whore?
I did.
You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we?
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
Did you hurt her?
I can get you a job.
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
I know.
Well, he...
A cheap hotel.
I'm here for movies.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
What's that on your forehead, Max? That's a nice attention getter.
Mouth's clean, too.
Clean?
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
Your doctor?
You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
CONTINUED
CONTINUED
Right. Just a sec.
Yes.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
But not completely inconceivable?
Are you reasonably awake?
Two more.
Hal?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
And don't you worry about it.
Yes, it is, Hal.
Hal, I'm in command of this ship. I order you to release the manual hibernation control.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?
Yes, I know that sweetheart.
I'll wish you a happy Birthday now and I'll see you soon. All right, Darling?
'Bye, 'bye, now, sweetheart.
Berkeley told me that they think it came from contamination on a returning Mars flight.
And your charming little daughter?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Please, it really doesn't matter.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Right. Hal, tell me whether the following statements are true or false.
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Yes, Hal, what's up?
Maybe you shoulda stole a better truck, Tonto.
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
Hello, again.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.
How about it?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
It's the only way you're gonna get Ganz.
This prison gives out $400 suits?
Yeah.
Quit playin' cop and undo this cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this man.
I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam gun.
Thank you.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
That wasn't necessary, buddy. I got this under control.
Naw, you'd just call your pals back to bail you out one more time.
They saved your ass, convict.
Not likely, convict.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
I suppose you'd never be like Luther and let a woman get to you...
Maybe Luther hopes Ganz'll give him a piece of your money...
That was in style a couple years back, man.
Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Partnership?
Thanks.
Yeah...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
He's got more brains and more guts in one corner of his asshole than any cop I've worked with.
That's what you say, Cates...
Tell me that's not the same guy.
What'd you do?
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch.  I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
No, it's I'm just surprised you called.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
So what?
Usual bullshit.  You make one smart move and everybody wants to be your friend... You know somethin', shootin' guys sucks. Especially compared to this.
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Can't complain.
Don't mess with me. How much?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Of course.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
What are we going to do?
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
How do I look?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Have you pulled yourself together?
Hello?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
I thought you were divorced.
You hear that?
Cornelius..
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I'm so very sad.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Why?... Why would you need me?
Have you identified it?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's our deal coming along?
How's the detective business?
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
Sure.  I'll call the guy.
You owe me an explanation.  You can't treat me like this.
Because somebody just fucking called me and fucking laid it out!
Is it?
Look, he's got nothing to do with this... let him go...
Any good?
What did you do with her body?
Don't think I won't.
I'm listening.
Of what sort?
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
You found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? Wanted them to find you one.  Well, they didn't find you one, Longdale, they went out and made you one...
You're asking me why?
Why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?
You almost went over your limit.
Big date tonight?
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
How much?
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Where does he sell it?
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
What's next?
Look... that's awful generous and everything...
Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
It won't work like that.
Okay.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
Yes... ?
It got to be too much for him.
There wasn't one.  The police looked.
It is possible... and I know this isn't something you want to hear. Your daughter may have tried to hide a note where she thought you would eventually find it, but where she knew your husband would never find it.  She might have wanted to tell you something...
Okay, I'll take it all.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
I daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  Remember you're in control.
You've been up all night?
That obvious, huh?
No, don't!  I gave Sheila to him and now she's dead!
No offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
Then what else can we do?
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
I don't get it.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
I've got to go.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Have you visited the little boy on my floor?  Jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
What's that got to do with it?
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
Are you alright?
Give up, Mark, it's hopeless.
I thought about that.
Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?
But I've seen her grave.
Who?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Perhaps.  But the idea of willingly going to <u>school</u> to spend my <u>life</u> at a Paleozoic pastime that should have disappeared with the thunder-lizards - I'm referring to War - <u>that</u> strikes me as the <u>worst</u> cowardice of all - being spiritually yellow!
Unidentified Flying Objects.
However our ideas disagree, as I've said before, I'm <u>not</u> a coward!  And it happens you've got no choice:  Either <u>I</u> take you down there, in the Lungfish, or you don't get there -
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
You've got to let us try, Skipper --
Yeah?
Is there any way out of it?
Seems to be all around...
What about down?
Something wrong?
Excuse me, Captain - there may be one last, desperate chance - a one-in-a-thousand shot...
It doesn't seem possible, but - could it be an electrical storm center - ?
Suppose our theorizing is correct? Then this <u>could</u> be the next danger point!
....in such a way as to prevent his returning to it and, as you put it....  ...'recharging his batteries'?
Who with?
You're sure it's Cyclops?
Straight to the Pole - at almost fifty knots!
Why not me?  What am I - the closing act?
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
How soon?
You heard the news.
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley, I know where those suckers are. Rain or shine, snow or no snow. I know deer. We'll kill us a buck today. Guaranteed. Before ten.
Pitcher. "Best ballplayer to come out of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk."
Safety on?
Yeah.
I thought I told you to move that truck!
How'd you get the job?
Where'd you get the blood?
You know.
Break stuff?
It's not funny now. I'm a cop and I gotta listen to all the complaints people make. I'm not a kid anymore. You change.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Are we going in this?
I want to go home.
You don't want the extra police pay?
Fuck you.
Huh?
He more than likely just shot himself in the foot or something. That's what usually happens.
You want me to follow them to Littleton?
The key, Wade.
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
You ever come to your father's grave anymore?
We should talk.
Did you get his number?
Good. Who?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
What the hell are you talking about?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
I was... I'm Wade Whitehouse. I was wondering, is your husband here?
His office. You mean my old office.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
You! By Christ, you -- I know you.  Yeah, you goddamn sonofabitch, I know you. You're a goddamn fucking piece of my heart!
Everything you know is from me.
Where the Christ you going? You sonofabitch, you leave my fucking truck where it is! I need... Give me the Goddamn keys! I need to get me to town!
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
Pointless to stand around in church with nothing to do, I guess.
No thanks. I don't drink.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
They wouldn't deal with a guy like Jack. Who else benefits if Twombley is suddenly dead?
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Alice...
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
Some kids were teasing you?
Mom?
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.
Oooooh, I'm good.
How you doing, sweetie?
Got it.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Got it.
Uh, we got a problem here.
They aren't answering their hails.
Can we do that?
That's affirmative.
The rest of the secret service?
Not even close. Hell, we can't even make Syria or Iraq.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
You don't know the half of it.  Did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  We could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
That was war.
Jim...
The taste of defeat is bitter, no?
Twenty minutes?
Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. What you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
I miss you. And I miss her.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
The fax machines.
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Yeah, right.
IT'S OPEN!
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
What is it, Mary?
Dunn.
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted!  What are you...?
What are you doing, Ted?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
That's right -- premature ejection.
Are you afraid?
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Negative.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
He's a boy dog.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Thank you. Cream?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
Captain, how soon can we land?
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Elaine!
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
But if you'll just give me...
Rain.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
We have a visitor.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Good-bye, darling.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
I know... Why don't you hang around for a while, let me entertain you? It's Matt, right?  Now tell me the truth, have you ever... made it... with one of us?
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Look at your dildo partner.  He's too scared to even come down to the sand.  You're not gonna get wet standing here, moron!
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
Let's talk Hubley.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
What is this?
Why'd I do what?
Screw you.
Where'd you get this?!!
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
Harcourt is dead.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
What is it?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Watch the driver.  I'm going for a better angle on the door.
Get outta there!
Movement!
Position?
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
That's right.
If I go.
I hope you're right.  I really do.
What rank?  I believe Corporal Hicks has authority here.
You sent them out there and you didn't even warn them, Burke. Why didn't you warn them?
All right, I guess.  One hell of a hangover.  Look, Ripley... I...
Sir?
Yes, Hicks?
Is this going to be a stand-up fight, Sir, on another bug-hunt?
Seventeen meters.
Removed surgically before embryo implantation.  Subject:  Marachuk, John L.   Died during procedure.  They killed him getting it off.
Newt time then can walk right up and knock.
They'll get us.
What's this?
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
It's inside the complex.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
You promise?
I guess we're not leaving, right?
Come on.  Crawl faster.
I knew you'd come.
Look, I can see where this is going.  But I'm telling you those things exist.  Back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  Thousands. Do you understand?  I suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  Find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Oh!
Looks and talent don't always go together, Katherina.
Extremely clever.
Why what, sir?
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
If His Grace is not satisfied with me, he can dismiss me.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
My Stanzi - look at her! Isn't she beautiful? Come on now, confess, Papa. Could you want a prettier girl for a daughter?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
Wolfi.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
No one.
Really?
Then he didn't send you?
I was at hand.
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
How much will you pay him?
Where's our friend?
I'm paying these people. Do you realize that?
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Really?
Just one year.
May I try it?
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Majesty!
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Ah, love again.
Well, what do you have for me today?
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
That's not what I hear.
Pupils?
Yes.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
No, really!
Father -
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Why? What has happened?
What medicine?
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Is he working?
Wonderful!  He liked the monkey, didn't you?
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Why not?
It's a miracle, Herr Mozart!
Really?
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
It's unbelievable! The Director has actually ripped out a huge section of my music. Pages of it.
I know; it's outrageous. Still, if the public doesn't like one's work one has to accept the fact gracefully.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
How long will you give me?
This is only a vaudeville.
No! No, it's him!
Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
What?
Confutatis Maledictis.
It couldn't be simpler.
I think so.
C Major. Sopranos and altos in thirds. Altos on C. Sopranos above.  Vo-ca, vo-ca me, vo-ca me cum be-ne- dic-tis.
But surely the Emperor didn't mean to prohibit dancing when it's part of the story.
What is what?
On the contrary.
I am Father Vogler. I am a Chaplain here. I thought you might like to talk to someone.
That makes no difference. All men are equal in God's eyes.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Ah - you've heard that?
Oh? I thought you did so every day. So speak now. Answer me!
No, you didn't!
Oh my son, my poor son!
Yes.
Well, promise then.
What do you mean - now?
How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
The American? Yes, duck.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Dr. Hirsch?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
What shall we do?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
I thought you were asleep.
I dream of death mostly.
Yes, go on.
Hello. You all right?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Bathroom.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
The next corner we can get a cab.
No what?
No.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Yes.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Nice looking group.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
Oscar, what's the matter?
Matt?
Mr. Dickson in yet?
How are you protecting your depositors? By making a lot of idiotic loans!
We want to talk to you.
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
Good heavens, man! You're not suggesting that I
What?
What's this?
I'm not interested in what you think.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Longer.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
No, sir.
I already told him I was home.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.  Matt, do you realize you're up against something? You're being charged with murder. It's serious, son. Now come on, I know you didn't do it.  But we've got to make them believe it. Come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
No. I won't.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Listen, Mr. Dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. You've got more friends than anybody in this town. Little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. All you've got to do is
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and
It's an inside job. That's a cinch. Whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. Now Brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
What are you talking about? He had no more to do with it than you did.
You were right, Mr. Dickson! Brown didn't have anything to do with it. Here's your man.
Did you get the case for the securities?
Oh, ten dollars
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
He left here about an hour ago and went down to Dude Finlay's joint.
Do you know this young man, Mrs. Halligan?
What time was it?
wasn't anywhere near this place
Where's Charlie?
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!
You can ride like that?
This is healing?
That was because of... the reputation the gang had.
Swear.
Nope.
Oh no...
The Army can hang him.
How many of them did he kill?
Hey!
Beg pardon?
I could use the walk.
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
So what do we do, General Lee?
What are you saying?
I got us through the War all right.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Go ahead to the saloon. But don't get too drunk!
What is it?
Where the hell were you?
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
She's still talking to Jesus.
-- if you stop saying things about my Zee.
Pardon the delay, folks, but we had to get Mad Bob Younger under control!
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Oh yeah.
You taking sides against me, now, Frank?
They're all pinned down. Can't even get to the door.
Shoulda learned with Web. Made it look fun, made it look like an adventure. Got Web killed. Now Jim.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
We know, Ma. Now we got to get you to Doc Mimms.
But still died.
I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
Arr. Hand over your jewels, Missy.
Yep.
Me neither.
Laws don't touch men like Thaddeus Rains. Only justice does.
Zee.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Are you going to be happy here, Mr. James? Without all that excitement?
"Hmm" what?
Stop it. This is just sad.
We're moving you tomorrow.
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
I figured.
Was it worth it?
You been with a girl ever?
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Really?
How can that be?
Mr. Thaddeus Rains, sir, it is a pleasure to have you join us in the field.
Just perfect.
I'll kill them for blowing up my railway!
How did you know?
Can you put men at all four?
What is that?
Listen, you're dating Luis, he's in Arizona. You're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. What could you possibly be up to tonight?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Yes?
Pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in New York.
I'm thinking Dorsia.
Eight?
This is Dorsia?
Is it a what?
Pull out, goddamnit!
What are you doing tonight?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Patrick?
Yes, darling?
Everybody's rich.
It's over, Evelyn. It's all over
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
We never really shared one.
No, no, no.
Eggshell with Romalian type.  What do you think?
How did you guess?
Can I help you?
Doesn't he live here?
Are you sure?
I think you should go now.
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Where are you going?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing.
Dorsia.
Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right?
No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks.
Yes?
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Yes. I don t think I can...control myself.
What are I doing?
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
...to the office this afternoon.
Well...
That's...that's too bad.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
You're at Paul Owen s.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
You're not with the FBI or anything, are you?
Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator.
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
How old are you?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Would you rather I not smoke?
What can you tell me about Paul Owen?
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
Where did Paul hang out?
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
Was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or Satan worship?
No.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
I actually came to see Timothy Price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
No hash browns?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
So who was he with?
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Milo. Why would he --
I remember.
That was -- different.
What?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Right... What's that mean again?
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Milo?
You're living here?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
...When did you know?
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
He's pretty tight with his family.
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Somebody said I'm just another Philistine. With reproductions.
How's it going?
Just once. 'Guess I was worried we didn't have anything to talk about, since work was off-limits. Non- disclosure.
Oh. Yeah.
The wrong place?
Gary, hi.
Hasn't affected his work, though.
All the companies know. The faculties tell 'em. At the target schools.
You know my name.
You're famous around here.
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
But why would they --?
A what?
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Latitude 47 degrees.
Did you tell Alice?
So how'd you like the house?
His Snapples were in alphabetical order.
Heavy graphical background, doing design-interface for Skywire apps.  You'll be working with her.
Can we buy into their IPO? Or is that a Justice Dept. problem?
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes. How did you know?
May I wash you?
Damn. What exactly do you do at Virtucon?
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process.
Yes, I'm having trouble controlling...  THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE!
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
Thank God. Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, hey Comrades?
We won, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
Here's the number of my dentist, he's first rate. Ring him up, he'll look after you.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Why not? It's a question.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil.
My mother's told me all about you.
I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working.
My wedding tackle.
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Do I make you horny?
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Let's go get him!
Well, you know... cows, and shagging.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
You're smashed, Vanessa.
Thirty years of political and social upheaval. The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang.
Do you think she's prettier than I?
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
That's not the way to get ahead in life.
Austin, what's your point?
Are you crazy?
Actually, my name's Austin Powers.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Hi, folks. You're entering a restricted zone. Can I see your security badges?
It's about the sharks. Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List. We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.
What is it now?
An evil petting zoo?
Scott my boy, come here. How was your day?
Virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.
I'm proud of you.
Did you ever...
Did you ever want to?
We don't judge here.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
There are limits?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
... bottle ...
... death ...
Love...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
London. The World Council of Ministers meets soon on global defence. If you can control the weather, you control the world.
I resign.
The Institute ... the funding ...
You.
You killed my husband.
You're mad.
I had a spot of bother at the door.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
And I suppose you're the knight.
I mean your man Trubshaw.  Your bullet-proof waistcoat.  I thought you were just overdressed.
Why should they think that?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Not quite. This is my field.
Barely.
Here's the one that broke the camel's back.
You followed me.
Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
You first.
I'll be back ...
Laying in supplies, Mrs. Peel weather may get very nasty and I've no umbrella ...
Oh, and by the way, I think it's about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
Have you any place in mind?
Our chaperon.
Where's Mother?
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
I see.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. Your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. We need your expertise.
Insane ... ?
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
That's not playing by the rules.
You are, and it's behind you.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
Great car.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Mr. Thomerson.
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
Your whores never showed up.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Give him the works.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
What can I be doing for you?
You're a pimp?
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
You want to share it?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Really?
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
I'm separated.
Olivier's in that, right?
I'm not really hungry.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Who?
No, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
Doesn't work on you.  See ya around, little brother.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
-- I was doin' it! I was up there fucking doin' it. You don't know, man, you don't know what I did!
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
...Jesus, you been carrying that around for twenty years? For christ's sake, you were seven years old! You think he could have heard you in there?
What are we going to do about this?
We gotta go to Rimgale, Stephen.
"You never know till the fire stares you down if you're gonna be --"
So... I see you're still in the neighborhood.
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
-- I work for the city.
Hi.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
What'll you do?
Who's doing this?
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
Oh Jesus Christ...
I want another shot, Sir.
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
And the putty around the door?
Some people say you don't do much of anything when it comes to this case.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Then who wrote the report?
No.
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
I have a job.
Mr. McCaffrey... Keeping busy?
Firehouse.
Stevie? Rimgale's here to see you.
Okay.
What's wrong, Stephen?  C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind.  How's Brian doing?
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
Putty? On both doors?
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
-- Burn them.
Inspector.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
Christ! Shit! I could kill them all with my bare hands.
Who?
Yeah.
Who?
This psycho can.
What case?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
He gots to be did.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
My group we need some exposure. Was wondering if you could hook a brother up?
What's your name?
Certified ladies' man, huh?
DeLa - what's the matter with you.
You can walk away.  We both can.
Good morning, Cheeba.
I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
Ahh, the luxuries of life.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
That ain't funny.
Why?
How you sound?
I'm sorry I'm late.
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I will not be held responsible for these revisions.  These changes are not the way I want to go.  This is an outrage.  This is a sham.  A violation!
They didn't even view a rough cut, just some scenes we quickly cut together.
Good woman.  I trained her right.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Manray!
The point being that him, the networks don't want Black people on television unless they are buffoons.
Just want to say good luck.
Thanks.
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
He's just playing big brother.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light.  This bucket of blood.
Otherwise.  I trust you know the difference.  You're an intelligent woman, finished at NYU.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
Oh, is it?  Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
Mantan, we got a show to tape.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Not at all?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat.
You tellin' the truth.
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
I heard ya lady is wild.
...I heard different, thought that was...
Sleep 'N Eat, what's the matter with you?  Using all dose ten dollar words?
Ain't Jemima on the pancake box?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
You're sure this is a good idea.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
And what?
Stop playing me Sloan.
Don't try to change to the subject.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Have you taken my message to him?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
As much as possible.
As much as possible?
Was he cheated?
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
There's no need...
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?
You smoke, Ray?
Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy Kendall -- seems you killed three people!
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
Do what?
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
So you killed him?
Where have you been, Jay?
Roberto, what the fuck?
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
His chest was hamburger --
They?
That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer --
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
No. I said Dunbar.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
I didn't --
Where are they!
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
Which gives us about five hours. Why'd you call me?
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
You want a confession? Why don't you confess, Bill: people are dead and you don't give a shit about it! Only reason you called me is to protect your fucking job, you know this is your fault --
It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control. You couldn't let him testify, could you?
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
I believe somebody owes me ten dollars --
You're kidding.
Being back here. Gives me the willies.
No bodies, no West...
West?
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Pike never confessed.
What happens to Dunbar now?
You motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! You have chosen to join my Army! This Army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and I will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Great, great. That's fantastic.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
Bloom like a flower?
Or are you too scared?
I'll go in right now and get that eye.
Fine, I will.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did you see that woman?
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Spooning the sherbet.
There was one time when I was eleven...
You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.
I am a footnote in that story. I am the context for your great adventure. Which never happened! Incidentally! You were selling novelty products in Wichita the day I was born.
Your mom says I can't tell you that one anymore. You get nightmares.
Okay.
There's a lot you don't know about me.
I'm trying to make a metaphor here.
It's unbelievable.
I can't imagine any place better than here.
'Fraid so.
Hello.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
It's more than they thought. They're going to stop chemo.
You need to go.
How is he?
Was she one of your teachers?
Is he awake?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he...  In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Hold on.
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Put the fucking kettle down.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
Yes.
What's wrong?
In the world.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I don't want to talk about him.
So uh...
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
You don't understand me.
No.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Whatever.
Why?
No. What? No. I know.
You know the rules.  You do know the rules, don't you?
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
I already tossed that out.  Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
More cough syrup?
Hey.
No, ma'am.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
And, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
What happened?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
She ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
Now wait...
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
You wanna go home?
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
Let go of my arm...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Like a man.
How long... how long I been out?
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Cuz once in a while soil need a change. Corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. So next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. That give off a lot of nitrate. Change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  Sting a bit?
Let go of me...
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Want another?
Could you do somethin' for me?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
I don't pimp that.  You talkin' about who I think you talkin' about, you mean Rae. Rae Doole. Sexy little split tail, like you say. I can't hook you up with that. I got two girls. One ain't in town, the other one pregnant. So... you on your own.
This Rae... you get with her?
Bojo called. Said you got to see your brother at the long end of a broken bottle.
I'm dealin' with what God put before me.
You believe He wants this? A woman chained to ya radiator?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
Yeah, you know you home, old man. You just walked through the door.
I gotta ask you. Why do you think Laz is keepin' you chained like this?
You could put it that way.
Holy shit!
Got in a little accident.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
I think she got to you, pappy.
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?
... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Nick, we can't just --
Getting very weird.
Connie...
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, Dinky Doo And The Don't's.  Let's book, Charlie.  If he starts on Motown, we'll be here all night.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Why the hell not?
I've continued working on the case!
How'd you get this?
What...?  Why?
Because he knows how to get to our man.
It's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
How many men?
Ich said you left.
Maybe I'm a quicker learner.
He drinks.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
I like your friend, Joyce.  You're lucky.
Doesn't speak a word of English. And he won't speak Japanese either. No papers.  The Japanese embassy is very interested.
Why me?
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
If I say no?
He knows what he's doing.
Then go get him.
It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
And what can he do for you?
What, Sebastian?
Like what?
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
No.
When do you deliver your project?
Yeah.  I got it.
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
And what in your estimation works?
Four years.  Which would make her termination date...
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Thank you very much.
Prosit.
No rust?
During the road test...
You're going to be over the limit.
I don't know nothing about it.
Are you for real?
The best.
You'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
Is there anything else?
I can imagine.
You did?
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Black?
Go ahead.
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Don't move.
What desert?
Yes?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Please excuse this interruption.
No, I'm lost.
What's wrong with you?
Yes, I'm right?
Again.
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
What is it?!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
What?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
How long would you need me?
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
What for?
Get out!
Yes!
In the house?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No!  Not crazy!
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Adam?!
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Uh-huh. Adam?
It was at least as good as the sky.
Really?  Okay!
What?
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
How do I leave here?
These are wonderful.
Like a painting?
You're sure?
I don't think so.
No.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Almost all of them.
The recovery is very impressive.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
So, did you buy a movie?
Up there!!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
I'm afraid you've got to.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
Oh, my God!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
Good god.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
You have tranquilizers?
If I...you know...
Calvin?!
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
What did you wish for, Adam?
Should we say a little prayer first?
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
I forgot some of my stuff.
Stop it, you two!
I think...it...works.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Uh, yes, you do.
He left with Sophie.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Yes?
What is this? What color is it?
Is Sandy part of this?
Only you and the photo lab.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Yes? What is it?
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
Shit. You better tell me something.
THEN WHAT?
Thank you. honey.
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes, I like you.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Yes.
What do you want?
Yes.
You called me Jeffrey.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
Shut up. It's daddy, shit-head.
Frank, he didn't mean it. Leave him alone. Come on. He didn't mean it.
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
No thanks.
I don't want to go.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Hey? You like to walk.
What time are visiting hours?
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
I'm going out for awhile.
Yeah, I know.
No. No thank you.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
What do you know about the ear? Anything?
It's a strange world isn't it? Do you know what building the woman lives in?
I've gotta go in.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Yeah, if it opens the door.
You didn't goof it up, but you still owe me one. I want to sneak in tonight. It's Friday, do you have a date tonight?
You really want to do this, don't you?
I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
He got a little jealous.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
What was that all about?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
What did he bring him in for?
Just for him?
Lord's name.
What?
Shit.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
What?! What are you doin'?
Well, we tried ta make friends and she gave me a shot ta the nuts.
Well, the light caught the side of his face for a second. And it looked like he had a gray beard, maybe... late fifties, early sixties.
We're going to turn ourselves in. It was self defense.
Hey Murphy?
Aaaww, shit!... evil woman!
Listen fellas, Y'know he's got 'til this week's end. Ya don't have ta be hard asses, do ya?
Asshole!? I'm not the rope-totin' Charlie Bronson wanna-be that's getting' us lost!
Oh, we're good man.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Now, you will receive us.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
For if you do, there will come the day when you look behind you and see we three. And on that day you will reap it.
Only two did the shooting.  So what are you thinking, Russian retaliation?
I felt it would bring closure to our relationship!
Pee...Per...Man.
So what are you thinkin' here?
He was the only one done right. Two in the back of the head.
Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen to the protocol of the porno industry, as I'm sure you've never been in one of these places before. A man goes into the booth, puts the money in the slot. The dancer gets it on the other side. She hits the button, door goes up, now there is only glass between you and it's  little fireman time.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Witness?
What if it was just one guy with six guns?
Oh my god!
It's only 11:00 here boys so I got lot's more drinkin' ta do with your worthless relatives down at the Anvil.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Fuck you!
Hello?
Yeah. Anybody call for me?
Roc. You okay?
You bet your ass he will.
You believe?
Has he now?
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't see.
Have you no fear of God?
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
Hey, Rocco, wait. Come back here.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Why?
That doesn't make any difference. I bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. They have a very special value for her.
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Did you see that?
Dignan, it's got an alarm.
That sets it off.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?
Is it back in?
Yeah.
What do you think?
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
See if mine are in there.
I'll say it.
Actually. If you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
Yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
I don't think we need any keys, Dignan. I think I can hotwire a car for us.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
Dignan. Take it easy.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
Roger.
Any activity?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
I'll see you there.
I'll see you there.
There's not enough time.
I don't think so. I mean. Actually, he robbed Bob's house.
What do you mean?
Have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. Bob and I'll --
Congratulations. You passed the test.
This is good.
Future Man.
Did you ever steal a car before?
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Hector woudn't do anything.
Where you going?
Why not?
Were you adopted, Bob?
My walkie talkie's busted. I can't tell what's going on.
It's in the driveway.
Uh-uh.
Let's go, Abdul-Shabazz.
I don't know why the fuck we're having a party. The damn job's not over yet.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
That's my responsibility.
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
The cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
I don't know.
I can't do that, Bob.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Just get in the car, Bob.
It's not your decision and he's not your brother, Dignan.
Come on, Bob.
What's wrong with Applejack?
What's that?
Do they let you --
I'm working on it.
John, I'm twenty-six years old I didn't run away from home.
He said you ran away from home.
Is he in?
Where?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
You a good pool player.
Will it track back to us?
He left yesterday on the night train. He's probably just getting in now.  You'll have to hurry.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
I've already got a team there. I doubt Bourne's in Naples to settle down and raise a family.
My ass he does. You're playing with fire, Pamela. Marshall said nail him to the wall. I don't know how you interpreted that, but I don't think he meant repatriate him.
Sorry to wake you.
What do you have, Danny?
There were two charges, they were supposed to go off simultaneously. The second one, the one that didn't go off, was down here...  First of all, this is nothing, it's a sub-line for the breaker above. Second, why put the charge all the way down here? If you're good enough to get in here and handle the gear, you're good enough to know you don't need this.  Bourne would know.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
Is this really happening?
So why didn't you kill me then?
What do you want?
Pamela Landy?
-- where's left to go? --
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --
Where are you going?
My first job.
Where am I?
Who's going? Us?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
Still...
How long have you worked for the agency?
Me? Four years.
Good luck.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Is it fresh?
I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
So?
Anything?
But... what will you do?
Peace?!
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
Longshanks promised!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
I rest.
Your dreams aren't about freedom! They're about Marion! You have to be a hero, because you think she sees you! Is that it?
Three, maybe more!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
I still say this is no test. A catapult can throw a stone farther than a man can.
All right, Father, I'll ask him!  If I risk my neck for you, will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
No. He did not.
Your father doesn't like me, does he?
Thank you for inviting.
I'll invite you again, but your mother thinks I'm crazy.
Then when?
And I with you. But you must wake.
I need you so much! I love you!
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
I am trying.
Then tell me what a king is! Is he a man who believes only what others believe? Is he one who calculates the numbers for and against him but never weighs the strength in your own heart? There is strength in you. I see it. I know it.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Mrs. Treborn! I need to speak with you!
Look, Andrea, I'm sure he'll test negative for brain disorders. But there's something else you can try to monitor his memory.
We're gonna be late again.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
I don't know. These things take time.
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Weirder than this?
I can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I'm on the ground in the woods.
Get dressed, Thumper, you're taking me out for my birthday.
Huh?
Oh God... what did we do?
Not if you remember my dad.
Of course.
I know, but...
Like how?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Oh? There's proof now?
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Where are we going?
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
We'll find out soon enough.
Come on, go on...
Just get out, didja?
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
Monsieur Rick?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Yes, I'll bet.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
And you want to know --
Nobody ever loved me that much.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
-- Tonight he forgot.
I'd better be going.
Er, my check, please.
Er, goodbye, sir.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Yes, something.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
And Mademoiselle?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
That's too far ahead to plan.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
How did you get in?
Richard, I had to see you.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
No.
And then?
But why my name, Richard?
Because you're getting on that plane.
It's been a long time.
Ilsa, I --
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
And I congratulate you.
We'll come again.
Good evening.
But we made a deal.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Yes. What is it you want?
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
You will give us the names?
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
What, again?
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Oh, but I just told you. --
Okay.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
You think of everything, don't you?
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Make it official, if you like.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are my eyes really brown?
Put that phone down!
No.
Yeah?
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You've had today's water.
Get water!
I'm lost.  Goodbye.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
That's death knocking, knocking on your door.  Crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
It's real.
Keep painting.  Promise me.
Sonofabitch!
Cold.
Merry Christmas eve.
Hey, look at you.
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
I have to.
I didn't want to.  It just happened.  One day Gary was there.  He took care of everything.  He took care of me.  I was a mess.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
What a journey you've had.  It seems more than a person should have to bear.
Trying.
Who is this?  Where is Kamal?
What's going on down there?
I'm touched.
What?  Let Paris hold its plane?  Let Memphis take care of it?  Let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
You know what your problem is?  You just see the packages in front of you.  You don't see the big picture.
I didn't know we had sailboats.
God damn!  God damn!  Chuck, it's you!
It's me.
That's all there is.
You want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  That's what we do.
I need to do it.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Let him try to *make* some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
He *smells* like he could put you to sleep!
I'm *not* a doctor!
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
You cook very well!
It's time somebody ate *them*.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.
Oh...
So. Not bored yet?
But you looked as if you liked it.
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
I never *asked* for any responsibility.
I *know* this was right.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
Nothing.
He's *alive*. He still loves you.  So do I.
You mean somebody asked?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
First pregnancy?
It's obviously an aborticide.
I haven't read that.
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
I'm happy I amuse you.
Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
Good-bye, Arthur.  Homer, I'll see you tomorrow?
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
What's that?
I'm not in trouble.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
Then it's malaria?
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
Don't this place look like home?
*What* view?
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
Where do you think you're going?
So, what do you do?
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
Ten percent. Of how much?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
It's all about the money, isn't it?
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
Nice.
Luck's a funny thing. Especially the bad.
Like what?
Guess so.
What? I can feel you looking at me.
How much we going after?
Why?
What do you need from me? Permission? Go! If you can fleece him for two million, then do it, Kid.
I need you to stake me.
Come here. Feel this.
No thanks. I'm good.
Sorry, I --
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
You get an equal cut.
What do I have to do?
We're getting down to the wire. Apparently another company has a similar product in R&D right now. If they beat us to it...
Not in that repressed anger sort of way.
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
You are such a raving pussy sometimes.
Hey, we fucked once, honey. That hardly makes you a good judge of character. And don't think I didn't know you were working some angle with that either.
What about...
Tick-tock...
It's bad luck.
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
No. Big con. One rag. One rag and we get out from under all this. But we need another Shill.
Is it all fugasi?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck...
Excuse me? I believe you're holding something far me under Pearson.
What'd he say?
Sorry. What?
Can I speak to you in confidence?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
You guys awake?
You trust this Moonan guy?
How about five hundred.
Eight-fifty.
All right. As what?
Habib?
Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here...  It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business.  Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
Not entirely.
You're my prisoner.
You're my conscience.
He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
Really?
Nothing about you.
I hate public transport.
Don't let yourself down.
I've lived there.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
You're serious.
And I thought you were only after my body.
Let it go.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Ross.
I'm Lucy.
Where do you live, Jack?
And the girls?
I'm off. I need to sleep.
I make it six.
I don't gamble.
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
She's not in the gaming business is she?
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
What's he doin'?
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
What was that, I didn't hear...
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
Fuck that shit.
Well, it is kind of a long shot...
Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil Nebula.
Quantum is up thirty-five.
Thanks.
Energy shielding positive function.
Do you remember the detonation time?
Huh?
The only thing which exists is myself.
In other words, all I really know about the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical connections.
Now, bomb, consider this next question, very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?
That is correct.
Of course not.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
Ah, what'd you say, Pinback?
Pinback...
-- open circuit breakers --
Must get lonely being up here so much.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Doolittle! Help me.
Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
Oh yeah?
What was that, Doolittle?
That's correct, sir.
Commander? Are you still there?
We're running out of time, sir.
Oh, yeah?
I never woulda done it.  Probably not, anyway.  I mean, I actually think you're pretty cool.
That's not why we're here.
Call the skank now or I start redecorating.
None of your business.
Leave.  Now.
You mean until you showed up?
It's a sweep.  C'mon.
Nobody there to sign for it, mon.  What's a bruddah s'posed to do, ride around all day with the damn package?
Where'd you clip this?
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Your daughter's the only leverage they have to keep you quiet.
Mommy, I'm scared.
Original Cindy, say hi to my good friend--
Girlfriend?
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
How do I know you didn't?
It's alright, Peter, we're fine.
Look, if I made you nervous or uncomfortable or creeped you out--
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
I need to find this technician, or anyone else who knows about Project Manticore. They would've used surrogate mothers to carry you after the in-vitro work... If I can track down one of them.
I already don't like the sound of this.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
She's put her life on the line, and her faith in me.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
Well, not me personally.
My name's Lydia.  And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
I got a hit on the car.  An oh-five Tahoe, blue, with Wyoming tags... AGT349... It wasn't easy 'cause you were off in one of the numbers.
Then what?  That's it.  That's all I got.
Nothing so far from arrests, hospital admissions or coroners.  This kind of search...it's heavy spadework.  I'm gonna need--
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.
Sure you wanna be havin' this conversation over the phone?
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Yeah.
Can you put that in a bag or something?
I'm the victim here.
She's as much as said so.  But she doesn't want to share her toy with anyone else... It's just an ego thing with her.
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
Easy Sketchy.
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
More like deployed in bed asleep.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Huh?
Gin.
Better ease up then, Hawk. Wouldn't want to give you whiskey dick would we?
No, I mean... you love your son?
We've got to take this slow...
Nah. Once I get my own wheels, I could come up all the time.
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Cool, bro, now listen up...
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Dude, this is all I got.
What's gone?
Cool.
Don't worry about it. They're perfectly safe. We can pick them up after school. My mom won't be home. It's no problem.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
I said, I'm sorry!
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
Hey, take it easy, man. This is the girls' crapper, remember?
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Oh, yeah! You and what army?
Gimme your gun, boy!
Dr. Monnitoff?
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Beg pardon?
When you fall asleep tonight, I'm gonna fart in your face.
"The Last Unicorn!" By Samantha Darko.
Well, if you're innocent, then you have nothing to worry about.
Where did you come from?
I want to show you something.
Why do they call you Frank?
We went to a hotel.
I mean, the whole sanitation thing. Joseph Lister... 1895. Before antiseptics there was no sanitation, especially in medicine.
Where are you going?
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
And what?
We're moving through time.
So, we call them... IMGs.
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
People aren't that simple.
So how was school today?
Where it came from?
You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
Where are you going?
How so?
I asked you about school.
I just turn the volume down and think about fucking Alyssa Milano.
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
Nothing.
What else makes you feel regret?
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Because I'm so horny.
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Thank you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
I got in. I'm going to Harvard.
Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
Kitty...
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
You-betcha.
I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I never liked her, but she didn't deserve to die in the belly of a swan like that. The whole thing's just kinda sad and lame at the same time.
Go on! Get out!
Mom!
Okay. Yesterday I... I got this picture. So I kinda, y'know, I'm thinkin' no. I'm gonna, I -- I -- I'm gonna quit the pageant.
Nice mouth you got there, Mom, but I -- I'm not goin' through this again.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Yeah...
Let's just say who should win, who deserves to win is Amber.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Last year? It was, "Buy American."
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
Mom, I just finished the third movement of that concerto I was working on. I put, like, this techno beat on this Japanese folk tune -- wanna hear it?
My dear President...  read it back...
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
You can't say that to the President... Put back "President"... Now let's hear how sounds.
"My dear President"...
Eureka Ammunition Company, Gentlemen. Your shipment of sailor hats arrived this morning by freight.  Gloria, I could go for you in a big way. However, the rifles you sent were a little rusty and I don't say that to everybody.  Have not received last month's drawing account; how come your neck is like a swan.  Yours very truly...
Well, if you don't want your dog why don't you put him in a pound?
He only weighs ten ounces --
Sure.  How much does the job pay?  Sure, if there's a chance for advancement.
That's no good.  I like to work on the outside.  I must have something easy.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
You get half mine and I get half yours.
I don't want to buy ammunition -- we no gotta war.
That's all right -- our men can ride your horses.
With a gun like that you can kill some of your own men.
That's-a pretty good.  I'll take a dozen of them.
Yes, one gross of bullets, two dozen hand-grenades, three kegs of powder -- and throw in some matches.
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
I shall dance for you tonight as I've never danced before.
This is a fine thing to be doing at my age.
Twenty million dollars is a considerable sum...  I'll have to discuss that with my Minister of Finance.
Well, in the meantime, could you let me have $50 personally?
How're ya fixed for ammunition?
I'm sorry we lost our tempers... I'm willing to forget if you are.
The future of Freedonia rests upon you.  Promise me you will follow in my husband's footsteps.
Your Excellency!
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
If it's not asking too much --  For our information just for illustration  Tell us how you intend to run the nation.
Guard them with your life... don't leave them out of your sight...  If the enemy gets those papers  we're lost.  If they don't get them, we're lost.  Can't you see what I'm trying to tell you?  I love you...   Mrs. Teasdale, you're the salt of the earth.  They don't come any better than you...
Fine nothing!  I didn't want war... My plan was to marry Mrs. Teasdale and overthrow Firefly.
If only we can get his Excellency to listen to reason...
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
He fell.  He falls.
DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
Good morning, sir.
Well sir, he's quite seriously deformed, and I fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
Good! How is the patient?
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Are you comfortable here?
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
...everyone has been very kind.
I am very pleased to meet you.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Have you read it?
I'm very grateful to you, Mrs. Kendal. This is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. John will be very excited.
How awful for John.
Is he... dying then?
I'll have to find some more.
...Yyes
Yes!
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
Say "Mmmerrick."
Yes.
Who are they of?
The Children. Where are your children
...my... home?
Stand up, John. Let them see you.
Yes John?
Fine.
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Watery headed bunch.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
"The fifth one this week"!
Halfdan the Black.
No. Don't look... The abyss will suck away your strength.
YOU still want to go to Asgaard?
It is day, of course, Freya.
The Gods are asleep, Erik.
No... we don't...
Is there something the matter with it?
Well, it's not called the Horn Resounding for nothing.  You DO know how to play the horn, don't you?
Of course I like women... I LOVE 'em.
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
I didn't mean to!
What a stupid idea.
But...
Nothing... Halfdan the Black chopped his hand off last night.
I know!
What's it all about?
What are YOU doing here?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
What did he say?
Row!
A magic dishcloth.
What are you talking about, Erik?
Nobody's ever crossed the Rainbow Bridge to Asgaard.
Yes it does! We could be at sea for months.
What do we have to do?
Vanish into thin air?
Listen. I've been in this dump for sixteen years and I haven't made a single convert...
You know, my son, our lord said...
Are you all right?
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
What?
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
Help!
I went berserk in every battle I ever fought for King Harald...
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
Thanks, guys.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
Oh, baby, what's going on?
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
It's pretty.
What do you want to hear?
No. I --
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Let's talk about it later.
I don't want to talk about this here.
You're drunk.
I want to know you.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
But you weren't. I could tell.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
I told her today I need to end it.
Okay.
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
Oh God, how horrid.
yeah?
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
I think I should go back.
Have sex. Y'know --
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I can't stop thinking about you.
What took you so long?
I probably got the same thing as you.
It's true.
Guess what I'm wearing.
I don't know. Panties and --
I might be making a mistake.
How's the chicken?
Naomi.
Okay. I wish you could come.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Definitely!
Sorry. I just --
'kay.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
You better go.
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
And after that?
Mary...
I have a family, Mary.
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Howard, they've disappeared again.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
You can if you want.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Where are the others?
What is Debbie's position?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Why? Why do you have to go?
Are you in show business?
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see,  from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
A job for me?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
Ballast.
From what?
It's holding... She's holding...!
How? The Bridge is gone.
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Pressure?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
We still have pressure. The radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
Dr. Weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
What's the hold up?
We've got pressure.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
The blood came from somewhere, Peters...
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Peters...
I can use the station in Medical, keep an eye on Justin...
Once the ship is secured, we'll bring you on board --
You're in the central corridor. It connects the personnel areas to Engineering.
I can see that, what're they for?
What about it?
What do you want me to say?
Where has it been for the past seven years?
You can't leave. She won't let you.
You want me to believe you're the Devil, well, I don't, that's bullshit!
I'm not the Devil.
You're lying...!
I don't like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. Is the course locked in?
Yes, sir.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
Skipper...
What is it, Smith?
Radiation interference?
We're all here.
What about the life readings you picked up?
To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
Starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? It's impossible.
Miller, come in...
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
He served on the Goliath.
Claire...
Yes, we can see some kind of mist. What is that?
Can you see a body?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
What?
Thank you for that scientific analysis, Mister Smith.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
That's how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. That's how the Event Horizon travels faster than light.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
What are you doing?
I don't think She's real big on hate.
How'd you know it was me?
We need to give you a physical, so we know what got zapped.
You look like an eighties rock band.
What is this? Where's Reed?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
This is your dream, Reed. You should be the one up there.
We had a tough year.
Okay. I've uh, got some questions, from Sue. That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom... like normal...
Time for your lesson, Vic. Chem 101: what happens when you supercool hot metal...?  Ben...
What the hell you smiling at? Just keep your mouth shut, and your mind on those SMBs --
If you behave, maybe next time daddy'll let you drive.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl... the Invisible Girl.
Is that what you call it? "Real"?
Johnny, slow down. Think. You know mom didn't raise us to --
And if he's not...?
Make sure you find Ben, bring him back here. And keep it quiet. I don't need this to hit the press.
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
What?
That's what we're here to find out.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
You always talked about how you liked the kind of man who could approach you... speak his mind. One who wasn't afraid to tell you what he wanted.
Why didn't you say something?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Abort? Reed, I put my company, my name, billions of dollars on the line, and I will not let you make me look like a fool --
What are you doing here?
It's just business.
Uh, Victor, I hope I haven't done something to make you think...
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
You want to work at Carl's?
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Your friends use the pool too.
Yes, sir.
Jeff you have company!
Do you have any ice tea?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Oh. Hi.
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Hey, Rat.
Yo.
Damone. It's Mark.
Did you go home and get it?
Damone! You come here?
Well, I've gotta be running.
I always stick up for you. Whenever people say 'Aw, that Damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- I say 'You just don't know Damone.' When someone says you're an idiot, I tell them 'Damone's not an idiot. You just don't know him.' Well, you know, Damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. And I'm just finding out.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
School.  School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
Naw. Any good?
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
My brother is gonna shit.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
What variables?
It was okay.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
I don't know. I guess so.
Where do you feel like going?
Is this your first time?
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
What's April 16th?
It's John Bonham's birthday.
John Bonham?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
What's the message? My light is blinking.
Yeh. The big guy used to be a major in the Marines.
He wanted the pineal gland.
Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later. Mostly Atlanta. But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe.
A great town, that Vegas. I bet you had good luck there. You're the type.
What?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Don't take any guff from these swine.  Now we need a sound store with the finest equipment. Nothing dinky. One of those new Belgian Heliowatts with a voice-activated shotgun mike, for picking up conversations in oncoming cars.
...and we're chock full of that!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound.
You're doomed. I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub.
NO! Stop talking like that.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
Lucy is looking for you.
Some of what?
I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing.
Please... please... I'm only the maid. I didn't mean nothin!...
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
I will not die because of him!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
You know where it is?
IS IT CLEAR?!
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Hey! Get quiet or get out.
You got something better?
You all sure about this?
You weren't helpin'.
Why do you take shit from him?
We gotta be close.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Oh.
Doesn't your foot hurt?
He's dead.
What's going on between you two?
What's it for!?
Grass. I grow some pot down there. It's no big deal, just something I dabble in. The truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
Holds four.
What!? So you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? No way! That's my god damn truck!
Bullshit.
NO, but I will lock you in.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
I'm in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
OH JESUS!
Do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? Anything?
Hey little bear, aren't you going to join the others?
Are you lying to me?
Putting on my armor.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Face it! Confess it! You're weak!
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Get your clothes on, lady --
Fired?
There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
...Yes.
Harry!
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
But I'll never win that.
Were you an alcoholic?
Were you a drug addict?
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Are you... are you hungry?
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt!
Name?
I wouldn't miss it.
Why?
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Now you're catchin' on. Don't wanna get your Daddy in hot water, do you?
Don't be a rat, Harry.
What?
You don't know what you want.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Oh no...
Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he couldn't die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn't want to die.
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Six months' probation...? You gotta learn when to do battle, Farmer. You're not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
I'll bet.
Oh my God, I look awful.
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
There's just one more thing.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
That would be okay.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Did you expect him to look you up?
Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
I'm back, Mama.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
Where are you going?
I don't believe so.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
Kill you? Hardly that.
I see it before me.
You will honor your promise to me!
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
My mind was not playing tricks. He was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.
I remember the first time I ever saw you. Crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. So beautiful even then.
Victor!
I'm quite serious. Look at all the charity and clinic work we do. Up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
No. But someday.
What now? Writing about it in your journal won't help.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Quite a place.
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
In science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. Our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. Think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. Someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  Any questions?
What is your name?
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
Preposterous.
I tell you what we need, my friends. Forget the symptoms and diseases. What we need is a vaccine for death itself.
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God...
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
What'd you see?
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.
Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
Good night, Alice.
What'll you do when you leave here?
Jack?
It's dead. Try the pay phone.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
I wouldn't know.
Somebody'll see.
Let's go back, Barry...
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
That was the telephone.
I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
It's beautiful...
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
You can't go back there tonight. Not in that stuff. 'Less you wanta get drownded.
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
You said it was just you and your son.
What are you gonna do?
If they get over the border, they're gonna let us go.
What's your name?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
If you're taking people, take me. But my kids aren't going anywhere with you.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in and break it off, don't they?
Why'd ya quit?
Why not, against your religion?
Why are you so agitated?
I'm still stewing about that ape laying hands on me. And that fuckin' bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.
Good for you. Now, since we all believe we're dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt vampires. Do you have a cross?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
My guess is that this little dive's been feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime. This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
It's not a flop house. It's basic and simple. That doesn't make it a flop house.
I swear to God, our father, that when you change into one of the undead, I will kill you.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Mexico.
Creepy guy.
I'm really sorry.
-- you got your microwave --
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What do you want from me? I did what you said.
Richie? You okay?
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
How's it feel?
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
All I'm saying --
Cops.
Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars from on top of a high building. That's about as close as I risked getting. What's the TV say?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
Where's the woman?
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
They're gonna search the van.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
This ain't the time, Richard.
Keep your voice down.
We are?
Where are you right now?
What do you mean?
No, you're not. You're sippin' margaritas in El Ray. But we're not in El Ray. We're here -- getting ready to go in there. You're so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you think the job's down. It ain't. Get back on the clock. That's a fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all likelihood, we'll get fucked with. So get your shit together, brother.
How are you?
How 'bout you?  You are safer in here with us than wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don't do nothin' stupid and we'll all get along fine.  Scotty, you sure you don't want a drink?
In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I take it that's yours.
But are there... I mean, how many...
Okay, but... You didn't have to do what you did.  Not for me.
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant...
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
Across the board, sir.
Permission to leave, sir?
Newberry, get a photo.  South?
What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Should probably ask him that.
The reality is this:  We send far too many men off to war.  I don't need to compound the problem with women.  Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life?  Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
You'll think about my offer?
You don't think she'd be raped if she were captured?  You don't think the threat of rape would be used to leverage the men?
I'll try anyway, sir.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Just a coincidence?
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
No shortage of suspects.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
What about him.
Look.  It's not like you'd be completely out of reach.  And maybe we could call in a few favors, get you stationed at Norfolk instead of Coronado.  There are ways of dealing with these things -- I mean, if people are so inclined.
They're more afraid of you.
Last time I didn't.
Just askin'
'Cool?
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
That's not right.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
You don't suppose this is just part of...
This ain't workin' right!
O'Neil, Jordan.
You knew about us?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
The first female President?
If you were the President, wouldn't that put a little piss in your shoes?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
I don't...  What, someone on base?  A "mole"?
Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
Didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Think we can fit up in there?
He's not going to do it.
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
You're still mad at me, aren't you?
Yes. The first of its kind. I found this blood sample earlier this evening...
Are you okay?
What's it to you?
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
Well, I think you're cute.
Merde!
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
Have them sealed off.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
Seventeen percent, huh? Sounds big.
Don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
Are you looking for this?
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner.
I think we should leave now.
It's Raymond.
I understand.
I just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
Don't speak, Quellek.
"The show must go on."
DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Nothing.
Settle down, Alex...
What's happened?
He's a miserable twit!
I don't know.
... Yes?
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
How did you come to that conclusion?
Commander, you and Lt. Madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. Tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
I just can't believe it. Any of it!  Look at this room!.. They designed it based on the Tuaran Pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  Oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  Computer?
The Beryllium Sphere has fractured under stress.
Negative. The Beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
That possibly... The valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
So our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - A two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
They're still behind us...
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
More to the left... Stay parallel...
Who we are. Don't you think they're going to be PISSED?
It's not the STUFF. I mean, anybody can learn the STUFF...  The important thing is COMMITMNT. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
Because it was on the show!
never doubted you for a second.
You gotta admit, they do love him.
That's it, It's go time.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
But... Inside, I have seen-
Excuse me?
Oh, right, sorry.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Commander?... Call me Laredo?
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
Over three hundred miles.
We're in bad shape, Benedict, moral is low.  Before I can do anything, I need Lee and his seven thousand troops.  I've ordered him to join us three times.  In my last letter I all but begged him to come here. The man is insubordinate.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
Have you heard?  The British are negotiating to make a trade for General Lee.
Yes, General.  But if you have to shoot somebody, you can't.
Yes, general?
No uniforms.  No coats, even?  In this weather?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
Are you going to keep him, sir?
Yessir.
What is this?
I'm not sure.
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
Lafayette is a child!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
We have more officers created by Congress than we know what to do with.
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
These supplies...?
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
General Lee, sir!
It's another demonstration against the king.  This is the wildest yet.
But to go to war over trade, over money?  Surely there's still time for a compromise.
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
To win this war I need an army.
Not today.
They're finished, they can't help us anymore!  They've done their duty, General Greene, now you do yours!
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
A horseshoer?
Nathanael, someone bred to station, bred to being a gentleman -- unlike these men -- his sense of duty naturally prevails over the baser needs.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you!  In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
Africa?  That's so far?  How do they get here?
What do you really think of the minuet, anyway?
You're out of your mind!
I say!
Is that your test of patriotism, George; if a man will die for you?
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.
I guess still in the locker.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Bear. The Colombians are in L.A. Seems they all upset about their money. That ain't enough, as a bonus, it turns out the yoyo was Escobar's nephew.
You keep hittin' him like that, he ain't gonna look like he broke in anymore, he gonna look like someone beat him up and then shot him.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.
So... how many movies you been in?
He's around someplace.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
She's... young.
I can't do it.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
Okay. Then be good enough to hand us our money back, or you think about us coming in on this new one.
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
What?
You found Leo, didn't you? Took the poor asshole's money and put it in a locker, ready to go.  Why haven't you left?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Tough shit, bro. This ain't Miami. You want something, talk to me.
It was C... I don't know, sixteen or seventeen, one of those. Why? You looking for anyway, a bomb or something?
Leo spanked a waitress?
That's what I'm doing.
I know what a marker is.
Karen, say hello to Chili Palmer. Chili, this is Karen Flores.
Wait a minute, you're not the guy, are you? The dry cleaner?
Is that right, that's what you do for a living?
Really? You ever been arrested?
For a movie?
No, his best part was the cripple gay guy that climbed Mt. Whitney.
Anyway, Murray has this shrink, who also happens to be Martin's personal trainer's shrink. Murray gives the shrink the script and the shrink gives it to Martin's trainer who reads it to Martin while they work out, and Martin flips. Loves it.
Lovejoy sits behind the wheel, watching the bar across the street, getting his video camera ready for action...  What's he doing? Following a guy?
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
What?
I had to tell 'em something.
Which also means when I speak, I'm speakin' for Jimmy. So e.g. as of now, you start affording me the proper respect.
You owe me the dry cleaner's fifteen grand plus the juice which is what another, uhh...
What you're telling me, you're tired? You wanna go to bed?
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
They report it to the IRS.
From when? You left Vegas with four- fifty?
Who told you that?
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
It's not one of these?
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
Lemme get this straight, you broke in again to apologize for breaking in before?
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
Well, I gotta have a talk with Leo, my runaway dry cleaner.
And you think the movie business is any different?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
Why not?
Are you going down?
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
He already knew it.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
Hello, Doris.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?
Yeah, what'd he have to say?
Let's not be too hasty.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Maureen.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
I don't know what else you'd call it. He's breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. He's totally unresponsive to pain.  What happened up there?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
How long, then?
What, you think there's something funny about it?
Can't you use something else?
Do what you need to do. Just do it fast.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
What the fuck -- ?
Lights?
You're more practical than superstitious.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
You sure it wasn't me?
Guess that'd be me. Again.
How's he doing?
The ah... the radio's out.
The same day she supposedly went down.
But where's the damage?
It's not gonna hold us.
When you found me yesterday, at the pool. I'd seen... something.  Someone.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
I think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. There's nothing supernatural about greed. And that's what it comes down to, pure and simple.
Yeah.
Whatever the reason, she's adrift and abandoned. We've got every right to salvage her.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
So what? We gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
Fifty million four ways. That's twelve million and change a piece.  What you gonna do with your share, skipper?
I don't know.
Ho-ly shit.
So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
What about the gold?
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
What's this?
How should I know?
Are you going to yell at me?
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
And what can you tell us about this... 
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
What do you mean?
Help me what?
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Hi Josh.
Hi.
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Why do I always have to do it?
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
Are you sure?
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
I don't believe you.
No way... when?
Yeah, well...  So when are you going to get your job?
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
He came into work.
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
Wow... finally.
May I ask what you're doing?
I know it's over, asshole, I --
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
I did too!
Wow!
Really? Can I see it?
Oh, right...
I'm totally serious!
Every guy has a type!
Well are --
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
What are we, in slow motion here?! What are ya, hypnotized? Have some more kids, why don't you?... For Christ's sake, would you move!?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Arrrghhh! Ah Jeez... Christ...
Are you okay?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
That's the spirit!
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Wow!  What was that all about?
Sort of... she doesn't dislike any of that stuff... she's trying, anyway... actually, we're supposed to go antique shopping for her apartment this afternoon...
We really should get together sometime soon... I-I'll definitely call you this week --
Well, you know... what do I know about clothes... I've never been the most fashionable guy -- it's nice to have someone do all the work for me...
What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
God, she's going to kill me... this bottle is half-empty!
I guess I probably used to when I was your age.
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
What do you want?
I-I-I...
Maybe she's got another boyfriend.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves.  We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class.  Who is responsible for this?
Talk to us about it...
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
What do you mean?
Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
Oh, you're a doctor now, too?
There is no reason for fear.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
I wasn't and you know it and don't push it- just listen- we have a problem in Tsavo-
Excellent decision.  Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
You've never built in Africa.
Pleasant journey?
Starling?
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
That's a terrible idea-
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
-well, of course he kept moving- but he couldn't have been more than ten feet away from the three of you- surely you must have wounded the thing-
I've lived in Africa a year and I don't know what you know. How long have you been here?
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
John, it will not be easy.
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.
Thank you, Samuel.
How many cattle?
Okay, whatever you think -- but not Venkman.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Hello, Peter.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
I'll do it.
You mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
You're really good, you know.
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Now you get dressed and we go out.  I got a babysitter and everything.  Trust me, you need it.
It's Janine Melnitz, from my staff.  She's one of my most valuable employees.
Hi, Ray.  It's good to see you.  Thanks for coming.
I think we hit the honeypot, boys.  There's something brewing under the street.
Can I help you?
No, that's what I want to talk to the mayor about.  We did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
You know, I never got to ask you.  Where you from, Johnny?
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
I command you.
Get on with it, counselor!
That's it?  That's all you have to say?
Come on, Sherm.  You're my cousin.  Do this for me.  I'm begging you.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Hello, Venkman.
The New York Pneumatic Railway.  It was an experimental subway system.  Fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
Is the line sinking?
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Who, Ray?
I'm Ray --
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
You should've been there, Venkman. Absolutely incredible!
How deep does it get?  That water's cold and I can't swim.
Nice going, honey.  It was brand new.
Hey, sweetheart, will you CUT THAT OUT!!!
Is that your professional opinion?
No, just that one word -- Zuul -- but I have no idea what it means.
Like a used car salesman.
Well, let's check it out.
Damn!
All right.  What do you want to do?
That's it.  Get out.
He is a very close friend.  Do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
Well, the name Zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 B.C. by the ... What's that say?
Actually, it's more of a policy than a rule.
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
Yeah, it's some kind of mallow-type substance - that's for sure.
Die in what sense?
I don't believe in luck.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
You could say that.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
Yes, it would.
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Who?
What now?
Sorry, Buddy!
What happened??!!!?
What do I say?
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Judgement Day ...
Where are we now, Commodus?  Can you see the camp?  My Gods!  The air is turning into ice!
That's what you told me two days ago!
If I may be so bold...
For the gods, spit it out!
Where have you been?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Welcome back from your great triumph Narcissus Meridas.  My father sends his heart felt praise.  Sadly, Marcus is in dark humors -- nothing to worry about, but he needs rest. Likely just the weather.
Respectfully Caesar, Quintus and I must report.
Caesar, ignore them.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
God of passages and changes?
I've read of it.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
When the Senate and the Emperor agree miracles can happen.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?
Is this Rome?  Are we just going to be executed?
Why do you play at being drunk?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
Tomorrow?
What the hell was all that about?
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
This is our oil from our estates?
I want to come home, of course I do, I'd have to be mad not to want that. It's just that Marcus trusts me.
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
I killed too many barbarians.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
How much money is involved?
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
Fantastic!  Wonderful!  But posters are very expensive.
No.
No.
But, Elaine --
Where is the car?
No, I couldn't.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
What is the matter?
Yes.
I do.
You mean the one who --
Elaine -- I love you.
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
What are you going to do now?
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
I said -- not exactly -- no.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
I am going to call the police now.
I'm in the bathroom.
Did you get a room?
Can I help you, sir!
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
What?
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Why not?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Did you know that?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Her portrait?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
What are you so scared of?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Yes, I do.
Well -- I don't know.
Yes.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
Thank you.
Benjamin.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Wait a minute.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
Do you really want me to?
There!
He's asleep.
Always?
We're talking.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
Not exactly.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
Well I can't.
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Do you remember the make of the car?
Oh my God.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
Why not?
There's nothing to tell.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Well look -- I was kind of upset there.  I'm sorry I said those things.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
Then you'd better start believing me.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
What?
Why did you say that?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
Goodnight, Benjamin.
They don't know?
About what?
Why?
You got me.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Swell. I appreciate it.
You'll never be young again.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
I will.
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
I am not threatening you.
It's Benjamin.
Yes?
Is anything wrong?
Yes.
No -- no -- no -- no...
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
You?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Very little.
Aren't you?
What?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Yes -- I do understand.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief. 
That's a silly joke.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
The Baron is tired?
What?
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Well -- last night was not so good.
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Oh -- but -- I --
The Grand Hotel.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
Everything?
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Yes, of course, -- money!
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
What?
Cotton Company --
Tomorrow morning.
Of course -- of course. 
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Come here. 
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
Scratched --  We did not take the initiative.
Sorry, Preysing. 
You've decided against the merger?
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Come along, oh, Madam, come along. The train will be going.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
What -- what is it? Last night...
Again?
Yes, the police must be called.
Four minutes past. Please come.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
Now I'll ask you another. You think I got no contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. There ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I'm some mark you can blow off!
You wanna talk to me straight up?
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
So here we are!
Not much time.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
I hope you're not too badly disappointed with us, Mrs. Langtry.
Whadaya say?
Kaggs. Home office.
What's up?
No?
I didn't realize. Yeah, you do look a little pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all these years?
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
You're one to talk. Still running playback money for the mob.
Get off the grift, Roy.
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
What's that?
Going somewhere?
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
Just a few bucks.
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
I can't. I just left home.
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Roy?
Mm?
Oh, I am, baby, believe me.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I don't see why we have to take the train.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Nobody does that single-o.
And when he got serious?
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
Bullshit!
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Only the real stiffs.
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Do you know who did this?
Nothing's missing?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
I'm sixteen, Keri.  I should be able to live wherever I want.
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom".  Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
You're twisted.
Nothing.
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
No.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Looks great.  It does.
It's not going to happen.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
Hey, you alright?
What?
Michael Meyers.
I can't believe this is happening.
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't you hold it?
I thought you were allergic to latex.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
He do that to you?
Mom -- Who is this?
I can't.  The voice man is coming to get me.
Relax, John.  They were just kids.
This house is sacred to him.  It's the source of his memories -- his rage.  Mrs. Strode, I beg you.  Don't let your family suffer the same fast as Laurie and her daughter.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
My, God!  What have you done to him?
God, what's wrong with him?
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Come on!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
After six years?  Sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
Notify Haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we're on our way.  I want the entire staff on alert.  We go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  If he is alive, I plan on bringing him back.
This is madness, Wynn.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Samhain.
Yes?
It's a bitch.
At least we found the diamonds.
I'd really feel stupid if we didn't bring anything back home.
Tell them yourself!
You know what gets me?
I know, I know.  I dunno.  At least she's in the same house.  Sure was spooky, looking in the window there, and there she was.
I've been looking at motorcycles.
Go home!
How do you know that?
Wear your uniform and every decoration, and let them despise you, if they dare.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I told you the uniform wouldn't help.
Hi, Penelope.
If what?
Selling vacuum cleaners isn't the best preparation you could have.
For what?
Do you really think that Harold Ryan would go to Africa with a vacuum cleaner salesman?
Look how you're acting now!  This is a moment of truth, and you're almost crying.  Slug me!
Out!  Out!
Hello.
You were about to ask a question?
Ask it!
What's good about that?
What does he do--of an athletic nature?
Oh hell.
Tell me that!  Tell me that!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
You're a very good boy to respond that way.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Penelope!
The smallest thing I've got.
I'm talking to you gently now.
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Seemed the most honest way to begin life together again--natural, unrehearsed.
When I'm dead--  or fucking.
Harold!
Turn around?
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
Don't lecture me on race relations. I don't have a molecule of prejudice.  I've been in battle with every kind of man there is. I've been in bed with every kind of woman there is--from a Laplander to a Tierra del Fuegian. If I'd ever been to the South Pole, there'd be a hell of a lot of penguins who looked like me.  Cook!
You don't know you want.  That's the way God built you!
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Why not?
A dozen?
It's a big and busy funeral home.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
I bought him a twenty-two yesterday--on the way home from Hamburger Heaven.  And where is the good doctor?  Have you two feathered a love nest somewhere?
What kind of a country has this become?  The men wear beads and refuse to fight--and the woman adore them.  America's days of greatness are over.  It has drunk the blue soup.
I'm turning off the alarm.  I'm turning off everything.
Whoever has the gun, you see, gets to tell everybody else exactly what to do.  It's the American way.
You've killed women?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
It's always locked.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
Well now--what seems to be the trouble with the patient today?  A touch of malaria, perhaps?
Pacqualinincheewa root.  Means "cougar fang." Cures anything but a yellow streak down the back.
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
There's a certain amount of information there.
This is man to man.
I can defeat him with anything from flavored toothpicks to siege howitzers.  But he got it into his little head that he could come here and demolish Harold Ryan with words. The truth!  Correct?
What an hallucination!  Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear.  Oh dearie me.
You haven't heard me yet.
I'm high as a kite.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
Don't you laugh even inwardly at the heroic balderdash you spew?
The new hero is you.
Get up.
Thank you--for my life.
New lives begin!
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Leave the rifle here.
Give me your word of honor that that's all you're going to do.
Alice is dead?
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Premature ejaculation.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Don't worry about it.
What's this?
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Don't touch me.
J. Edgar Hoover plays sports.
No.
What does he say to do?
Doing what?
He'd assume we had.
All through the day I'm so confident.  That's why I'm such a good salesman, you know?  I have confidence, and I look like I have confidence, and that gives other people confidence.  People laugh sometimes when they find out I'm a vacuum cleaner salesman.  They stop laughing, though, when they find out I made forty-three thousand dollars last year.  I've got six other salesmen working under me, and what they all plug into is my confidence.  That's what charges them up.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
A what?
How nice.
He said one other thing.  It wasn't very nice.
It's true.
I'm glad somebody finally cried. Every time I come in here and see all this unnecessary death, I want to cry.  I don't cry, of course.  Not manly, you know.  Did she try antihistamines?
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
That's the XKE.
I'd be dead by now if that were the case.
He's not your son.
That's been said before.
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Not true.
None of my relatives are Chinese Communists.  Speak for yourself.
It's good.  Let him go.
Yes, we do.
We only have two members so far, but it's growing all the time.
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
No. I don't think so.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Are you going to stiff me?
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Now, what do you want?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
How many weeks?
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was looking for.
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Joanne?
Something like that. How much do you make?
You don't drink?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
No.
No.
What does that mean?  What does he do?
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
Rot in hell, honey.  He's busy now.
I must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.
Who's paying you?
And better?
I'm only human, you know.
Don't do anything more. I'll find out what I can.
What is it, Jake?
What plan?
We're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
Where does he hang out?
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in... interesting things.
You're talking about real excitement?
Rucker.
Is this with a girl named Kristen?
What do you want?  Do I know you from somewhere?
Where's Ratan?
Do you have a, ah, film called 'Slave of Love?'
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
I'm worried about Jake.
Who's that?
The guy who bought you that ring.
Jake'll take care of me.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
You are at the University, Candy?
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
Yes.
How long have you been driving?
Isn't this your vehicle?
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
Officer, I can explain.
And what do you do, my dear?
I'm a file clerk - Harrison Feed and Grain.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Harold Chasen.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
My door is always open.
Eh, fine.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Look, the ice is melting.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
Okay?
The ice is melting.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
It's so blue.
Well, why don't you?
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
From the guys who got the matches, of course. 
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Don't you advance on me.
Just like this.
That wasn't very scary.
Oh, you weren't scared.
I don't know. Perhaps.
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
It's all right. It's organic.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
To whom?
This is insane.
And why is that?
Just give me a rough estimate.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
No.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Then why did you leave?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Parasite!
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Well, I didn't.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
Sad, huh? She's been here six months. Her name's TIFFANY.
I... I had a visitor.
The box. I need the box.
What do you mean?
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
Nah -- he's taken care of.
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
I do.  How many escapes?  This year alone: five!
Reliquary --
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Agent Myers is your new liaison.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
She's dead.
What are you trying to say?
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Are you sure about this?
Hi.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
Red, I --
Cocky.
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Pardon?
What's the problem?
We're leaving.
Will you sign for the bed?
Got her mother's looks.
This isn't for real.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
This isn't happening.
I don't want to see the dress.
What about Larry --
Wedded bliss?
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
What?
I want an explanation first. I want to know what happened to you.
It's not any box. It's called the Lament Configuration. It's a puzzle.
Hell...
She'll tell them everything...
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty.
What happened?
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?
Just a thought --
Why didn't he want to sell it?
You're NOT going to faint.
Shit.
What's wrong with you?
What?
I suppose that's right.
Well, isn't it?
This isn't the bedroom.
What's wrong?
I found a room.
YOU'D like my room.
Well I want you to see the house.
Great.
What?
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
It's all right, sweetheart. Julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
Whatever Frank did was his error. And it's finished with now.
No you don't.
No. It's all over.
You know I do know the way home.
These THINGS... they want to take me --
Don't let them take me, Steve --
I'll come back later, huh?
I hate to quibble with you Rob, but she married her first boyfriend. Kevin Bannister.
I don't want old sad bastard music either.  I just want something I can ignore.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Not the point.
I wanna date a musician...
What did you tell her about the shop for?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
Just listen to me.  If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Isn't it?
Great!  That's fucking great!  They only asked you to sing because of your name!  You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
You're not even coming?
Fuck off, Barry.
I heard you, man.  Don't give me that "what" shit.  You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
I have all of the others.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite.  Do you have an appointment?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it.  So...  I should really put a James Brown in there --
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
Good.  Great.  Yeah... Wow.  Rob Gordon.  Seems like a 100 million years ago now.
Hey Rob.
Yeah, OK.  I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl.  The one on Testament of Youth.  Never released here.  Japanese import only.
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight.  I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that.  And he likes you.  It's just that --
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
It's Vince and Justin.
Laura?  Are you okay?
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
I think you know that.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
Yeah.  Great.
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know.
I told you I slept with him.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
Don't forget your CDs.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
Pigsty.
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
You know the difference.
Harder.
Hi.
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
What's happenin'.
You called this morning?
How're you holding up?
It's true!
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
So you live in Chicago now?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I knew this was going to happen.
What do you think?
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
Jesus.  That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months!  Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
It's rough.  But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio.  I'll take care of the rest.  I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Well, the cream of society awaits.  If you're ever in the neighborhood...
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
-Okay okay.
It's not mine.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
What about me?
You're wrong.
You've been listening to rumors.
When you finish, what then?
Yes.
It's beautiful.
Who are you?
Not the same.
It's all the same.  Half lives that never go away.
Forget it.
Thanks.
But we might just give it the 'ole college try.  What with the court back ups, it could be days before you got an arraignment. But then, I'm sure the flunk-out neice of the D.A. knows all about that.
Why?
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
Aye.
How can you know this?
You're a long way from Inverness.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
I don't know why.
This can't be.
You will live.  Survive.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
I feel hardly nothing.
You cannot be real, Conor.  You had the last rites.  No man has been cut half as bad and lived.
But I did live.
Who?
Far away.
Finish yours?
Your name?
Staff sargeant detailed me to prepare firewood for the break- fast cooking.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
The last four.
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Had a great swing with his blade. For a Pope.
You're insane.
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Friend of yours?
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
Your murder weapon?
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.
Are you back?
Who is it?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you.  Mervyn, isn't it?
Let him have everything he wants.  Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Sort of a Jack London style?
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
Too hot?
But --
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.

Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
No, you don't!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
You can break it, can't you?
Sure you can. Come on.
Just what I said. That's what I --
I know, Walter, but I --
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.  I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
She jumped out of the window.
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right.  Duffy's getting old!
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Look at me, Hildy --
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello?  I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em!  Duffy!  Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation!  Duffy!!
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Well -- what is it?
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Hildy, darling!
You know me. The shirt off my back.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Gus, this --
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Just a minute, Johnson!
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
Come on with that money!
Where's the money?
You know it is!
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Mother!
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Very simple, Earl.
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
What good'll it do?
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Hey --
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
Why not?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
This puts me in a peculiar hole.
Is it hard?
Look out!
What's he want?
The door was locked.
You miserable little tripe-hound. I'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
What are you doing here? This is our territory
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
I don't mind.
Yes.
Bloody.
You're the biggest fibber.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
It's like telling fibs.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Could you seal it over with hot pitch, Clive? Caulk it like the hull of a ship.
Rosehill Avenue. No roses. No hill. And it's certainly not an avenue.
Don't panic!  Keep your head!
And I'm still just a lad myself.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
What did I do to deserve this?
God, how I hate all this scrimping and squalor.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Really, that's a long time.
Aw, I was going home to my Mamma's house... yeah, I was out doing this thing.
Thank you.
No! He's one of God's creatures, he can't help it if he's dumb... I'm just crazy about animals.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Great story Goober, how much?
What's this?
How long have you been running this place?
Yeah but, she reminds me of this chick that I remember from fourth grade... called a... shit, what did we call her?  Oh yeah, Patty Pee-pee Pants... when ever she got called on by Miss Chumski, this chick would piss in her pants and start bawling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
So, the guy goes to Hell and the devil says, "do you smoke?" The guy say, "yeah"... the devil say, "great cause Tuesday is cigar night, sweetest Cuban cigars you ever had."
Don't panic yourself, way too much caffeine guy... I see a sign.  Captain Spaulding's Museum of Madmen and Monsters... cool. Also... fried chicken and... gasoline... next exit.
She looks like she stinks.
Hey, he moved.
Fine. I'll go straight.
What!
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.
Come on, get with the facts.
Hmmmmm.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Fascinating.
Yeah, doesn't hurt himself, just spins it around next to his eyeball.
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Oh.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Aw, come on. It will be fun.
Yeah?
These dates perfectly correspond with the time frame of our beloved Dr. Satan working at the looney bin. I'll bet he amputated her arms.
Rise and shine.
Aw, it ain't crap... it's... cute.  ...and really who are we to judge the artistic merit of the tin-can Mona Lisa?
Tell me about it.
Yeah, I hit burn out mode back at that old stripper lady's place. Watching her dance around with those ratty-looking animals was ridiculous.
Don't even say it.
What was that?
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Holy Jesus, somebody had themselves a field day beating the shit outta this thing.
What'd ya got there?
Huh?
And I'm gonna help put the razor blades in the candy apples.
Oh, don't blow everything out of proportion.
What are you doing?  ...no, stop... please, please.
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Think... do any of these kids look familiar in any way?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
That's true, Otis... not that we're having a bad time, but...
Fit the profile?
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Sounds like a bad idea to me, probally just get in the way.
Wydell.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Tell him, Harold.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Like father, like son.
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
When you were a little French girl?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
You don't abandon somebody because they have a physical problem.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
Hmmmph.
God, you're beautiful.
Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary.
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Please let me go with you.
He's dead.
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
One night stand?
Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
It looks wonderful.
Boy, this is good!
You really enjoy my company?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Oh, and the sun block?
Fifteen.
Perfectomundo! We are ready!  Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save.
It's perfect!
Who is it?
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
You have to shave? Like an ape?
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
Sure. Of course.
Should I come with?
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
So he's doing okay?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Yahoo!
Oh, I will!  Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you.
Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do.
Unn.
Ounpoo. Ungh.
Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha.
Wait!
Pittsburgh?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
That's right, Miss Packard.
To win.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
Well, we won't.
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How're the hands?
It's a long walk.
Why?
Well... well, now.
How do you feel?
Talk to me, Charlie.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
That's right. When?
You gentlemen care for a drink?
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I'd show you to the door, but I...
Who's he?
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
Try me.
How long have you been waiting?
What bus?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
What do you do on the other days?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
Where you been all day?
At school. It's Thursday.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
I'm hungry.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
No, why should I? It's yours.
What happened?
You wanna drink?
No. You?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Thousand dollars a game.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
That's who you are too, Emma.
Emma...
So, what do you do?
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.
Jim -- what's wrong?!
What did it look like?
I lost it.  It's kind of muddy out there.
I'll take you to school.
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?
She said the frog came from around the Copper Ridge.  She must've been behind the hill.
Jimmy, calm down!  What happened? Tell me what happened!
I don't see anything.
No.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
George, where have you been?
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
What do you want me to do?
We're losing them.
What's the bad news?
What're you talking about?
What happened?
Okay, why did I just send my family to Atlanta?
David, I've been meaning to talk with you. It's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
They don't know this.
This, pops, is every phone book in America.
What'd I say?
Nice meeting you.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
With your permission, Mr. President, I'd like to remain my your side.
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
How're we doing?
Pilots, sir. We don't have enough people to get them in the air.
Be careful.
You're late.
He's my angel.
Was his father stationed here?
I shouldn't have left her.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
But, Mr. President...
My reputation precedes me.
I don't know. But someone must want it pretty badly.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
Tell me, what's going to happen when we get to Venice?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
The Arthur Legend. I've heard this bedtime story before.
Eternal life, Doctor Jones! The gift of youth to whoever drinks from the Grail.  Oh, now that's a bedtime story I'd like to wake up to!
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
It would make me very happy.
Don't wander off.
At least I let you tag along.
No?
All I have to do is squeeze.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Don't call me that, please.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
He was actually there? You saw him?
Well, what was left of him.
They want my diary.
You did!!
What?
You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
My Diary's in Berlin.
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
What does that mean?
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!
The penitent man is humble before God.
But, Indy --
Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
Charming.
You think so?
I believe we're being called to dinner.
What?
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
There are no stories anymore.
Their stories are just fear and folklore.
Lao She.
Indy, they make our plane crash? To get you here?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Hasn't the Pankot palace been deserted since the Mutiny of 1857?
I don't understand. What's happened here?
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
Look out, damn it, I need that antidote!
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!
You all right?
Dream -- nightmare is more like it.
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Okay, I want you to lift your hand -- and pet the snake.
What does the writing say?
That's Shiva? What's he giving the Priest?
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
Couldn't keep away, huh?
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
I'm reporting you to the .....transit authority!!!
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
Loading a gun.
You're not crazy.
I'll tell you what to say.
Anyone there?
What do you mean we.
Think of the scientific data we'll gain. Come on, lets get out of here.
Door's locked.
A lab and equipment.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
You mean...just leave.
What about money?
I can't do that.
It's just not enough.
The beach?
Why not?
What's happening?
Don't just stand there, say something.
Touch her.
I made it work.
Well you did it today.
Mind your own business.
It is my business. It's my name.
You got a better idea, you tell me. Other than her, there's no one here I know.
I feel like an idiot.
Just don't show fear.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
Can't tell. Every time I try her, you look away. Or you make noises. Maybe you don't want to know.
What is it?
Oh come on.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Bingo.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
What do I do?
Follow her.
What do I do?
One of your instincts?
...drink it.
What next!
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
What exactly?
Where've you been?
We are in a dungeon. How do we get out?
About what?
She works for them.
She is beautiful.
I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
Don't worry, I owe you a lot. I'm not gonna let us rot here. I'm gonna find us a way out.
I'll get us out of here.
It'll remind me of you.
What part what?
**?!! 
I have a new client.
That crazy guy?
Oh...that's okay.
When you do...
Do what?
Fine. You look fine.
We're here.
Here?
Now, Joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
Who?
Now you know what I know.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Is someone else here?
You mean from it.
And you?
That you're not crazy.
No. Ryuji just hires us.
Who else is interested in me?
Why did they leave?
Hiroshima.
Oh sure.
Then why are you smiling like that?
Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
What's Gruner like?
We figure out if it's in here.
That must be him. Water taxi.
Hong Kong.
I encouraged you to come here. My fault as much as yours.
Do something!
It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
Why are you on to him?
It'l be alright.
It doesn't hurt.
It'l take months.
So we better get started.
Push it.
What? Forget it.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Shit...
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Good.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
You're exaggerating!
The New York Times ran a blow by blow of what we talked about behind closed doors! You fucked us!
Did you handle the round, Mr. Wigand?
What caliber is your gun?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
That computer has everything...
If this holds up, and it very well may not, Mike... but, if it did. And we aired this segment? And CBS was sued by Brown & Williamson? I think we could be at grave risk.
His "veracity" was good enough for the State of Mississippi.
Well, with tortious interference, I'm afraid... the greater the truth, the greater the damage.
Well, until you do, all I can tell you is what you already know... they will not air an interview.
Why?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
I'm going to the store. You need anything?
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Where should I wash them?
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Oh, someone took a poll? "Are all things Canadian boring...?"
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Yeah...
Area code 212-555-0199.
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
No shit.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way...
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
Lowell.
Did I get you up?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
Coffee?
Just so I know you know, when I talk to people in confidence, it stays that way.
Between journalists and management, yes, I believe they do... but I don't take that seriously.  Where do you work?
Should I just take the documents now?
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
They're afraid of you, aren't they?
Seven dwarfs?
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Yeah... Look, thanks for talking. I'm sorry I woke you up.
Lowell, I can't afford --
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
...I was young. I was young... confused... We didn't handle it the right way...
That's not the fucking point, whether you told the truth or not! Hello...?
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
Where are you, anyway?
I think I need to call the police. He won't respond...
Did he hear you?
I can't say that!
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
You heard Mr. Sandefur say before Congress that he believed nicotine was not addictive...?
A delivery device for nicotine. Put it in your mouth, light it up, and you're gonna get your fix...
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Jeffrey says exactly what's on his mind. Most people consider what they're saying... social skills... Jeffrey just charges right ahead.  Now, I know you understood the nature of the confidentiality portion of your severance agreement with Brown & Williamson, Jeff...
You threatening my family, now, too?
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
No!
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
What part?
Who do you want me to kill?
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
What the hell is Botox?
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Got any symptoms?
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
Yes?
Mrs. Guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
Except for two years when he was in the Navy, in Korea.
How nice.
Not yet.
But you don't agree?
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
Howard is a beautiful person.
We're damaged goods.
No, we're not!
Yes.
Good.  Are those foods?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Miles? You're scaring me.
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
Marylin!
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Murder!
She did a Harriman.
Do you know him?
Well what does he want?
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I'm sorry, Mr. Massey, but I felt certain you'd want to know -- Marylin Rexroth wants to see you.
And it's good!
I'm not sure.
Nothing?
I think that went as well as could be expected.
I am very sorry.
What the hell is wrong with you?
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just separated from his third. He's in fish. He is fish.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
Yeah.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Where are you taking me?
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
What've you got against King Westley?
Ellie
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
On the road.
Well, if it's as serious as all thatwe'll move heaven and earth to
I'd like to have a talk with him.
I'm sorry you read it.
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
What would you like to have me do?
What happened?
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Huh?
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
Oh, yeah?
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you  scram.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
My ticket?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came firstthen the tiethen the shirtnow, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you
Not as long as I'm alive.
I'm following you.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
No. But I've got a penknife. 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on
What happened?
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
Nope.
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
Comical part of it is, it isn't what you want at all. In a couple of weeks you'll be looking for the nearest exit . . .  People like you spend all your life on a merry-go-round. I guess that's what makes you so dizzy.  You're always chasing after something. At least you think you are. Truth is, you're just running away.  From yourself, mostly. 'Cause you're miserable. You hate yourself. The world's full of people like you. Don't know what they want.
No harm in your coming to see us.
Where's the bus to New York?
But can't you wait until morning
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
SorryI didn't mean to
I've been thinking about you.
Heyyou not up yet? Come oncome on!
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp.
Don't "Joe" me.
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollarsand I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
You're drunk.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Funny couple, ain't they?
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Collect?
Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Not a minute!
There's a seat over there for you.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
A gat! A gat!  Got any fireworks on you?
Whyno
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
Where do you live?
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Gee! That musta been terrible.  I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
What was his voice like?
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Did he pay you for this?
Go on, Willie.
Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.
And the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve.  We can't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
Those bastards!  That's proof enough right there of what we're up against. The whole goddamn Federal Government, Bill!
Found another note, same thing, no name, no signature.  "When you receive this, I will be quite dead, so no answer will be possible.  I offered you love.  All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth."
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
Why?
No, I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I've been shown.
Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our side.  I guarantee you the boss'll protect you...  Dave?
...give me protection?
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
Dave, I always play square.  No bugs. I'd love you to go on the record, but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're ready.
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
What was so appealing about Houston?
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Why?  What's wrong?
Leon's in a bad mood, don't get excited, he's all right.
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
Look, do you want the truth, or just what you want me to say?
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy Banister.  Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
I don't believe it!
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday night date you are.  Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
Honey, in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test.  Oswald was a radar operator.  He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Damn it, if I say I'll spend more time with him, I'll spend more time with him.  I can't fight you and the world too, Liz.
Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who would be running that training?
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief. I just need 10 more men and some more dollars.
No.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
Just speculating, I guess.  How do you think it started?
His name?
How much more?
Nobody knows what we're talking about, Jack.
She's the best damn witness we have!
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Yes, your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there.
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
Yes?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
I can't believe you do me this way.
You got a good lawyer?
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
Ordell pick up his bond?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
If you're having some.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
Are you?
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
You know some interesting people.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
When did you decide?
What do you do when he comes home?
It'll be more than that.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I didn't use you, Max.
I know.
Sure I can't twist your arm?
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you?
I'm recording this.
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
And splittin' with her?
She didn't say.
What? To put one of these in my pocket?
If I did, I'd have to give you one, wouldn't I? Or we could take what we want. No one knows how much there is except us, right?
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
What did you do after that?
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
This guy with Melanie, that was Louis Gara?
If it'll make you happy.
What about me?
Killian's.
He said he didn't know about it.
It looks good on you.
Do you got something for me?
And what was your answer?
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Baby, I didn't --
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Managers get ten percent.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
She saw you with Sheronda. So Simone goes to the dress department with her Robinson's/May bag.
Designer clothes.
Want a hit?
When did you get out of jail?
You okay?
Where were you?
Detroit.
With Ordell?
Who's arm is that?
And your point is?
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
Lemme have the bag.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
The moon -- I dunno
I'm talkin' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel.
Can I ask you about Melanie?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?
Yep.
'Cause she my fine little surfer gal. She can't do me no harm. Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows. You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you, she never understand a damn word.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
That's what I got to talk to you about. You see, Melanie was giving me a hard time --
Where you shot her.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
Tell me.
He's a big one. You two tight?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Livingston, huh?
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
House.
Hey, Max.
They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession.
Hear what?
Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure.
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
Was she?
You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out.
What's up with this shit.
You know who this is?
You know what the fuck I'm talkin' about. You talk to her?
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
Yes.
He leave town?
Where do you want to go?
I'm alive.
It's all been a dream.
Oh, terrific.
What does that mean, Frank? I don't get it. Why?
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
There was a bang.
It was the window.
Don't go.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I saw Sarah the other day.
What? She threw me out, remember. She wanted some professor to carry her far away from Brooklyn. Only we didn't make it. She can't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
What can I tell you, Louis? After Nam I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.
What? By myself?
What are you doing?
Jake, you need to rest.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
They stole it.
Where is the lamp?
Who? Jed?
They're weird names.
What?
Is that the one who died?
Where's Della? Bring her here?
It's gone to the top.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
Underneath all the bullshit, just love.
It might be for me.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
I promise.
What're you ... ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where are they?
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You can have anything you want.
Like it was yesterday.
If you knew, why didn't you say anything?
How do I know this isn't just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
I don't know what to say.
He's burning up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
You come near me and I'll blow us all up.
That's some gash. His guts keep spilling out.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
Paul Gruneger!
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.
I'm afraid to go by myself anymore. I keep thinkin' one of 'em's gonna come up behind me. Somethin's wrong when a guy can't even take a leak by himself. I've seen 'em take people right off the street. I used to go home a different way every night. Now I can't even go home.
He's not part of the program.
Minimal.
Blowing the walkway? You come up with that yourself?
Hurry!
Get them in the lab!
Ok Sarge, what's your status?
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
Kicker, anything?
Where are you going?
Rizzo?!
I thought you meant...
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work.
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Okay?!!
Close the fucking door!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
I'm gonna spew.
YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
What do we do?!!
Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
Robot huh?
Kay-em 14.
Who are you apologizing to?
Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door.
Leave him behind!
The power's back up!
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
Jason? He's on this ship?!
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Yes!
You got it.
It's my charter. My party.
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
You want to go through those?  I'm taking them to the Thrift Shop. It's Marcia Vaughn's pet charity. Pick out what you want to keep -- it's mostly your city clothes.
Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
I can't work in a vacuum. Why don't you make Hendricks Chief? His family's been here since the Puritans -- half this island are his cousins.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Who's that young man?
There's only one thing you're good for anymore -- signing a damn voucher. Here. It's an authorization to employ a contractor.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
What is all this stuff?
Depth-finder, fathometer, sonar, closed-circuit TV -- fore and aft -- RDF, single side band...  And two loose nuts behind the wheel.
Where'd you get all this?
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
We will. There's something I've got to find out.
Quint...?
I didn't know her.
No. Cambridge. Harvard. My family's in Tuxedo, New York, though.
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
It's only two-thirty. What, are you tired?
Look at him take it!
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
I saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... Mikey loved it. Made me promise to get him one. Will you live on the boat?
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
Hey, you! Farmer! Half-speed there...
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
You know how I feel about her.
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
We're getting a stretch limo.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
No...
You know it's okay.
Wizard!
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Yup.
What? I'm not made of stone.
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?
I'm a junior.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
You know, you've been acting like this ever since I went up to see my brother at Mankato. I told you, nothing happened!
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
Oh, is he bald and amorphous?
You know... it's parts...
We definitely want it to have junk.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
You know, not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this.
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
Is Vanessa here?
I actually know this one.
What's the matter?
Juno! Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know. It can feel pain. And it has fingernails.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Then what's going on?
Elbow.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Aha! You love him.
There are ads? For parents?
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
What?
What would be a good time for you?
What?
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
Carryin' a gun.
...That's not true.
Happy birthday Adele.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
You just smile, let me do all the talking.
...thank you.
What's wrong with her?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
This guy killed a mess of people.
How did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
Wait a minute. You're gonna hustle me?
You two been busy in here.
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
So how's it going?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California.  "We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
What did he sound like on the phone?
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Fuck!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Where's Adele?
Yes. Altogether.
With how many people?
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
That would be good. But I mean more like. I don't know. Like when I was having sex with her, I kept thinking how much I would like to put it in her ass. Just to see what would happen.
Did you tell her that you loved her?
You wanna go to Paul's house?
I'm sure he's got food. He's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Can you do it man?
But that's the thing. Girl's like it slow. They like romance. They like things to be sweet and romantic.
Yep.
I'm not joking. I wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. At that point and moment, Darcy was like a vision of perfection.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
Hey Jennie. Long time no see. What are you doing here?
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Sup then? Sup?
No. No, I'm serious. I'm not joking. I just like you. That's all.
What is it?
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
Come dance.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
How many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
I tested positive?
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
Yeah?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
Oh hi Jennie. Do you want to come make out with me?
I didn't bleed.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Yeah.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
You think so?
He still does.
Holy shit. That's all true?
But then I won't need your money.
It was... it was.
I can't man.
Then let's narrow it down.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
I was with him the whole time until I got the call at the hotel.
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
We'll find the evidence.
Why did you write remember on the wall?
Why her?
Why are you doing this?  You must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
I used a variation.  You should have anticipated that.  Have you figured out the message?
What word did you leave last night?
Interesting concept.  I hadn't thought of that.  If you think about how Anton Berger plays chess you might get it.
Yes?
The game's over.  You lost.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
Feeling better?
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
So, are you having a good time on the Island?
Congratulations, dad.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Anything?
Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
You didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
Well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  There's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
You opened with the English.  Lutz won't use it.  He opened his first game with it.
He knows you're aware of that.
Just thought you might want to talk.
No.
Bainbridge Books.
Could you please do me a big favor?  In the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  Could you look and tell me what they are?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
It is.
Another kind of game?
In a way.
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
You mean like in the steam room?
I know it was bad.
No.
Why?
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
What do you want on it?
Would you settle for pepperoni?
I thought you said the line was busy?
Peter, you have to admit--
I was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
Frank told me.
You beat him.
I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
Where is the Fortress?
Lyssa ...
In the Arctic ice.
They have Lyssa!
You will do as I tell you. You will try to reach Ynyr, the old one.
The White Castle has fallen.
Turold's son was to marry her.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
What do you see?
I'm not sure.
You are young. You don't understand the attraction of great power, and you forget the pain of long waiting.
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
No! You cannot know that!
You have done it?
Yes.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
You too are lonely.
I cannot betray my bride.
Not yet, my friend. It's your tomato that's dying.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
Fame.
You will follow me.
When did you last sleep, boy?
I'm not hungry.
Forgive me. It's childish to cry.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
We'll meet you at the inn.
Food for crows.
The one with red eyes was a Dark One, the other was a Cyclops, and it was not you he meant to kill.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
Freylag's stronghold?
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
I knew.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
You know the voice.
Each to his fate, lad.
No, she was not as beautiful.
You had a son.
It is no trickery.
No.
What's that man's name?
Why do you want to know?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Do you need money?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Well, I don't need them...
Wow! It's brilliant!
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
No.
Why?
Risky business, isn't it?
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
...No...
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Nothing, for the moment.
It will take them five minutes!  How long ago did they arrive?
You say it just to calm me!
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
I'm used to it.  Not everyone likes music.
Huh? Why?
...Who sent you?
Yeah... And still in Messina.  He's my uncle.
No...
What is it?
I've all ready gone six hundred miles... I can't do it again.
Are you two planning kids?
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
What?
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
Yes -- you are.
I know what you're getting at.
Yes?
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
It's a special day isn't it?
Anything?
Why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  Are you going to show it to someone?
It isn't going to make it Ellen. Let the poor thing go quietly.
Go to sleep Ellen.
Most certainly.
That's a reasonable assumption.
I'm Isaac... I'm three.
Right.  But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed... but not Big Billy.  He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  It came to the end of the game.  It was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
Phileas Fogg?
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.
We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
I do.
How are you feeling?
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Orange soda?
Hello!
I sometimes fade out.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
Sera...
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
Hi!
No?
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
I'm going to fill it right now.
When?
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
Can we just forget it?
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Where have you been?
That's right.
I have a 4.0.
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my husband lying on the floor, bent down to check his heart, screamed my head off and Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
What?
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
Miss Windham, can you tell us what you'd been doing earlier in the day?
What?
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
I feel so bad for her. I mean, she's in jail! And she's innocent. But I'm the only one who believes her. Donovan totally thinks she's guilty.
No. Sometimes I say "Okay" instead of "Fine".
The idiot speaks.
Too demure?
But isn't it kind of hard to get into law school?
It's Elle!  Guess what I'm doing right this second?
Neat.
And D) Brooke is obviously hiding something.
I can't believe you called me a butthead. No one's called me a butt- head since ninth grade.
Okay, how would it work?
I can't.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
No -- it's just -- not me.
I miss you guys! The people here are so vile! Hardly anyone even talks to me unless it's to say something that's not nice. Law school sucks!
It's pink.
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
You don't really believe she's innocent?
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
You're breaking up with me?!  I thought you were proposing.
Elle, believe me, I never expected to be doing this, but I think it's the right thing to do.
Harvard. Law school.
I'm sorry, I just hallucinated.
Fool's magic.
Then we smash 'em?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Always.
Birdies... pretty...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You go to lady now?
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I am a creature of darkness.  I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
Damn you!
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
From the parapets most likely.  The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
No, wait... please... listen...
Gump, is it?
Faerie ring?
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Big question that, lad.  Why what?
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you care about what's happened?
There must be an answer somewhere.
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
And if she thinks me a liar?
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
Fine-looking army.
We must follow that bird.
Beware.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats.  It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
It doesn't matter.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
What weapon?
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
We seek to undo the curse.
Look at that shot!  Three at once! I can't miss!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here.  Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
A promise is a sacred oath.
Stop complaining.
Not if you be chaste.  Tis an awesome test of virginity.
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
My lady mocks me.
Tis not fit for a princess.
What?
Sunlight... It destroys him.
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Nay.  Tempting as your invitation be.  Tell me one thing more.
Exceeding fair.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I'd be honored.
Only that?
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Heading north still?
The fastest in the world.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
Is he a friend, then?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
He hasn't called?
Do you guys feel like painting?
Mom?
I'm going to bed.
Atonement.
My keys.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
It's not what I was expecting.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.
Where to?
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
I can use your mom's.
Why are you so uptight?
It would help me if I could kiss you.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
And of course the Beck's, with the...
And if I enclosed it?
Maybe...?
Forty.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
Thank you.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  And there's no make-up at my house.  No glue sniffing.  Huffing. No pills, no grass.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Are you totally insane?!
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
I don't know.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  This is the end of it, Sam.  I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
That's not true.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
To hide a black eye.
I still don't know what that means.
You lied to me!
Oh.  Sorry.
He never answers.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
What?
Four days.  I left to think.
I need to talk to you.
Why would they tow your truck?
I love those doors.
The garage is plumbed.  I'll put in a toilet.  We'll survive.
Sounding?  I need help.  He's cheap labor.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
What?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Do you need help?
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
I'm married.
You bit my finger.
I need to know.
Left you?
It'll take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Where are the kids?
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
Can you stay for dinner?
Yeah.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
What did you say?
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
We played down in Jackson yesterday. Heard a rumor you've got a boy up here who can hit the ball a ton.
No, but...
Then what's the problem?
She's alright, isn't she?
I apologize, Claude. That was rude of me.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Claude, mind helping me to the bathroom?
Sure, boss.
I got it... boss.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
I know it begins with a "C"...
Sure I do. What's your name again?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
Start your job? What kind of job?
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
The Negro League don't pay so good. And you're always on the road. That don't wash with Daisy.
You gave up baseball to be a bank teller? I can't latch on to that.
My daddy is dead so watch your mouth. You can say what you want about me, but don't be dragging my daddy into it. This watch means the world to me. Solid gold. Keeps perfect time.
Oooh...
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Here I am.
Still got that ten dollars?
That jelly you were talking to right here?
She's in a tight spot. Her mama needs this operation, and they ain't got the money for it. Their church took up a collection but they were still short...
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?
So?
I kinda lost track of how many people we killed that night. Must have been 15 or twenty -- not counting women and children. It was a real bloodbath. All that screaming...
So?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
What am I gonna eat?
You want to hit?  Yo, Claude. Give Can't Get Right a shot.
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
Judge must have money riding on the championship.
Take that back or we ain't friends no more, Claude Banks.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
I can't eat this.
You didn't get ketchup?
Hell of a day for a ballgame, huh, Claude?
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
Can't I get one of those steaks you got grilling back there?
How about some steak sauce?
He's from New York City. That one, too.
Why do I get the feeling when you say some time, you mean some time.
1932? That's like, that's like...
Old man Wilkins' never came out of that bathroom. Died right there on the crapper.
Wait for the firemen!
I prefer bourbon.
What's going on here?
Are you offering me a bribe?
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
ADRIAN!
You shouldn't have come here.
He should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
Is this a joke?
Could you concentrate for five seconds?
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
All right. Let me out.
Valerie's crying!
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Did you just talk?
It's not me, moron.
So far, so good. Now what?
Everything's fine, pop.
Last time you said that the renaissance happened.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
I'm lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
Coulda been much worse.
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
You sure you're down with this?
Come on. One more time.
Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! Did you ever see THE UNTOUCHABLES?
Yes, great movie...
Please. You got to.
Hello.
It's "Comptoir Sud Pacific." Makes me feel like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I'm going for. Wanna come in?
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
No.
Yes...
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead.  Please tell me you like metal.
Don't do it.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
No.
That just hurt a lot.
From? From? From?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
You should've seen me take my last Runner... perfect.  I backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  So now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
I don't know what makes you so curious. You have any idea who his seed-mother was?
What's your name?
I'm Mary 2.
He was killed.
Jessica.
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
No.
And now?
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.
Not about that.
Maybe... sure...
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
What do you suppose this was...?
You knew that I wasn't before, didn't you?  Why did you stay with me?
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
What's that?
I doubt it.
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
That sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
We can't. We're going back.
I don't know.
But there may be a few around somewhere.
It isn't fair. I'll give you one of my favorite cats... a Jellicle cat.  "Jellicle cats have cheerful faces, Jellicle cats have bright black eyes; They like to practice their airs and graces And wait for the Jellicle Moon to rise."
Thank you.  Tell me -- what do those words mean? "Beloved husband"... "Beloved son"... "Beloved wife"...
Can you make it back?
Someone will follow. When you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. Jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Too little.
This rod is a fuckin', embarrassment, Carl. Whatiya burn in this thing, "V"?
What?
Very strange.
Do you own a video camera?
You recognize that guy?
I was here yesterday.
So what do we do?
Pornos.
Andy, who is that guy?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
You don't look so good.
I gotta headache... What's goin' on?
The police called us.
Have you made any charges against him?
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.
I wouldn't know how.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Something wrong?
What's bothering you, Madison?
Good book, huh?
When you didn't come to the club.
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
You're up early.
What was that?!!!
Okay... Lemme clear it with...
I can see that.
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
If you think you can finish it, I'll be back later today.
Hello.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
What night?
No... I told you.
I don't want to talk about it...
What do you want?
I don't know.
Where'd you come from?
I was?
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Oh, read it!
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Well, it looks to me as if we're traveling west.
Is it?
And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Just call me Barney.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
Say, what about that gold deal?
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
All right! If you insist on being an idiot, I'm not going to waste time coaxing you.  How about you?
You will need suitable clothes for the journey. It is not particularly far, but quite difficult.
It's three thousand feet, practically straight down to the floor of the valley. The Valley of the Blue Moon, as we call it. There are over two thousand people in the Valley besides those here in Shangri-La.
They were.
I see. Gold for ideas. You know Mr. Chang, there's something so simple and naive about all of this that I suspect there has been a shrewd, guiding intelligence somewhere. Whose idea was it? How did it all start?
You're startled?
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
I don't mean it in that sense. I only give credit where credit is due.  Er, Mr. Chang, I'm very anxious to have you realize that I never for a moment believed that ridiculous kidnapping story.
Why, no.
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
How can we get in touch with them?
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
The power house - they've blown it up! The planes can't land without lights.
See that spot?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
What's on your mind, Bob? You talk as though we're going to have trouble getting out of here.
Nothing about the porters yet?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
I don't need any proof.
Is that all my story meant to you?
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
I'm tired of owing you things. You're free to go. Go ahead.
I'd go mad!
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
Yes, the little Russian girl.
She was kidnapped and brought here two years ago just as we were, Bob.
I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
A man whose life was empty!
Bump?
Ouch!
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
You'll wait till you rot!
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
Hell of an assistant, isn't he?  Damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
All the time, sir.
You do?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
What?
The point is to not call attention to ourselves.
What?
Something's wrong here.
Gee.  You really think?
You think that's what's-happening?
Jesus Christ...
He's here to help!?
Since how long?
You were saying?
Not her. Me.    They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars. I never just look anymore and they're beautiful.
So, I guess you could say you're really into insects...
It's hard to find.  It's an old civil war cemetery.  Nobody ever goes there.  So... what is it you say you do?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Nowhere.
So... now what?  Cattle call again?
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Wally!
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
I'm so sorry... I just want him back... I want him back so bad...
That's comforting.
They were performance pieces.
Hey, you wanna know where the word came from, "glitch?"
Tell me not to worry, John.
Uh-huh...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
I wrote it down in your calendar, then left a message at your house --
Victims are pronounced here. Killers here.  We never touch anything.
Start a location run and a contact search for future victim Leo Crow.  And, Jad, I'll need a Last Known Sheet when you get it.
It was Iris Hineman.  She developed the Precogs, designed the system and pioneered the interface.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
She's a precog?
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
Who are you?
Six years ago.  Baltimore.  You grabbed a kid at Francis public pool in the West End.
Do you know who I am?
The precogs were wrong.
Who made you do this?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
You don't seem all that proud.
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way.  But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
The system would collapse.
You want to bring it down.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
Then how did he --
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
The guy from USA Today is here.
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.
Near Death's real popular right now, which includes everything from getting hit by a car, to falling off a high building to plane crashes.  It's a big rush, you come out the other side without a heart attack.
Uh, yeah, being concert master of the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra is one of our most popular choices...
No, I wanna kill my boss!
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I think you're swell company, Knott.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
You mean after he lost your son.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
Yeah.
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
What if I gave you forty?
It's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
He's great, right. Is he great?
He's alright.
What's wrong, baby?
You're not my daddy.
Chloe?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Goodbye, Bobby.
Your dance is over.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
So, when's the drop.
We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Ruiz tied in out there?
Where's Ricky?
Where's Ricky.
They were out of line --
Bobby, I love Jessica like she's my own daughter. I would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in Beverly Hills and wants I should buy him an implant. Your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
I don't understand.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
You told him you liked him.
There won't be a next thing.
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.
What's that?
Taken care of?
Yeah... Mmmm, that sounds good... Uhu...
We're supposed to meet him here. Is Ruiz on the list?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you.
Yeah. I know the number.
I thought you hate that club.
I think we might.
He implied it.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime. What are you? Nuts? You've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
I still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
It's not even yours.
Shhh...  Yeah, yeah... No. No. I'll be there.  You gotta get me to the Magic Castle at four.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
I'm not taking her to a bar.
Is that the woman from..?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Who you calling?
How much is it?
How much? Okay. Make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. Bye.
Great. On my fucking room.
How'd they know who you were?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
Back in.
We're getting whacked.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
Did you hear what he just said?
Whatever. We're here. We may as well go to the penguin house.
It's gonna be fine.
Where do you get this shit?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
Holy shit. Get me back to Manhattan.
I'll drop you off in a minute. I want to see if the baby's up. You wanna come in?
Tom. How's it going?
Watch out, man. Sorry. I'm on the list, man.  Hey, bro.
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. You gotta go and say all that 'Red Dragon' shit. Make him think he's on Barretta.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Sorry about that. Where's your mate?
Is it nice?
Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
Sure. You boys want anything?
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-A battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to JFK.
Keys.
What?
So tell me how it is.
Yes, sir.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
Shut it, man. Shut it. Tom is a square. He don't but dabble in shit. Maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an Austrian passbook account.
Mmmm-hmm. Where's the, uh, 'Dragon's lair?' Where do you live?
I'll get it.
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
Sombitch and I ain't never been to Beantown.
Man's rep travels.
Is your papa West Indian?
Did you just now con me?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
I'll give you back the 600.
That's what it is. Walk on out.
Yeah, got to do something about you.
Who the hell are you?
Talk, daddy, I'm listening. Hey that ain't bad. You got some more?
Why? Why does everybody conk?
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I will do it.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
No, Brother Minister.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about you for a change.
There's nothing to talk about.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
Just an idle question.
Are you?
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
Yes. Did you eat?
It won't be easy.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
Bembry saved my Life. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad saved my life.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I'm tired of praying.
Brother Minister, what is wrong?
Do you know what a friend you have in Jesus, son?
They were Hebrew, weren't they?
Please, go ahead.
Mr. Malcolm X, why do you teach black supremacy? Why do you teach hate?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Sweetie, they're almost ready.
I didn't know then that I was a nigger.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
[Where are you coming from?]
It's Santa Muerte. Death worship. The religion of La Hermanidad. There's a curse on you.
So what do I get in return?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[She's late, Mr. Creasy.]
[The bible says, "Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[I don't know! We work in parts. A voice calls in a kidnapping. We deliver the target to the guardians. We don't even know them. They might transfer to other guardians. The negotiators and the bosses don't even see the target. They just make the deal!]
[He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. He is part of the Brotherhood.]
[What do you mean?]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
How does it affect you?
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
Nothing wrong.
But don't you stay in El Paso?
You did something on impulse?
Well, you'd have to keep it under control.
Samuel Ramos. Owns one of the plants in Juarez. The Jap car industry is in the toilet. He's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him. I think he's in trouble. He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
You're fast.
It hurts.
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?
No.
I dropped her at home.
Could I ask you a question?
Don't be a baby. You're tougher than that.
Continue to play in the wrong key, like you're dyslexic.
You're American.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Sorry.
I don't believe you.
Los Arcos. Was a little girl kidnapped recently? About twelve maybe?
Last night. Do you know something?
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
You should be sleeping, baby.
Yes, mom?
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
She likes him.
[A bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. The bodyguard's American. Not only that he's black.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[You only fuck me to get information.]
[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
What for?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Oh.
You told me.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
Oh, I'm fine.
Marty...
Please...
I'll wait for your call.
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'm just here with another girl.
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Sure. This girl said...
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
So I'll die without a son.
You not ugly.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Hey, Ang'...
So, Marty, let me tell you about these nurses...
Hello, Ralph.
That's the big tall one, the fellow with the moustache.
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
Because I called up Tommy's brother Joe, and I said, "Joe, she's driving me crazy. Why don't you take her for a couple of years?" And he said, "Oh no!" I know I sound like a terrible woman...
Tommy...
You're welcome to one of these, whatever they are.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
Never this close.
Where?
Miss you, Walt.
Y'all mind the store.
Hey, you been sneaking some reading outside the frigging Bible!
What do you think of that piece of scenery, Yankee boy?
Little light reading matter. Just right for his age.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
What's that?
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Sixteen times.
Not without lots of praying and kissing the dice.  It's a different ritual but it works the same.
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Don't try to get it far down. Kick it up high so we can get there and surround that son-ofa-bitch.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Hell, man, that don't matter. We're loaded. We were big wheels in the black market in Seoul.
We're a good team.
Ravenous. What about you?
It's that disrespect for you, that's what I can't forgive them.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
...But I turned in my knee pads.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
I don't feel anything.
He only lasted one season.
So what makes you think he'll play for us?
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
And his track record, that don't count? Look, honey, when you watch the two shifts try to notice which one does the most work with the least fuss.
I've noticed that both nurses and enlisted men address you as 'Hawkeye.'
Well, for college players that have been out of training seven or eight years...
Oh, no. We have dull stretches every week or so, thank God, when there's nothing to do after midnight.
You're an attractive man.
Something else we have in common.
Then why not, as long as it wouldn't hurt anybody...?
You're leaving tomorrow?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
At first is no doubt. But then I am seeing on his paper he work in American hospital. And I think there are so many drugs in such a places, he could take some by mistake.
What do you want with those two medical officers?
Thanks.
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
Good morning, Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest.
And if I go to New York, the natives there will carry me? I don't think so.
I'm Colonel Blake. You fellows just passing through?
What's going on? Who started this?
What's wrong with you?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
One of the surgeons from the day shift will have to stay on duty tonight?
Morning, Radar. How were things?
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Those two big guys were tackles on the Cleveland Browns, and the redhead played halfback with the Rams.
Nice.
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off!
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
John Doe, the one in the speech.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Did you write this?
Oh!
Tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, John Doe will announce the formation of a third party.
Hello?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
There is no letter.
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterdayhere he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
Where's Connell?
What?
Both of 'em?
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Who's got him?
You don't have toWhy, we're with you, Mr. Doe. We just lost our heads and acted like a mob. Why, we . . .
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
Join the John Doe Club.
Sure.
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
I think maybe you'd better. And ConnellI'd like to have the John Doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter Miss Mitchell wrote, for which I gave her a thousand dollars.
How about family? Got any family?
No.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine!  So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh?  You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
Yes! I was paid! But the
What difference does that make?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
It's good to see you. Sit down.
It's for Ann . . .
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Did you want to see her about something important?
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
Spencer of the Chronicle .
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
You worried about me, too? The chief's worried about me. Solis is worried about me. Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
No shit! He's good!
This cousin of yours... What's his name?
You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
Are you going to turn on me too? Who helped you when you were strung out? Who gave you money? Who bailed you out of jail?
Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Tell my dad I'm sorry about the watch.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
Automatic.
What do you got on Korda?
Satisfied?
Yeah.
With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. Why here?
You don't like New York?
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
I can't do that.
You know the ten commandments?
We need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
You worship yourself.
Scottie...
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
I can't do that.
Are these yours?
What do you need?
System's running on auxiliary.  Only seven hours before it crashes.
That's a strange question.  You a strange man?
This is how you pick up women --
No.
You sealed off the system.  When it crashes, everyone dies with you.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Only up there in the dream they called life.
Where the hell are you going?
You sure he's going to come?
But what if he doesn't --
What about the customers with reservations?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then where is she?
Where?
Then how do you know about --
That's not possible.  No one can do that.
Don't know what you're talking about.
Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late.
What?!
So how can we get to it?
SYSTEM MALFUNCTION!
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove.
It is said that to those who possess the Power... all things are possible.
It is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
What's a Triac?
... Not bad.
No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
Anybody see them?
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
One fuckin' year ago I had ta hit you up for train fare. Now I can buy the fuckin' train. And I ain't even a fuckin' Sicilian!
Poor, yeah.
Boo-Boo.
Up here, Boss.
You scare me, Charlie.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Four-twenty-eight.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
You got men on Profaci's place?
How's Bugsy doin'?
Where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
I'm sorry, but I sleep better when I know I'm with the winning side.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
So you all make the same mistakes?
If I look weak now, it's over.
I'm very sorry... I didn't...
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
I been thinkin'...
Tommy Reina's gone over to Maranzano, but so far Masseria ain't lifted a finger,
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
I know. When the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
This business is about taking risks.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
I'm still the Boss of All the Bosses! And you'll do what I say!
But that's an hour's drive.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
What about the share.
I got partners.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Spare us.
Where's the stiff?
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
What?
What's the maximum safe dose?
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without him.
At the moment, yes.
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> This is an <u>honor</u>. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. You da <u>shits</u>!!
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's <u>one thing</u> you might try. Only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
I'm so dumb! I <u>deserve</u> to die -
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
So, what do you think?
How are you doing sweetheart?
What pictures?
Mother, I ...
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around.
Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling.
I love you, Mom.  I have to run.  You remembered to call the limousine service, right?
Mm hmm.
Give you something to shoot at, Senator--if you figure on doing any talking.
Thanks very much, sonny--
Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger button.
You've never *seen* this contract.
You are saying, in effect, that this is a forgery?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
And while you're at it, get me a bed!
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay!  Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's *lost*!
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
What's this, Diz?
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no use combing my hair for nothing.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
Well--I stuck my foot in it again at the President's press conference today--  How come so early? Get the day off?
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long shot--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
*I'm* just waiting for a street car--
Yeah.
Tonight?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Huh?
He's cooked! They'll drum the poor lug out of that chamber tomorrow as sure as I'm--! And now they're all down on him. Yeah--my press pals, too--he's a bad egg--still water running deep. Boloney! It's the frame of all time! When I see a phoney like this--my journalist blood boils-- I wanna *fight*!  Look, kid--rack your brains, will you? Haven't you got any confidential stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm off--I'll blow Taylor and his--
Why me?
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house!  Hubert!
Taylor, my dear.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Otis!
Are you ready for him, Bill?
Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting for you--
Happy, we've got the man. Horace Miller!
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Yes! He's about to blow the whole machine to smithereens--and *you with it*, Mr. Governor!
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--
Well--yes--I was saying--the State should reward you--
Well--it started with a little mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown out of all sense and reason--
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Look! There it is!
He's a newspaper publisher I know-- and--
Mr. President!
For a question!
Shot in the back. I was there. I can see him at that old roll top desk, still with his hat on... still with his hat on...
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
--I may not know much about a lot of things, sir--but I know that Willet Creek country like a book--and--and I tell you, Senator Paine--there's something *wrong* about this dam-- why, there isn't a foot of water in that creek--it's dry four months out of the--
Well. I hear you've been right on your toes since you got here. Pitching right in. Lots of people took you for dumb--but they're wrong. You're smart. In fact, *I* think you're smart enough to understand a situation when it's explained to you--
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
What's your name?
Did you say--bus?
Most natural thing in the world!
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Committee.
Why?
The Steering Committee.
No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've done awfully well--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Terrible, thank you.
Why?
It *is* not!
No! Stop it!
Not another bill?
I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Well, I guess it's a chance.
I don't care *what* you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
Ah! That's more like it! What?
A camp! Well!
I'm splendid, too.
"--We hold these truths to be self- evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights--"  Well--looks like the night shift's comin' on.
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
Joe! You *told* him to!
--amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Hey--I wanna *scoop*!
Yeah?  And what else?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
All right--*yes*! And what does that make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
That'd be a crime--after all this work--getting it buried in this Deficiency Bill as nice as you please-- approved--all ready to roll--
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim!
You can't say *that* to--
Maybe he won't get up.
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.
Thank you very much.
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
Are these the articles?
Were you present when all these things took place?
And you saw them happen?
You fainted.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Uh-huh.
I'm crucifying him.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
You're acting like a school girl.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
Can I have a month's vacation?
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
With pay!  She is out the door.
Last night he proposed to me.
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific!  "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That"
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
Your Honor, I object.
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
How do you do.
Will you have a cigar?
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
Why not? Who is he?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds.  Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Have a drink?
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
Now, where were we?
Why not?
Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. Very interesting.
Ja.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
Here's the order for the plows. We got a good price on them.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up $180,000.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
No, I mean - about my client.
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Yes. Have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
Your Honor
Uh-huh.
Oh, the poet? Where?
That ought to be fun.
No, he's too fussy for that. That's what's the matter with him. There are lots of nice girls right here in Mandrake Falls who're dying to be married
Don't pay any attention to her.
What is your name?
South Dakota north.
Yeah. What?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.[10]
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
But she's on the telephone
Hey, did you hear that?
Really? You think so?
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Take your time.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
But you do therapy?
What are you doing for lunch?
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
What kind of doubts?
What's that?
I have eighteen more minutes!
Where's your wife, Henry?
What is it?
I've had my moments.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
Tastes good.
I'd better get in there.
You do?
You know who that is, don't you?  You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
How ya doin', Ainge? Evenin', Lily.
Lily.
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
What it might take is... doing time.
Hello, Lionel.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
I'm trying.
What'd you want?
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
Wow. You're something.
Just who is here, can you tell me?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
No one ever thought so. You must bring it out.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Of course.
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
I am irate!
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
You got off easy.
In maybe three or four issues.
It's called pro bono.
Fuck the community.  There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Uh-huh.
What'd he say?
I understand.
Good-looking woman.
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Damn! What is your name?
But there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- Investigator.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
They are evil, cursed, they matter not.
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.
Let's make us even, shall we?
O'Connell! I am going to kill you for this!
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I got all the horses!
Don't gimme that, you never had any scruples.
What is he doing here?
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
You will not believe it.
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
The sun turning black.
The hell with that! I'm not goin' nowhere! We're safe here.
Yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.
A bright good morning to all.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?
You know your history.
No... Why?... Should I?
That bad huh?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather than later, before you ruin my career the way you've ruined yours.
I was mistaken.
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
We gotta get her back.
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
And what's that?
Where are you going?
And then one day, he didn't come home. The police said it was an accident. But cargo containers don't just fall on people. He was murdered... After that I fell apart. I dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. When my mother died I hit bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and I knew what I had to do.
So who killed him?
How's your dad?
Are you with me... or against me?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
You're dead.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Then why are you here?
You're a spy.
Alone tonight?
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
It is?
I wouldn't mind being famous.
And what if you get killed?
Bye. 
So how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
So what else has Superman got?
This place is built like a fortress.
Your Spiderman Pez dispenser! 
Cover me!
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
Are you famous?
Definitely.
This is bad.
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
What do you mean?
Are you serious?
Where are they?
Well, I believe there are at least 30 guns at Sablons.
The numbers are not particularly relevant.  You are not up against soldiers -- this is a mob, and they will run as soon as things become sufficiently unpleasant.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
Who is there?
She was sitting there... and it was as if I had last seen her only the night before... She hadn't changed -- she was still the same -- still completely devoted to me... and she told me we were going to see each other again and, never again, leave each other... She has promised me. Did you see her?
Excuse me, General Bonaparte, but I believe this is an extremely urgent matter, requiring your immediate attention.
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Oh -- where do you come from?
Bastia -- and you?
Ah-hh, no.
Why didn't you wake me then?
Good heavens, Ambassador -- what has happened?
Shall we move closer to the fire?
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Well, one must do something to live, you know -- and I have an elderly mother who depends on me.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
Not even the slightest hint of something?
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
Will you use the troops?
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
Ah, that is good.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
May I offer you a drink?
No.
No.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
I didn't mean the things that I said... I was angry and I said more than I meant to.
What the hell is the matter with you?
You wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
Article 46, calls for the virtual dismemberment of Prussia, reducing her population by half and her army to a token force.
That is correct.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
And I can go free?
Send Betty my love.  Boy you looking good.  I'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  I got something to show you.
Yeah.
You paid cash?
Y'all never use it?
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Where's that boy that told me Day-Day was here?
I don't know... I think he went out the back.
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Why?
How can they do this?
What's the matter?
How you know?  It could be anything.
What's the B-G's?
You make it sound so easy.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Easier said than done.  We saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
You coming in?
Hold up, Elroy, that's my boy.  Craig, what the hell wrong with you?  Where you been?
You too.
Smokin' what?
Are they still out there?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
I gotta think of a plan to get this money before tomorrow.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Why would he take it?  He don't even know you.
William.
You too big.
Need to lose some weight.
Mr. Nasty time.  But take it easy on me, girl.
What happened here?
Business or pleasure?
'S okay. What do you think?
She ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
I remember you...in the elevator.
You were very nervous.
Who did?
What?
This? I've never even fired one.
For what?
Come with us, sir.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
Are you 'fucking with me!?
What...?
I killed you.
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
Is that something precious?
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
On TV.
Keep it.
Please...
Irene is going to help.
Just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. Only cost you a dollar.
I don't want my windshield cleaned.
You're a big girl, huh?
I've got something for you.
It's under control.
Where is he? Did you lose him?
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
That's enough.
Yeah.
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You understand?
Can't hear ye, boy.  ...So the big boats heave a sigh, They blow for Uncle Birdie...
Uncle Birdie!
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Bluebeard!
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
You swore, Pearl!
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
Now listen to me, Pearl. You and me is runnin' off tonight.
John, where are we g --
Story, honey? Why, what story?
Huh?
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
What's your name?
All right.
Do you want more children, Willa?
Them kids is yours?
What you been up to?
Pearl and John.
How long's this been going on?
It's just a stupid cat.
Sometimes I wish you didn't live right across the street.
Slept like a rock.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Just want to talk to him a second.
Nan, I --
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
No.
Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Thank you, Comrade, thank you.
What are you serving?
About what?
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
What do you wear in the morning?
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
You wouldn't like Razinin.
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Capitalistic methods...
Misha! Misha!
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Good morning, Your Highness.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
If you will forgive me, ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I've noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
No, sir.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
No, sir.
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
A week?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
...and Kopalski.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Yes!
You're going to force us... huh?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
How long does it take a man to land?
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
You repeat yourself.
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
It's false sentimentality.
Let's forget that we ever met.
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
As a representative of Moscow...
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
Then how did you get here?
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Why?
At what?
Because we are an odd couple.
No.
You remember this room?
Ninotchka, I love you.
A funny story?
All right, we'll make it red.
Much happier.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Huh?
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
Hello.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
At Pre Mathieu's.
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Sir, if I may ... echo my concern ...
Where the hell is he?
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
Well, he certainly isn't acting like it.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
We could get that.
I'm still not confident we can ride through this.  Some people are going to have to go to jail.  Hunt's not the only problem.  Haldeman let me use the $350,000 cash fund in his safe to make the payments.  Ehrlichman had a role, a big role, in the Ellsberg break-in. And I'm ... uh, I think it's time we begin to think in terms of cutting our losses.
You say, John, cut our losses and all the rest.  But suppose the thing blows and they indict Bob and the others. Jesus, you'd never recover from that, John.  It's better to fight it out instead, and not let people testify ...
No, we have nothing to hide.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?
I figured that out.
Dick Nixon saying "I'm sorry"? That'll be the day.  The whole suit of armor'd fall off.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Mitchell?
I like it.  I like the idea.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
This is not a joke, John!
This is June twentieth?
There's no secrets here, Al.
Exactly!  We've got to take the war to them.  Hit 'em where it hurts -- right in the nuts.  More assassinations, more killings.  Right, Al?
... you mentioned the "Bay of Pigs" several times.  Sooner or later they're going to want to know what that means.  They're going to want to know what was on that gap ...
It came over from Vietnam, you know.
They did what?!  I don't understand. Why'd they go into O'Brien's office in the first place?
We feel the bigger concern is Gordon Liddy ...
Well, you know, sir, he's a nut.  He used to work here with the "Plumbers" and now he's running this Watergate caper.  You remember his plan to firebomb the Brookings using Cubans as firemen?  He wanted to buy a damned fire truck!  Magruder thinks he's just nutty enough to go off the reservation.
What's Liddy got?
All right.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
What?  That he knew Johnny Roselli? Hoover knew a lot of gangsters.
Jesus!
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
Money.  Follow the money.
Don't forget the South, sir, the West. Filled with the good football colleges, straight kids.  There's more of 'em with you than against you.  Not like these mudmutts.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
I believe you're right, boss.
Sir?
Right.  They don't trust!  They don't trust America!
So am I.  Thy father will have to know of thy lying.
What'd you say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
Diem?  Trujillo?  Lumumba?  Guatemala? Cuba? ... It's a shame you didn't take similar precautions, Dick.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
By offering Cuba to the Russians as a consolation prize?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
I want to see him tomorrow, Clyde.
Ummm...
How about you?  Are you going to win?
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
I never met the man.
Remember what Lenin said in 1917, Mr. President: "The power was lying in the streets just waiting for someone to pick it up."  The Communists have never been closer.  Now is the time to go back to the old themes, the ones that made you president.  Let the Communists know you're onto them.
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Mr. President, we are in a revolutionary situation.  We are under siege -- Black Panthers, Weathermen; The State Department under Rogers is leaking like a sieve.  And now this insignificant little shit Ellsberg publishing all the diplomatic secrets of this country will destroy our ability to conduct foreign policy.
No, Henry.  I don't.
... as the old alliances crumble.
This will get me a second term.  Damn it, without risk, there's no heroism. There's no history.  I, Nixon, was born to do this.
Yes, you always had a good sense of timing, Henry.  When to give and when to take. How do you think Mao, Brezhnev will react?  Do you think this is how they'll remember me, Henry, after all the great things you and I did together? As some kind of ... of ... crooks?
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?
Yes, Mr. President.
We let you down, didn't we.  Your people.
Mr. Chairman, there is an old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
So ... how's the food over there in China, Mr. Nixon?
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
Well, he seems to have bought Kissinger.
Jesus Christ!
You all right?
It wasn't your fault.  The soldiers were just kids, too.  They panicked.
It broke my heart when Harold died.
... give me a break, Mary.
... Use his women.
Syracuse.
Ernie Davis.
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Proud?
And this?!  Good Lord, have you lost your mind?  Nixon can't say this. "Niggers"!
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
Yes ... you know it!  Yes ... I will. Yeah!
Then I'll be there for you.
Are you okay?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick?  Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys?  You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Not for the Pentagon it isn't.  I'm kissing Mao's ass.  And the press is gonna find some way to shaft Nixon on this one.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I'm the only left, Dick.  If you don't talk to me, you ...
Thank you.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
Well what would you call him.
Who's he in trouble with then?
...You ride Winston.
Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
That's possible.
So when was he here?
What was the bullet?
You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
Yes sir.
Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Okay.
You gonna drive out there?
I can't plan your day.
I mean, would you care to join me.
Well they always is to the party concerned.
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
No.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
Llewelyn.
What're you doin', baby?
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
You are comin back, ain't ya?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Did you go up to his trailer?
Huh? What is...
Not a bleep.
Well -- where ya goin'?
...You need to talk to me.
Why would I care where you're going.
You know she won't be there.
Yes.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Call it.
Well -- we need to know what it is we're callin' for here.
No.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Somethin' like that.
One room, one night.
Yes?
Another additional.
Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
It wasn't a woman.
Junior year!
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
Any idea where it is?
No, I was just... How you doing?
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify?  Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
No... what about your sister?
What?
Maroon.  I stole it.
You knew Del?!
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life...  I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
Thanks...
So, call me when you --
What?
...well, then you ain't got much.
I came for love...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Dr. David Ravell.
You're hurting him!!
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Who?
Does he know you think he's real?
Rosa...
Where are you going?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Really. And where was that, old man?
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
That's right.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Like... us?
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us.  ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
How'd they describe her?
We should go.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
It just didn't fit her profile...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
...yeah, I got it.  Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
I see.  May I?
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
I'll think about it.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
What the hell's going on?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.
Uh-huh.
And she always had such spirit! But, after her mother died...
Would you say she was ambitious?
Yeah. Why, you know him?
David Ravell.
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
You lie, motherfucker...
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
Mr. Campbell?
Huh?
I flatter myself that such is the case; in my line of work it's plumb necessary. The one thing you don't want is air in the conversation.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
...Pete?
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
Well that's it boys, I been redeemed! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions. It's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting's my reward!
I just don't think it's right, keepin' him under wraps like we's ashamed of him.
Pete have a brother?
'N turned into a frog -
A miracle! It was a miracle!
What's his name again?
Gonna paddle ah little bee-hind.
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
YOU LOUSY YELLA-BELLIED LOW-DOWN SKUNKS-
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Who was fixing to betray us!
An' all my meals for free...
We prayed to God and he pitied us!
That's a maiden name.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful?  You should've called!
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Why?
Who gave you this idea?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who's that?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
Yes, sir!
It's important, sir!
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
No, sir!
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Louder!
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Yes I do!
He was. He died.
Something tells me you've been here before.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
I'm a little late, that's all.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
Sid, there's no baby.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
You got a girl?
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
God.
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
That's brilliant.
Hey, man, is the piss-ass money you're making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
But she expects you to marry her?
Sid, what happened?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
Remember that.
This is ridiculous...
I can't just...
She's gonna handle it.
Fuck.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
Cell phone.
Your husband says you said "There are three..." right before you got cut off.
Stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
Could the child please stop that?
Oh, I've seen these...
How many more do we have after this?
That room!
Yeah.
Call Dad!
Uh uh.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
Little Bobby... Just a kid...
Oh shit Alma... you're...
Huey!! Man you gotta check this out... You're gonna love...
Hold up a second... We got a decision to make.
Inspector Brimmer, this is no joke During your surveillance have you seen any outside agitators? Professorial types? Communists?
God damn... Kid never had a chance...
Aaaah, Bitter Motherfucker... I almost forgot how nasty that shit is.
Ain't gonna happen, stay cool.
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
Have to pass on the revolution today man, I got class... But how about tonight, I was gonna check out "Cloud Nine." Just like old times.
No, Panther Headquarters.  Least that way we could hang out more like we used to.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Can you make a deal with them?
Trust me Huey, this picture will be worth a thousand words. Now have you given any thought to that Peace and Freedom Party thing. They really want to hook up with us. Do a rally together. Hell it'd broaden our base of visibility.
That's right brother... listen and learn.
We need money first...
This here's a "Panther Patrol." We see a brother getting busted. We check it out, make sure the pig don't go beating on the man. Brother gets taken downtown, we post bail, hook 'em up with a lawyer.
Alright, I'll stay. Judge, I want to...
That's right. We'd be proud to provide as escort for Malcolm's widow. How many men you got?
No thank you sister.  Six?!! That seems a little light. Cops are watching Betty, watching her hard. We need at least twenty men. And that's twenty armed Panthers dig? You do have guns don't you?
Yeah.
Yeah... You were a lot of help with those guns. Your soldier shit is bad- ass.
See, the thing about Panthers. For all their speed and strength. They are not naturally aggressive. They don't just go out killing, tearing through the jungles murdering. No, the Panther  keeps his claws hidden until he is attacked, until he's backed into a corner. Then  believe me those claws are fierce.
I saw... but...
Don't let the cops provoke you. We're there to watch and take badge numbers...
What are you saying?
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
Do you think Frances with an "e" is too manly a name for a girl?
Do you think Francis with an "i" is too womanly a name for a boy?
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
It worked.  How many men can you raise?
Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
I should have known... once I would have... I used to be wary... and today I watched my son killed before my eyes... your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her...
We did.
Let us.  Unless you object, I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and, as such, there are certain customary practices. Perhaps I could explain them to you...
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Father?
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.
Please.
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
Name five hundred.
Royal petition, delegates to court, judicial redress, economic boycott, bribery...
We saw.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
They're nothing but farmers and you're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard.  They'd be better off letting it move on.
Don't touch him.
It is ended.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
But what about Thomas?
I was sorry to hear about your son.
Father, you can't let them take him...
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Lovey...Church might be still alive when you're in a high school...and that's a very long time.
Good God! Where'd you hear that?
Yeah, I know...how are things out there in Chicagoland?
But don't you dare say that.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I don't get it.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
God, that's fine.
Allman Brothers.
What do you mean?
Is there quicksand?
You keep saying that.
Yes.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
I told you last night--this can be the start of patching things up with your folks. If something good doesn't come of Gage's death, I think I'll go crazy.
How does he do that?
Elizabeth goes free!
That's right.
You see, I've got this honest streak in me -- in its own way, a sort of curse.  Oh, and there's the fact that you have no choice.
You're setting me up for a double cross, you with the ship, and me with nothing more than your word!
What -- you don't have the medallion?
There's ... another exit?
So what now, Jack Sparrow?  Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgement Day?
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
You've got sand, for a maid.
I can't breathe.
Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my proposal.
Elizabeth? Is everything all right? Are you decent?
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Miss Swann.
You're in league with Barbossa!
But ... you did it before!  Last time --
Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again.
To freedom.
Why?
Say again?
How do we expect to find an island no one can find -- with a compass that doesn't work?
Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
We're going to steal a ship?  That ship?
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Is that so?
No.  She hasn't.
Speak.
You can't mean that.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
It's ready now, I know it is.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
I promise, my dear, I will give the matter some consideration.
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
Hey!
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
You better quit pushing me, pal.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Aaabout...?
What did he want?
Yes?
It's Sim.  We're almost there.
He's probably right, sir, the building is probably going to collapse under its own weight.
When did you...?
The big house.
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think.  It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.  It's really wonderful.
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
Mouse?  What mouse?
You don't know?
We don't have time for hysterics.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.
Argon's private lab.
This is wonderfully accommodating of you all.  Now I won't have to come looking for you.
Yeah, and what might that be?
Maybe you're ready to find out if that hide of yours is bulletproof?
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
I think I better go, Stew.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and  
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
I see.
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
That's an excellent idea.
You're the Tribune man?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Look, I quit!
Right - for the first time this year.
It has been alleged - yes
Not on my own beat, no.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Why not?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey  Let me know when you're quitting.
No?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
The boss is getting hoarse.
Well!
Ah! Thank you, Joe.  Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
My error.
There you are!
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
What could I be?
You could be something.  I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Sorry, boss
Who was that?
You quit trying to stop anybody
Smythe, you've been drinking.
Stop calling me Mother!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Now, now Jeeves.[5] Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Yes sir.
A bird in a gilded cage?
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
... Sex.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
It's okay. It's alright.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I'm sorry ...
What?
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
Like a drum.
Sure you are.
What's all the commotion? Where's the cat?
Oh yeah.
Oh, gosh no.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
What?
Mary Sue--C'mon ...
What are you doing?
I'm busy.
Oh God! Are we in that episode?
She won't go out with me?
C'mon. Everyone's turning colors. Kids are making out in the street. No one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... Pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
I'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  You know what I mean by "changes"?
No. What?
No. Of course not.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
What happened?
The basketball team?
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!
Dan! Arrest them!
Look it doesn't matter. It's not important.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Yeah. Every episode ever.
Oh my God.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
No way.
I could like kill a guy with these things.
They don't notice that kind of thing.
What did you do to him?
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
You have no right to do this.
They're happy like this.
What?
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Keeps going ...
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Can I open it?
Right. And how did she dress him?
McGinty's.
Say--why don't you take this remote instead. It's got a little more "Ooomph" in it.
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Weil wouldn't you! You look for someone for years ... You pour your heart into it ... This is a privilege you know.  I don't think I better talk about this right now.
Look--it just sort of "happened" ...
It was a gift Bud. It was so special. You liked these things as much as I did, remember: Warm smells in the family kitchen? A smile from a stranger? You know how rare that is?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
I'm so glad you're here.
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Wow ... That's pretty good ...
Aren't you a little early?
Oh my Gosh, Bud ...
Saw you at the mall yesterday.
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
That's your fault not mine.
...please, I just don't want it....
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
I feel really on the spot now.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No.
Yeah? So what are you doing, then?
...yeah....well you have me now.
I just wanted to call and talk to you, thank you for last night, try and get you before you went to work and say, "hey."
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Why did you tell me you did, then?
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....
I don't know.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
I saw a picture of you.
What do you do with all this pudding?
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Sure.
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
No I didn't say that.
What happened?
I don't know.
That was good.
Yeah.
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
For work.....
I'm sorry.
Did you have my home phone number?
Ok.
Well who did?
I don't know.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
What do you mean?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
How many sisters do you have?
What's up?
Yeah.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Yes. Sorry.
Are you going to the party tonight?
I'll see you there.
That's it.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Ok.
Should I call you later?
He's a writer, not a madman.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
They've got no right, sending someone to sit on your shoulder. I work for you; I won't take orders from a stranger.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
There I was taxed; it's true.
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
Who's to say I did not?
And he's never once attempted escape?
Well?
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
Yes?
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
You've come to lecture me?
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
I'd rather read, thank-you.
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Sure
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
There's nothing to explain
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You will not walk out on me
It's all you. It has the political campaigns and the mining fortune and the war with Pulitzer and the castle. And ... Marion.
Sir?
Sir, I-
This is the chance you've been waiting for, boy. Tell that son of a bitch just what you think of him!
That's right. A symphony of those: vaunted and valued tellers-of-truth. Those heroic minutemen standing sentry on our liberties--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
Nope.
Showing life
Magic
But with compassion and insight--
I don't wanna write about no spic.
The old man has his own way of doing things
Okay, boy wonder, what?
I know who we're going to get I The great American biography! A journey into the soul of the beast.
Yes.
Fuck you--
I am giving you the last chance you will ever have to be yourself again!
He'll destroy us.
The key -- the key -- the clue -- what does this man recall on his death bed? Okay, Mank, you're dying. What's the last image that comes to you? Right now.
The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
I want you back
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Christ.
You wrote the damn thing, Mank Aren't you going to fight for it?!
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Of course, of course. How can we be of service?
To do what?
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
You're bettin' on an inside straight this time. You'll never pull it off.
This is an abomination There's no music and--
The magazines are one thing -- but Hedda! Why did we have to let her come?!
Well it' s all you've got !
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Why don't you just have the guts to admit it
Yes!
I know where you're from. You guys look the same every place.
They wanna talk to you.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
Where you going at this hour?
You fuckin' worm, if you're going out, I'm going out.
J.R., glad you could make it.
Whadda you care?
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
No, I see her around the pool. I know her. I know her like that -- not like that.
You wasn't with her, were you?
I don't like all those other clowns around. That's all I know.
They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass! Those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! How else could this have happened?... What do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
Whadda I gotta do, Joey? I knocked him down. What did I do wrong? I don't understand.
Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
Stick out your hands, Jake.
Why didn't you tell me about it?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
When it comes to her, I don't trust nobody. I'm askin' you somethin'.
Was Vickie part of the deal with Tommy? Was my wife part of the deal? Tell me, was that it?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
Yeah, what?
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
All I did...
"Father of the Bride."
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
What?
Why don't you just call him up?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Sure, what else is new?
How's the weight? Ok?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
It don't look right.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
What time?
Jeff -- huh?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
Like what?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
So did you. Goodbye, Jeff.
I don't know what you mean.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
I'm not ready for marriage.
No.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
That's good news.
You mean leave the magazine?
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Phone number?
I thought only punks fought with knives.
Where can we meet?
We heard firing.  He get anybody? You alone?
How'd he get in?
No--
He's going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody arrested him!
You mind if I try?  You have to slam the door in my face?  I try to get to him--what happens?  Don't I give you everything you want?  A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer.  I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Will you wait a minute?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
He depended on me.
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
He's just loaded, honey.
See?  It stopped.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
No.  I don't think so--
You shouldn't monkey with him.
What's your name!
I just don't want trouble.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
Who's that!
What?
They like you.  Okay?
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
So then you moved?
They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Now that's true!
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Who lives?
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
A what?
You cold?
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
What's he like?
Oh, I don't know.  You have to get to know him.  He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  He's sincere.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Hi, Plato!
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
He wants... your "sister"...
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.
Toys for... adults?
We sell children's toys --
Radio said negative five.
I don't think it's negative five.
What.
No, c'mon --
I told you, Nick. Remember?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn.  A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
You need a COAT!
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff... I haven't gotten you anything --
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Nick, no --
Nick --
No, Nick, no --
So does it look a lot different?
What?
I'm going to have to be inside that casino. When it happens. I'll need to be part of it. I can't just be drawing some map.
Nick, what are you talking about?
I'm almost done.
Is there any way you could get into his truck?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I shared his cell!
She says a lot of things.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
I did.
Six men means six guns.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
You are lucky, convict. You're spending Christmas with the birthday boy himself --
Take 'em.
The tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
Fuckin' freezing.
You want that for here or to go?
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
No, I think that's just oranges. She writes here she's eating oranges.
Jesus, Rudy --
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money --
There is no other table --
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
That I should've picked you up?
You tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. But don't try to fuck me. I don't think of you that way. I mean, I like you a lot -
Yeah, Elois. E and Lois. We called her Lady E.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
We were trying to find out what he knew about the set up.
Yeah.
Yeah. They had just won the night before, and he made a killing off 'em.
Didja use the commode story?
I'm sorry.
Ain't that a sad truth. Remy Martin?
It's the least I could do Vic. I wish I coulda done more.  Vic. Toothpick Vic. Tell me a story? What're your plans?
Give me this fucking thing.
I'm sick of fuckin' hearin' it Joe; I'll give it back when we leave.
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.
Give me my book.
You gonna put it away?
No, she did it. She killed the cheatin' wife, too.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
He don't believe in it.
I know.
You do?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Oh excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine. Are you a doctor? Are you a doctor? Answer me please, are you a doctor?
I can' take you to a hospital.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
These ladies aren't starvin' to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
How the fuck do you think? The cops shot him.
As opposed to good?
Look, enough of this "Mr White" shit -
How can you be so sure?
I got 'em, all right?
Where? Are they out in the car?
No shit?
He will be dead fer sure, if we don't get him to a hospital.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Don't fuckin' patronize me.
Both of you two assholes knock it the fuck off and calm down!
Cut the bullshit, we ain't on a fuckin' playground!  I don't believe this shit, both of you got ten years on me, and I'm the only one actin like a professional. You guys act like a bunch of fuckin' niggers. You ever work a job with a bunch of niggers? They're just like you two, always fightin', always sayin' they're gonna kill one another.
You should be. Maybe Lednov heard about that Sonora ranch of yours.
Look of things, she doesn't.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
You can stay here if you like.
And this is Helen Carter.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
Yeah.
Hold on.
I suppose it is.
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Why?
I've got eleven horses.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
You'll live.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
I don't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
That sure smells good.
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
They shouldn't have done that.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
We got company. Female company.
Put on another one.
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Do I know you?
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
Cindy, what's going on?
No, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
Shhh... It's okay.
No, stay.
Oh, yeah. I'm just curious about that kind of stuff.
Then what kinda stuff can we do?
We should act out our inner most fantasies.
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
He's here.
Can you feel that?
You know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
That sounds kinda gay, but since you're a guy, I guess it's okay.
How about these buns?
Tell me, Cindy. Would you ever tell me "Stop. If you loved me you'd stop."
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
Didn't I just say that? Fucking listen. Anyway, I did it all for Carolyn. He never appreciated her, but I worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. So, I came back for you. Just like I did for Carolyn.
He won't let us go. He's going to kill us.
What are we gonna do?
My child you are the only survivor.
I'm sorry.
Nah, I need a place to stay. So how do you like being in college?
I finished all the interviews.
Let me see the files.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Are you sure it's not the tape?
That's why we came here, remember?
That's right.
You're not wearing a belt.
I came as fast as I could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. If I tickle my ass before...
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Yo son, check this out.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Get out?! What does it say?
Mrs. Sutphin?
You said you hated him.
Do you have the musical, "Annie"?
Why?
But Mom, the video's not over.
Bye, Birdie.  Chip, honey... I know it's hard being a teenager but I understand... I'm your mother and I love you.
God, Mom!  What's the matter?
Tell me the truth, Mom! It's ok with me, really! Are you a serial killer?
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
I'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
Look at this!  "Hillside Strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Don't wake the kids...
"P" as in...
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Hinkle... do you drink?
So you do drink?
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
Did Carl Padgett buy something you wanted?
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Dr. Sutphin said no sweets for you.
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Where?
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
It's not just for myself I'm asking. Her sister is here. The kid's half crazy with anxiety.
How much have you got?
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Redi's all right.
I did her hair.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
He was a kind little man in his way  and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
You told me you were pretty good with youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler  She runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a kindergarten teacher.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Things changed, Mary. The reasons for finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle things.
That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -
But I'm better than a detective. I have an understanding of people - and a love of them -- an understanding of the city - -
Do you think he knows about this?
I'm not going to wait. I'm going out -- laugh, dance --do all the things I used to do.
If it is true  there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.
Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume"  and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
I think I understand without your telling me. I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven't written for ten years.
I'd forgotten.
Perhaps.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice  that's it, isn't it?
A strange collection. You're like the false god you worship... fallen angels, all of you.
Is it about Jacqueline?
Leave me your address, and if I find anything, I'll get in touch with you.
I'm afraid not.
Why?
I can almost feel your doubt about what I'm saying, Mary.
But she was here?
Yes?
Why
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
But he also wrote --
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Oh, uh-huh.
Anyway, I think the mind is very flexible as far as time is concerned.
Nine years?
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
It's up to you. But I warn you, if you tell me something personal, I might do the same.
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
You're in therapy?
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Not much to see, I'm afraid. I'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
What kind of personal project?
How did you know?
I want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because I know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
It won't. Are you ready?
Yes.
I loved her for how good she made me feel, and I hated her for how good she made me feel. And at that time, I tended to express my feelings non- verbally. I couldn't handle anyone having that much control over my emotions.
And now you can?
Interesting analogy.
God, I m so mad at him!!
I've told you.
But I don't understand --
Yes.
Yes.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
I don't know.
I want to know why you are the way you are!
Graham...
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Mmmmm...
Ann, you are completely paranoid. Not ten minutes ago I wanted to make love for the first time in weeks, and you act like I'm dipped in shit. You know, I think there are a lot of women that would be glad to have a young, straight male making a pretty good living beside them in bed with a hard on.
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
Bastard...
God damn you!!
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Do you want to leave therapy?
Is he? Strange, I mean?
Why?
Why, so you can go after him?
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
I don't want to talk about it.
What kinds of questions?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
I was just trying to --
There's a phone here.
You want me to leave?
She didn't give you my address?
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
How long will it take?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Your first sexual experience.
Very much live.
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
Then what happened?
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
I would.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
You know what I mean.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
What's so stupid about it?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
Who?
No.  You said three-fifty?
What tapes?
So is my wife, asshole!!
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
John Millaney.
Yes?
He said immediately.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
C'mon, Forsythe. Are there any more on the list?
I don't know. I just thought I might want to call you. I don't know.
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
Did I say anything?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
That you, Rog?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I wouldn't mind doing Janet one or two favours.
About Brad's family?
Do you watch 'Dentonvale,' Janet?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Out of self comes selflessness.
In a way...
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Macy Struthers -- God I must have been blind -- still, the weaker the man, the dumber the blonde.
Really.  What'll I pin this on?
I'm not going, Janet.
Could you tell us a little about it?
I won't be a party to this.  I want to see Brad.
Poor Brad.
YOUNG BLOOD
Brad!
F for...
Ah.  Mr. And Mrs. Majors.  How wonderful to see you.  I am Dr. Cosmo McKinley and this is my sister, and colleague, Nation McKinley.
THAT MINIMAL
We love you, Baby.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Huh.
Highliner.
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
Great. You look great.  You both do.
What happened to you guys?
I am one of those guys.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
What?
And Lexapro, yes.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
Are you chewing gum?
She is very hot.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
What?
Besides what?
Understanding of what?
That was three years ago after that first party!
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Nope.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
What do you think's going on?
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Is it the money thing?
With Maya.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
She tell you she was married?
Yep. Quite a day.
You broke some.
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
So what gems do you have in your collection?
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
Oh. You mean... today?
A paper?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah? Like what?
Maya.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Hello?
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Where are you?
So what do you think?
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Oops. Sorry.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Houdini's sick.
See this is why we're not watching those news reports. People get obsessed.  I'm letting go now.
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
I don't want you to die.
...Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He'll always take care of her.
Explain noises.
I cursed.
It was very dark.
That roof is over ten feet high.
Yes.
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
It's getting stronger.
Yes.
It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
What about Isabelle?
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
I wouldn't do that. You're going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
If we charge them, they won't have a chance. But we gotta get to the horses.
Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
Emmett.
That's all over as far as I'm concerned, Emmett. I'm satisfied.
You'll never make it.
Gotta go.
I just came out to say goodbye.
I had to get up anyway.
Where's the pinto going?
Going to Turley, was it?
I understand.
Hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she's got a hard idea for living.
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
I paid the government for it, all right. That don't mean much out here.  Malachi, I'm living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. Hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
Never will again.
Mr. and Mrs. Parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. We'll work them together.  Mine starts right over there. It's all I've ever wanted. Pretty land, isn't it?
Sure we are. We're leaving at dawn.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
You misunderstand. I want you out of town. In fact, I want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
We'd rather stay.
It's been a while.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
You've got a legitimate job.
I just got to town.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.
So we understand each other?
You wouldn't be needing any help around here, would you? Maybe with the gambling?
What's this?
You really are a gambler.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
I think he owes more to you.  But that's not important now.  I know what's going on between you two.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
Christ --  Elaine, I know how it looks but...  ... it would mean a lot to Viktor if you'd go with him to the Oscars. If you won't do it for him, please do it for me.
No!  You will not give in to that blackmailing bitch!
Don't be ridiculous.  I arranged a press conference.
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
She'll drive herself.
I'll send you her resume.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
Everyone you know is lying.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
-- Viktor, are you with her?  Is she there?
... Simone.
How much wine have you had?
Yes -- oh my, God.  Is that you, Simone?!  I've been wanting to talk to you.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
Thank God for you, Faith.  I know this is above and beyond the call of duty for a stand-in.  You don't know what a service you're performing for Simone -- shielding her from those animals.
Yes, call me Simone.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
But she's right there!  I must feel her!
-- an emotional wall, I know. That's why --
No.  In fact, between us, she doesn't really exist.
-- Please, get away from me.
You want me to call Security?
What's that?
Not quite how I imagined it --
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
You know, I... don't know.
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
No, that was me.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Do I know you?
It's a yacht.
It's bogus.  You used an old library shot for the background.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I traced her to a nursing home.  A young woman fitting Simone's description dropped her off five years ago.
That doesn't prove a thing -- wait until I get a court order for a blood test.
My God, you've got one?
Long live the First Amendment.
I don't understand.
Would you like me to read?
But that's Simone's part.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
A star is...
The only real truth is in the work.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
I walk this way to school with Tommy Tammisimo.
He hates me.
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?
Know what?
...So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
What?
I didn't know you were funny.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
I don't know.
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
I wish I were somewhere else.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?
They're right here.
Lots of things.
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Don't get mad.
Yeah.
Where is she?
She says she's sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. She just likes it a lot.
Yes, Cole?
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
S-ssstop that!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
Yo. "Billy Bob". Was I two beats behind, or what?
Okay, Farm Boy. Joke's over. You've been playin' me from jump street. Where's my Nikes?
Get off his case sweetie.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Bitch.
I happen to be a professional.
Suzie???
No shit.
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
Should we be doing this, dude?
-- It's not me!
It's time to make amends.
Throw me one.
Is that all you ever think of? Suppose I was really hurt!
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Then why go back now?
What's wrong?
Picked up one of those shears. Blade's razor sharp. -- Where is everyone?
HE'S STILL OUT THERE!!!
Carl.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
And that makes you look like a squid?
Pretty, ain't they?
Wait! Dammit, Bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? How, unless you bring Grant in alive? Your best chance of doing that is with me. I can talk to him --
Where are you?!
Rorschach.
You dig that rat out of the hole?
I got to leave my post.
Hey there, Chief.
Already ain't. Married a gal named --
He's teaching environmental science, Grant. Probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
It's just a work thing.
Welcome home.
Grant. Oh my God. What happened to your -- ?
I'll get if for you.
Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Look, you make this little run for me, I'll buy you a new rig.
Kate McConnell.
Who'd want to?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
An existentialist.
Driving?
Driving, talking to me...
Seriously?!?
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
How do you know?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
No what?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Save it. We got a long haul.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Yeah, guy?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
What's your twenty?
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Now what?
Yeah, but...
Go breaker.
My handle's Silver Tongued Devil and I'm here to tell you, your fellow CB'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
I think you're just yellow.
I still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
Now, you just find him, son.
Uh -- well, yes, uh just in terms of the men up there now, my team, he's serving lunch and dinner and just doing general upkeep so --
Is your security team armed?
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
Uh, yeah.
Ww... uh...
Mmm-hmm.
Are you on a land line?
No, what did you say on the machine?
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...When did you know all this?
...Are you insane?
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
...So you knew all this and yet y--
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
Georgia on my mind wit'yo fine ass. You know you saved this black man.
-- never in a million girl --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
I want to hear your version.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
What?
Is there anybody else here?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Rheya.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
What will you say?
Kelvin, you awake?
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Not necessarily.
What happened?
Get out --
She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
Just get him to stop.
Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
What are they?
To calm your anxiety.
Book?
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
Well.  He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
Yes.  Yes.
Who have you been talking to?
Sartorius.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Can you sleep?
Gibarian.  He was here.
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Yes, you are --
Gibarian was under enormous --
You didn't like him?
Straight ahead.
What do you want?
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Where?
You're dealing with a psychopath. He gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you'll be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
My ass if falling.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
You got no idea...
For how long?
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
What shit, honey?
Honey.  You got him.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
Coming to bed?
Did you hear what I said?
What was that?
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you do tonight?
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
What about when she goes out?
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
He's got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  We've got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
At my house...!
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Who's Joey Venza?
You in this with me?
Tell me I'm dreamin'.
You're here 'til what time?
Hold it...!
She trusts me.  She'll do what I say.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Sexual tension...
And Flash isn't?
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Oh, sure.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
"Scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
I bet you don't think I appreciate you, Parker.  I do.
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
Thank you.  Now, repeat after me-- Spider-Man is a good guy. On the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
Oh, that?  It'll come unstuck in a half-hour or so. Your mouth needs the rest.  Bye.
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
How very dull, Peter Parker.
I-- uh--
What's in the bag?  Garbage?
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
Hello.  Earth to Peter.  Are you listening?
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
Any sign of our friend?
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
Oh, not that.  You promised you'd burn it.
How is he?
Otto, I don't like Thorkel any more than you do.  But he has got a point.
I heard about Thorkel's order--
Hello, uh, Mr. Reiss?  I'm-- I'm the guy who wrestled Hulk Hogan the other day.  The guy in the mask?
The usual.  Heredity and environment.  What's the deal with Doc Ock?
I listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the Bhagavad Gita, the Indian holy book-- "I am become Shiva, Death-- the destroyer of worlds."  Octavius was...
Up here, Docky Ocky!
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Ready?
That's not the point, Cookie. The point is what do you do with him? You tip your mitt and the Jerries pull him out of here and plant him someplace else, like Stalag Sixteen or Fifteen. Or you kill him off and the Krauts turn around and kill off the whole barracks. Every one of us. So what do you do?
Now what kind of a crack is that?
Come on, Trader Horn! Let's hear it: what'd you give the Krauts for that egg?
How much more do we have to take from him?
How did he get over there?
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
You'd better get that blue blood circulating, because we're busting out of this stink-hole in exactly --  -- one minute and twenty seconds.
It's on me.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
I want to sleep. Give me five minutes on that couch.
Here we have a typical barrack. It houses seventy-five men. Every one of them has his own bunk, naturally.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Interesting.
Jawohl!
Good morning, Animal! What'll it be for breakfast? Scrambled eggs with little sausages? Bacon and eggs sunny- side up? Griddle cakes? A waffle?
Stop it, Harry!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Why do you do this to me every morning?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
It's chow, Animal! Chow!
Animal! When the war's over, remember I told you I'd fix you up with Betty Grable!
Me? What if she don't want me?
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
What do they always say?
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Do Grable.
I'll open mine now.
Hey, Animal! Animal!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Anything else?
Wait a minute. We have some rights here.  Why is this man being taken out?
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Anybody call?
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
Two packs of cigarettes say Dunbar never gets out of the compound.
Go on.
You could use a new one yourself.
I thought that's what you said. You're from Cleveland. And you were with the Thirty-sixth Bomb Group?
Thirty-fifth.
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
No use, Schulz. You might as well come clean. Why don't you just tell 'em it's me. Because I'm really the illegitimate son of Hitler. And after the Germans win the war you'll make me the Gauleiter of Zinzinnati.
The one you work with. Who is he? How do you do it?
This is me in Cincinnati.
That is my wife.
Have a nice time over there?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
Fear is a very difficult emotion to overcome. It's something we all have to learn to deal with.
Is she still angry?
What?
Data, this isn't the time.
That's it, Bridge- we're all out!
I am quite...preoccupied with concern about Geordi.
We're within visual range of the energy distortion, Captain.
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
This is the Nexus?
When the Enterprise-B beamed us off the Lakul, we were partially in the Nexus. The transporters locked on to us, but somehow everyone left a part of themselves behind.
Where is he now?
Guinan, can I leave the Nexus?
Well, may we have a look around?
You're a Starfleet officer and you have a duty to-
Yes.  Thank you.
Keep her together until I get back.
No.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Captain, are you all right?
Doctor, we're still conducting an investigation into the attack. Once we've completed our work, we'll be happy to allow you and your fellow scientists back aboard the observatory. Until then-
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Don't give me your Klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
An energy reading from 'C" deck -- from inside Mr. Spock's quarters...
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
It's okay -- I should have known you'd come... Saavik's right: this planet is unstable. It's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
Negative, on surface... A manufactured object.
I don't understand.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
We concur, Saavik. And Saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. I'm getting nervous...
Certainly, sir. How else can I keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Good shooting, Scotty.
This Vulcan -- is he alive?
My God...
My father says you have been my friend... You came back for me.
You would have done the same for me.
The ship... Out of danger...?
... Admiral, what's going to happen to Enterprise?
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Yes... I hear you.  I just had to try.
Of course... Now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
Wait! Give me a chance --
No.
I -- saw no future --
What must I do?
How can you tell that?
I'll be in my quarters. Execute course to the Federation Boundary.
My Lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
Sir, may I --
But it's damn irregular. No destination orders, no encoded i.d...
The <u>closet</u>?! Have you lost all sense of reality?
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
That's all you have to say?
Bless me, doctor; and what beams you into this neck of the woods?
Say thank you.
I've got the sick bay ready. Will someone please tell me what is going on?
There may still be time... you gave as good as you got.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
I don't think there's another piece of information we could squeeze into the memory banks. Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
Are you sure these are the coordinates?
I told you! I told you I saw a --
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
Where's Dr. Marcus --
It's the Genesis Wave!
How soon --
I don't mean to intrude.
I suppose I was.  I poured a drink. Would you like it?
It was just words.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
What are you looking at?
What are <u>you</u> looking at?
They won't --
Inoperative.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
Goodbye, Admiral. Oh, and don't count on Enterprise. She can't move. My next act will be to blow her out of the heavens.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Enterprise to Reliant. Come in, Reliant.
Saavik, for God's sake, tell her we're all right.
Mr. Scott, you old space dog. You're well?
Yes, Spock.
And who is this?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
The prefix code?
A distinct possibility.
Sporadic energy readings port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.
Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
May I speak, sir?
I failed to resolve the situation.
That's true, Admiral. All the memory cells have been emptied.
It doesn't make sense. These coordinates are well within Regula -- a plantoid we know to be lifeless and airless.
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
Stop engines.
Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
He's very human.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
You lied.
Now wait just a damn minute.
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Naturally.  So what is your problem?
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Team leader, this is team 2.   Come in, please...
Okay... Make nice and give us the ray gun.
Shields, Mr. Chekov.
Shields, aye.
I assure you that won't be necessary. We were only trying to help...
LDS?? Are you dyslexic on top of everything else? Come on, Lemme give you a lift. I have a notorious weakness for hard luck cases -- that's why I work with whales.
We don't want to be any trouble.
Go ahead.
Do you trust me?
See, yes. But we'll tag them with radio transmitters on a special frequency so we can keep tabs on them.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
It wouldn't be my first choice, no.
So. There we are.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
Yes... If you have a chart on board, I can show you.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Oh my God, we're too late!
He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Thank you, Admiral.
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
Surely you can be more specific...
Availability of fuel components; Mass of the vessel through a time continuum, and the probable location of Humpbacks, in this case, the Pacific basin.
Well, for one thing, you haven't quite got the hang of it.
I cannot tell a lie.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Status?
The tank will be finished by morning...
Mr. Scott cannot give me exact figures, Admiral. So I will...  Make a <u>guess</u>.
Warp two... three...
Maintaining impulse climb. Wing five by zero, helm steady.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
We're ready, sir. I've converted the Dilithium Sequencer to something less primitive. And Admiral -- I've replaced the Klingon Food Packs. They was givin' me sour stomach.
Humpbacked - people.?
Admiral - how am I going to handle all that weight?
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
With pleasure.
Sill? What else would I be working with?
Transparent aluminum?
They are my friends.
Seeing my home planet from space for the first time...
You're what?
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child...
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
For what purpose?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Captain, the Son'a hostages declined to be examined. I had them confined to quarters.
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Prepare to transport the 'hostages' to the ship...
It's nothing personal data. You have to remember these people have rejected technology. And you...
A ship,
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
You're not going to launch anything until...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
You've done a terrific job, Jean- Luc. Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How's Data?
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
The Prime Directive doesn't apply. These people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be immortal. We'll simply be restoring their natural evolution.
But I would need at least three minutes on the bridge.
If we could lure him away from the bridge...
Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure them in the aft cargo hold... see that Picard joins them...
Do you know how they were damaged?
Fail-safe?
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Options?
My name is Sojef, Captain.
Scanners are off line!
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
It says here that some form of genetic damage has apparently prevented the Son'a from procreating...
Why don't you try sitting up?
There must be some good people... even in this time.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
His automatic reflexes are fluctuating. We've got to get him on a respirator.
It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
Isn't it better like this...?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
I am the Borg.
"APR cell count?" What the hell are you talking about?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Where's you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
Bring the warp core on-line. I'll lay in a heading.
ATR setting...
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
From another planet.  Oh, I almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
And you know all this... because <U>you're</U> a space-man too...
No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
No... I'm from France.
Port battery, ready sir!
Return to our own time?
Unless you'd like to stay.
What are they doing?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana.
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed...
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Specifically of...?
Once we're beyond the shield they should be able to pick it up two sectors away.
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
For 27 years I have been Ship's Surgeon and later Chief Medical Officer aboard the USS Enterprise. In three months I'm due to stand down.
They'll respect him now...
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Torpedo room--?
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
Chancellor. We've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting place on Earth.
He's got it.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
I always wanted to try that.
Just the prototype.
Bless you, Sulu.  Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
I know your father's the Vulcan Ambassador for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this: they're animals.
What is it?
Captain...
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
I too was blind. I knew about HER - and I did nothing. I trusted too much.
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
The only way to find out if a man's trustworthy...
A lie?
That could take hours!
Nevertheless.
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
What exactly does that mean?
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
To seek out new life and new civilizations. Zephyr. Cochrans own words. When Charles Darwin set out on the H.M.S. Beagle, on his journey into the unknown... he sailed without a single musket.
Sir.  I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding. I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse, laughter through tears, but I could not help wondering about the human capacity for expressing both pleasure and sadness simultaneously.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
To new worlds...
He is very observant.
Ready, Captain.
No, sir, it is not possible. The B-9 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced. But even if they were, he would not be me.
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Why?
Why is it moving?
If you wouldn't mind.
How can you be certain?
Imzadi. This is so good.

You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.
I won't do it.
Coordinate our attack with the Valdore's tactical officer. Triangulate fire on any shield impacts.
Captain, the Hemingway has arrived to tow us to spacedock.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
Counselor Troi, report to the bridge.
Serving with you has been an honor.
I am, Commander Riker...  May I touch your hair?
It's not quite the face you remember.
In time, Jean Luc.
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
I won't defend my life to you.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
It's just the two of us now, Jean Luc, as it should be... Your ship and mine... You and me.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Yes.
I don't know.
That's your life... not mine.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Report!
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
The bond is broken.
Praetor...
How many Warbirds will you need?
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Praetor.
Gate three. It's boarding now.
I'll take that.
I'll have to run your card off now.
Make any money?
Where did you stop last?
We're going... Damn!  We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
Contain it and get back to me.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
That's the chance we have to take.
This is George Fox...
I won't let anyone hurt you.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Please.
Steering wheel...
Steering wheel.
Space?
In your pocket, please...
You. Mouth closed.
I...
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
No.
Yes.
No... The closest...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Jennyhaydn.
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Yes?
Yes.
You liked my singing?
Put that back.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
You can have one.
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
The yellow one.
I will.
You sure this is your car?
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
Twenty-eight years.
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
How did it happen?  What was Iris doing riding around with Jeriko wearing a wire?
You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
I'll set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.
That's not sayin' much.
You were lucky, Max.
You alright?  Y'okay?
Let's work it.
What do you mean?
This is what we laughingly refer to as a plan, right?
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
No.  I suppose not.  I didn't know you were colorblind, Max.
So... I killed Tran.  Then you ran in, being on his payroll, and shot me.
I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.  Okay, okay... I got a deal with some a the paramedics.  My guy pages me and I pick it up at the morgue.  So whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be worth at least a grand.  Right?
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Sure, like this low-grade shit here, some girl in a fight with her boyfriend... it's a test-pattern. Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Charm.
Commissioner Strickland.
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
That would be no.
No, you're just trying to get off.
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
But that doesn't add, does it.
How's Zander?
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
This is bad.
You sure?
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
Mace... you're a girl.
Got your ticket?
Hey, Lenny.  We made it.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
Yup.  He was Jeriko's manager.  Bummer, Tran!  Lost your golden goose.  Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
Um... he was older.
Excuse me, a salesman gets done in his car and you call the FBI?
I hope that wasn't a joke because I can assure you, from personal experience, the FBI does not have a sense of humor.
I'd appreciate it if you kept this to yourself.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
You heard?
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
I don't mean to be rude, but...
What are you...?
Don't say that. Don't even think that. The next thing we'll be hearing about "Zorro Killer" in the media -- this hasn't gotten out, has it?
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
I suspected, but you were the one Low contacted. That's why I brought you back here.
We need to put out an NCIC inquiry.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
You are so fucked up.
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
Yeah, you know the vic's car, he was killed this side of the state line, the car then pushed across the border. This by an Unknown Subject, presumably the killer, who left no fucking evidence except the snapshot, which may or may not have been accidental.
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
Working the net isn't that different from ordinary undercover work. You go into the community, walk their walk, talk their talk, gain their confidence.
What's this country coming to?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I know.
I've been thinking about this.
Does Koessler ask about me?
You mean --
Did they disconnect Testa's computer?
You should have seen the store manager at Parade of Shoes. She was inconsolable.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
There's the Agency issue. I think Koessler may suspect something already. We're not on the best footing with him as it is.
Where are you? Everybody's looking for you.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
You okay?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
I know you, Lionheart. I watched your mind work, heard your dirty thoughts --
I want to help you.
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
"Computer Investigation and Infrastructure Assessment Center." Quantico out of MIT -- you're a techie?  Okay, you screwed up once. So did half the guys here. That's why they're here.
I don't...
How far is Amarillo?
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
Murman!
He's a brilliant man. Brilliant enough to catch you.
Shit.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?
You like laughing at the misery of others?
I've seen you somewhere... Where have I seen you?
You're a comedian?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
I'd say about two weeks.
My reputation seems to have preceded me.
It's been six months and I'm just starting to get over it.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
Like what?
What else?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
...not until you book it...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
I'm considering taking a job as a "Goofy".
...I heard it took four days to light for that shot...
...And she's with someone else.
A couple of high rollers like you?
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Sorry?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Well, who represents you back east?
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
When I lived in New York they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. I got off the plane in L.A. six months ago and all I got to show for it is a tan.
...The red piece of shit over there...
Right.
So I don't call either way.
I mean first you'll pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really won't care.
Unless she comes back first.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
No problem.
I don't think I'm gonna take it.
What do you have? A Pluto call back?
What'd you get?
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
Sue. His dad was big Johnny Cash fan.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
Oh boy.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
Are you ready to order?
I don't know...
What are you talking about? Vegas?
VEGAS.
What Vegas?
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
This is fuckin' post-pubescent Disneyland.
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
You gotta do it.
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
I don't know, what? Thirty, Forty maybe.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Did she, or did she not smile.
What are you, nuts? You think she's coming back?
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
I don't know...
You can't think like that, baby. It's hard, I know. I've been there. Not for six years, but I know. You just gotta get back out there.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Wait...  She's crying. I finish. I hold up my finger like "Wait a second". They sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. I look up and they all start clapping, and now they're all crying. Even the camera guy.
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
I don't think so.
...a day...
What?!?
What time's this party tonight?
It's on.
Which one?
What?
A day.
They're a finesse team...
Is he cute? Ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
...and you got big claws and fangs...
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.
It's on.
...Well, then, I guess we don't have to worry about him anymore.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
The food is on the table.
You take care of Paulie?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Are you worried about security for your million?
Should I bring him in.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
Yes.
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I understand, Michael.  But you must make a family, you know.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
Yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a Governor, a President even, nothing's impossible here in America.
Where are you going?
What is it?
I know about what you mean!
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
Give them some money and send them home.
Oh Christ Tom, I didn't mean it that way.
We're all tired...
What about that Tattaglias?  What will they do about Bruno?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Will you give this to him.
Mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
They're waiting to see my father.
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
I'm thinking about it.
When will I see you again?
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
What?
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
How can you be sure?
That's not how Pop would have played it.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Cut it out.
A million times.
We're going to New Jersey?
I do renounce him.
He talked to you?
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
You straightened my brother out?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
I don't like you.
Shut up.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
It's just an undercoat. 
Who? Oh, Tom, hello, how are you? We thought you'd disappeared. We were going to send out a search party.
Can you mix a martini?
You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
No, no brothers, no sisters.
You've got to get a new jacket. Really. You must be sick of the same clothes. I'm sick of seeing you in them.
I thought you'd missed the train.
Freddie drove me back in his car.
To Mongi. You're cheerful tonight.
I've got plans!
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Why?
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Dick -- you've got to hear this!
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
The landlady -- as far as I could tell, the landlady said he was here right now.
Pretty good. Sticking with hot water.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I never said that!
Frances?
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Is he really not here?
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
Very.
I told you. He gave them to me.
I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Emily.  Just kidding.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
It's okay.
No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the --
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Tom, are you okay?
You try. You try talking to her.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Well that would be even better gossip.
It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday?
Never. We've had many requests and, of course, we say no -- even to your fiance.
It is a little coarse, yes.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
You like ball games?
Who mam?
I don't know...
Oh, I appreciate that, Betsy mam. I'll be here at four o'clock exactly.  And... ah... Betsy...
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
I can believe that.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
Huh?
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
Well... mostly...
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just...
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
This is gotta be a game, right?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Betsy, come over here a moment.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
I musta been stoned.
Listen...
I can leave anytime I want.
Who's a killer?
You a narc?
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
You're not much with girls, are you?
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
You don't have to.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
Twenty-six.
No.
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?
Look, um, if you give me your name and address, we'll send you the information on how to apply.
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
What's going on?
Get it.
So howsit?
Wiz?
Yeah?
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
I know.
Had a close one.
Could we change the subject?
Stick with Carla.
Spit it out.
Motor oil?
I'll go.
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
I believe you.
Did you bring along something to read?
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Do you have the...
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
Oh...
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Sir, that is true.
Yes... yes, I do.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Start with what you knew then.
That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath.
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
Or the Bijou.  Either one.
Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town.
Wait'll you see the inside!
We've been closed for a while.
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
Why?
Oh.  What... what time is it?
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
Anybody take it?
A few.
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
The G-man?
Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
You smell gas?
What's his rent?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Peter, their hands are tied.  You see that, don't you?
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed.
That was beautiful.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name?
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
I suppose.  Thanks.
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Would you like some brandy?
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I know.
Good morning.
Yep.
Mmmm.
Where would I get a boat?
Are you sure?
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Thank you.
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
You did say birds?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Yes, Mother.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
I couldn't ask you to.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Does this room look silly?
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
Oh.
I wonder if you could help me.
Well... yes, sir, there are.
The sign says strawberry finches.
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
You are, aren't you?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Do you expect me to believe...?
What do you do?
I do different things on different days.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that. 
I'm glad you do.
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
It's an uprising.
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Take wing!
What do you mean?
I hadn't thought of that.  And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
That... that... who was that?
I hardly think a few birds are going to bring about the end of the world.
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Scotch, light on the water.
How many gulls did you count, Mrs. Bundy?
Of course.
I'm Donald Fettes.
You asked to see me, ma'am?
Even so, I could never think of going on -- I've got to find some other profession.
You're over-excited, Mistress Cameron.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
Aye.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
I've heard of it.
But I must tell him -- he must know of it. Please -- tell me where he is.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
You see, it is completely out of the question.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
You can't -- can't!  Stop trying to bribe her with childishness about white horses. Let the child stand and walk -- her spine's all right.  I know it's all right.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
I will not have you use that name to me.
Afraid of what?
I'm not concerned about the child, Toddy.  It's you I'm thinking of, I'd like to see you prove that a lot of things I know haven't hurt Toddy MacFarlane any.
Now that wasn't a friendly thing I heard, Toddy.  Not at all friendly.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
I've had some experience.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I take no gifts from you.
Have another glass of something good, Toddy.
I've drunk enough tonight.
Yes, Doctor.
Where are they? Last chance.
I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
Think maybe knives do?
You lied at my trial.
Fuck. Me.
Not my arm! What you fucking want?
You're him. Corvis.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
Are you ok?
Erin. It's not your fault.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
All I knew, she was pulling away. It made me crazy.
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Why are there so many?
What were you yelling about?
Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr. Carpenter?
Almost negligible... With variation of parameters, this is the answer.
You'd have no objection to revealing yourself at this meeting?
No -- not at all.
Tell me what?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Sure. Didn't you ever hear of Arlington Cemetery?
Mr. Carpenter" -- you don't seem to know about anything.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
The present situation?
I'd be glad to.  Not now, of course -- with you alone.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby.  I don't suppose we could take him with us?
The picture starts at eight-fifty.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
I wonder if we ought to--
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
I don't know how to thank you.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention--  Bobby has such an active imagination.
Gort?  But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I suppose you know that Barnhardt does a lot of secret work for the Army.
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
Should I run him through?
Death to all vampires!
That's right.
We were gonna grab some food.
Hey, take it easy.
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
He's not glowing.
Just so you know:  If you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I'll stake you without thinking twice about it.
Of course not!
Max?  You men we're having company again?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
I know it was them, Star.  I'm sure of it.  He was working in the yard -- hammering something.  The yard was big with lots of grass.  There was no boardwalk and no ocean.  She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  I was there, too.  And a dog -- but I don't know its name.  I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog.  They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  And I was laughing, too.
I like Michael.
He looks dead.
See you later.
There's only three weeks left of summer, Michael.  Things are going to change around here when school starts.
Smells like something died.
That's the boardwalk, Sam.
In here?
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
Lucy.
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
He doesn't walk all over me.
Star.
Then it's not too late for us...
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
I was here first.
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
I'm making you a sandwich.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
What's the matter?
What do you want from us?
Pretty nasty out, Mac.  Thirty-five knots.
Yeah.
Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest.  Left the room for a bit.  When I came back, he was gone.
What?
Let go of me...
Don't get near 'em.  The plants! They're alive.  Those things can imitate anything...
Let's open it.  Now...
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
But...
What do we do about those three?
What are you doing?
Maybe we shouldn't make it.
A couple of hours.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down!
Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
He's dead.
What about Childs?
Get your gear on.
So what do you make of it?
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
It's got into the pub!  It's turned on the stereo!
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?
The Hall of Books.
I think we should go on by ourselves.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
But you escaped.
Last night.
It's what they want you to see.
Vox?
This has to end.
End...?
Go back to the light.  You weren't made for this.  I was... I was made for this moment.
I should hope not...  ... Alexander... Make them read my books.  Tell them who they are. Who they could be.
Alexander.
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
How?
I'm afraid your indignation is lost here.  I have no more "human" response to the Eloi then you would have to a carrot.  It's just how we live now.
No...
I could have a hundred Morlocks here in thirty seconds.
It's spectacular...
I just love mechanical things.
Ahhh... I'm afraid I've got a prior commitment.
Dance with me...
... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth.  You see it over the rocks there?  Sailors consider that an omen of good fortune; the hunter watching over them on their travels... Are you listening to me, Alex?
Alex, what is it?
... One day he'll be discovered by some future archeologists and they won't know what to make of him. The thick brow, so lacking in imagination.  The dim little eyes, devoid of curiosity.
Where's the challenge in that?
In the future, we'll be better.
Alex, really... good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.
David... I appreciate your concern, I do.  But I ask you to have faith in me.  Just for a little while longer.  I'm working on something now.  Something... extraordinary.
You wouldn't believe me.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Kalen will tire you out if you let him.  He's always been curious. His father was firm with him but... it's just his way.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.
I'm going to sit with Kalen.  Keep the fire burning if you can.
You can see so many here.
Good night, then.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
You share dreams?  That's incredible.
What's it all for?
I'm a planner.  I help decide where the new towers go and what they should look like.
You liked it there.
Did you have fires at night?
It must have been safe.
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
This is where my journey started... right here.
Yes.
Someone you loved very much.
Is it?
Don't torture me -- do you have it?
I have it, but don't you think for one moment I'll be letting you go out in that filthy coat -- now go upstairs and change.  I've laid out your green coat.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
What are your people called?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
And you've no idea where he went?
But... what about Starks?
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
Who are you?
[Beat] You're his son?
Medication? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadaver drawer?
So, what, you guinea pig sick people to find out?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
That's too bad.
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
What should they be looking for?
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
I need to get this letter to someone.
And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided.
Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
Your mom take anything before this happened?
Yeah, but I don't know what.
You're just gonna walk?
I looked it up.
Why?
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
You're sure?
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
You don't understand.
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
Who...who kills me?
I do believe you...
Don't you go to jail for that?
'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
So what am I supposed to do?
Geez, how's that for a fucking "thank you"?
Where are you going?
[Beat] I was dropped off.
I only lit it because it was so cold in here. I'm sorry if...
Yeah. [Beat] How about you?
Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like that!  Haven't I told you I can't stand it when you holler in the morning.
Uh-huh.
What?
We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?
You didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
You girls are in some hot water.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Well, you'd best get something. Even if they didn't do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  I want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back.
A .38.
Oh shit.
You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I won't hurt you.  It's okay.
Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
Well, I guess I'd better...
You're a bank robber?
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
Can't it go to any office?
Who did it?
Hello...
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Shit!  I... I, which way?
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Yeah.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just play it by ear.  He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I am really sorry about this.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes, Thelma?
Eeuww.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
You awake?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Me too.  I feel awake.
Good.
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Shit!
Where?!
Are you going to apologize or not?
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted? How many we talking?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
Stop it!
Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Well why don't you look her up?
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Well... at least now you know.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
So... I see you made the news.
Oh come on, why would I lie?
Here, just have one of these then.
Oh yeah.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did.  I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Don't you want to know my name?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
-- He's in a cage?!
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So...
Mary ah, forget it.
Come on, what were you going to say?
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
Uh-huh.
So you found Mary?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
So she's married?
What are you doing?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
You know, I really should take your card.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't happy we'll send you the extra minute.'
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
What's a mook?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
You don't think they're too big?
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
No, it's an old football injury.
So who you taking to the prom?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Yeah?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Just relax, dear. Now, um... what exactly are we looking at here?
What are you doing?
Carrying out our mission, Mr. Secretary. If you don't mind, we're very busy right now. We need to be able to do our jobs.
Starshells.
Tomorrow...
Goddamn Stevenson. Jesus. Peace at any price. You'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two.
The other thing is...
Adlai can handle Zorin. He knows the inning and the score.
Slow down. Smell that?
What's it about?
Yes it is.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
That is correct.
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
What happens to you? I'm not leaving without you.
What about you? Where are you going?
So what've we got today?
Okay. Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into. Impress us. And do it fast.  You're in charge of keeping this quiet. If word gets out before we know what we're going to do, there'll be panic. And it'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them.
We have to try the blockades. It probably won't work. It may just be delaying the inevitable. But we can't just go to war without trying not to.
What about these low-level flights? They're starting in what? An hour? Do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?
He's right, we can't rescind DEFCON 2. The Soviets will think we've gotten sweet on them.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
What journey?
Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when --
Those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently.
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Cooch.  Where the fuck did they send us?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Jesus, you alright?
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
What are you --
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
His spiritual mother...
The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.
He also said "listen to the water."
Ray --
What are you talking about?
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
I thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin' song for him and everything.
Ray. Ray, don't let go now, Man. Ray...
You go to the council fire. I'm going back in.
Look. You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. You're from the reservation. It's a different world.
-- You desecrated it, it had to be burned.
Not for long, Richard. You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.
They said I'd never see FBI again, and I'm livin' with you fuckers. I don't feed ya information on the Warriors, it's back to the pen. I don't do this, back to the pen. Your word against my word. Against a con Indian's word. I really got a chance, man, right?
How the hell do you know?
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Keep talking, Yellow Bird...
That's a big comfort to me.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
Two miles.
There you go with those moves again.
Yes. I'll give you that!
It's not suffering anymore.
It's just as I thought.
You're totally insane.
Danger?
What?
I sit. I think. I play games.
How does it go?
Well?
Well what?
Well... What   is   it?
One SIXTH the speed of sound!
Yes sir.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
Okay, okay.
Yawing right.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
Well what?
Let me do the talking.
You think you can stay up with us.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
They should have warned you about that one.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
I guess I owe you one.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
He just won't engage. He can't do it, Skipper. He can't get back on the horse.
What the hell you doing?
Bad?
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Yes sir.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
No bother.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
Where's yours?
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Get it, please.
I'll go encode your room key.
Well, my boy, you're a hero.
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
Do you expect me to believe you?
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
No, sir.
I know that.
They've got Quaid!  They're protecting him!
I'm with an very important client.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
What do you want?
Think about it.  Your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. Everything after that--the chases, the trip to Mars, your suite here at the Hilton--these are all elements of your Rekall Holiday.  And Ego Trip: You paid to be a secret agent.
Any news of Quaid?
On his way.
You tell me.
They sell fake memories.
I did?
That son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
I've got a lock!  There!
Would you please repeat the destination?
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
What are you doing?
Muggers?!  Doug, are you all right? What happened?
You went to those brain butchers?!
Forget Rekall, will you!  These men were going to kill me...
I'm not your wife.
I'm honored.
I didn't know you were so kinky.
Nooo!  I would never do anything to hurt you.  I want you to come back to me.
I'm not interested in Saturn.  I said Mars.
First of all, Doug, when you go Rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the Hilton; plus all the major sights:  Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals, and of course...  Venusville.
All right.
I think you better leave.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
The one in the mine!
Negative copy on that, Pham, check your frequency.  I'm on forty-nine.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
He'll never make it!  They're gonna get him!
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.
If there was one nearby I'd probably ask him.
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
You're gonna get us hung up.
Probably up a pole starving itself to death.
Those assholes are supposed to be <u>fixing</u> the goddamn road!  Hey!  Where are you guys?  People gotta use this road, you know! You on a booze break or what?!
Pham, we don't want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  They better be fast.
You know, I hate to be crude, but I'm gonna have to take care of some business here.
Its tires are flat...
Well...that's it.  We're not getting off this rock...
Road's in!  Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing, get in <u>People</u> magazine...
Somebody paying you to do this?
The con...!  Oh my God.
Yeah, geography.
Darn it!
Don't hurt him.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Good morning, Mr. Dowd. Do you think you might be up to cross-examining Mr. Ortega this morning?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
-- an angel dust dealer --
-- Listen: "November 5, 1980. Cecil Stipe walked into 5th Precinct. Says he witnessed Chin shooting, saw suspect's picture in Post. Says Shu Kai Kim wrong man."
That DD-5.
Uh, Eddie? The, um, ballistics guy, George...? He called, and...  His tests show that Shu's gun fired the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin.
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
I've got a meeting in Chinatown.
...Jesus!
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
You're doing a murder case?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
-- Find him?
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
Figures.
Racist asshole came at me.
Afraid of what?
Oh come on, Cecil.
Of course you know Dean Rabin, one of my Assistant D.A.s. Dean generally handles nuisance cases like the... what's the man's name?
The witness is recalcitrant, your Honor -- I had to personally make a body attachment this morning -- it took two Marshalls to drag him here!
Mr. Dowd, I was personally involved with all phases -- and principals -- of the investigation.
Lou Sklaroff, Vin Badalato, Dave Montell.
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
No.
I followed you here from court.
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
A soldado, he runs messages and materiel between the regiments...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
We can do it right here.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
Where is the ring?
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Her left arm. It was numb. She said she couldn't use it. Said it had no feeling. Probably from the drugs she was taking.  I just thought I ought to tell you.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
Crushed skull. Probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Do you want to talk?
Goodbye, Muffin.
What can I tell you?
Hey, Pete. Can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
No... hell, no. Just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "E" starin' at me.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Fill 'er up.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
James...
You mean the ones you pity.
Hiking?
I don't want to offend the customs of your country.
Let me see.
We're late to get to your mother.
Hello, Laura. Hello Sarah. Where's my axe?  "I'm hungry".
Neither is mine. And can't we talk about something serious for a change.
Leland...
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
She's the only nurse who isn't testifying for the Doctors.
Nothing.
Four cases in three years...
The man's an ambulance chaser...
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
I thought I would need it.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I swear to you I wouldn't have turned the offer down unless I thought that I could win the case...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
Her sister said she ate one hour prior to admittance... she...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
And you wrote that...
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Right. Who called?
Her doctors killed her.
I'm sorry...?
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of...
I understand.
Uh-huh. My nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so I stopped by.
What did she say?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
What is it?
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?
I've got to work...
Well, then what are you doing here?
You think I'm pushy now, wait 'til I get you on the stand...
...You saw her?
Yes. Yes, I have.
...fifty thousand dollars?
He's not in, Sir.
What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
One lousy letter eighteen months ago... I try to throw a fuckin' case your way...
Frank, but not now. Frank. You're trying to wipe out some old business. But not now. I understand. But you go call 'em back. You call the Bishop back.
Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...'  They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse?
Jimmy? Bushmills.  Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
Today is Tuesday. What?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
The Doctors.
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
It's an enemy sneak attack.  Let's get outta here!
It's no meteor, that's for sure!
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
What's he like?
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Is that... machine...?
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
What was it like?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
He's excited about the script.  You should be too.  It stars you.
Just an earthquake, Dylan.  Every once in a while we get a few.
No, you don't.
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
He was just here!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
Who?
I can't sleep there, Mommy.  Please!
What...what is that?
Yeah...how'd you know?
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
John.  It's Heather.  I need help!
You got it.  What's happening?
Holy...
I know how Chase really died.
Yes.
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
It can be captured, sometimes.
Like the Genie in the bottle.
If Freddy's loose, I mean, in your script, where's he going to go?  Another age?  Another form?
Isn't there anyone that can stop him?
I don't know if it has, really.  With the exception of One and Three, I've pretty much kept out of it.  I'm working in television now.  The hours let me spend more time with my husband and little boy.
No, not really.  I...
Do you let your child watch your movies?
I can take it.
Because we believed we could make an impact out here.  Self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
Carry on.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Fifteen.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's no my fault I was born first. Besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
That's not why he's sending me.
Can we talk?
So... What happened?
What'd you do?
My parents don't do it anymore.
Depths of hell... Ohio.  How 'bout you?
What are they doing?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
So when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
Albatross?  Doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
And I would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
Well, what does it have to do with? Us?
Son-of-a-bitch.
What's that?
We'll think of something.
This isn't just a story!!  It's history made allegory.  It is a philosophical handbook for life!  It holds the secret of this very voyage.
You've gotta be kidding?
Phil.  What are you doing?
Fandango, Junior.  I'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
I'm sorry...
What are you blubbering about?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
Is it true that the reason you expelled Philip Boutillier...
I used to helm a school ship.  A long time ago.
... Absolutely not.
What's Cao Ben?
What's that?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
You hitched yet?
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
In a fire, as I recall.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
Here she goes again...
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
Yeah?
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
Actin' funny how?
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Who knows, baby?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
You ready for this?
More'n likely.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
You upset with me?
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
It's okay by me, peanut.
You talk to 'im some?...
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
LULA!!!!
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Course I am, mama.
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
What if I told you not to?
I'm afraid his car is gone, Mrs. Fortune.
Have it your way... But you want it.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Through the forehead?
No... But...
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Sure... I figured I'd see you sometime...
I didn't see nothin'...
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
She's a transvestite.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
So. Is he any good?
He's a boxer. A flyweight.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Is it a little late to call the Chancellor?
So what's the problem?
First I see if Hannah will let me borrow her car.
Want some help with that?
He said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
'That's my car, motherfucker.'
You'll be all right then. Look at Carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
No...
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Sure.
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
That's really it.
It's feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. It must've cost Dr. Gaskell a lot.
Yea, James.
Thank you.
The guy on the phone.
What'd you tell him?
That's a big book you're writing.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
But... ?
Professor Tripp?
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
When we fall, we fall hard.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
How can you tell?
Want one. They're incredible. Incredible.
It feels really... good... here.
Jesus...  Look, James, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. However, I think it's best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
So, why did you take me up there?
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I eat.
Six. Their plane went down right outside Scranton.
Near Carvel?
Thanks for that. He all right?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
James. This is my editor, Terry Crabtree.
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
Hey.
No, it's okay. I just can't believe I left it out in the open like that. Crabtree hasn't been in here, has he? Poking around?
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
She's left before...
Is the thing -- is it over?
Who's gun is that?
You got me.
You heard? How?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
James Leer.
Would Walter really press charges?
I lost it all.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
That sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
Grady?
Oh?
Is it good?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
I was thinking of you.
Where you stand?
One other thing. About this kid, this student of yours -- Leer -- James Leer. You wouldn't know how I could get in touch with him, would you?
I might have his number on campus.
Are you riding with me, James?
I could swear I had a '63 Chateau Latour in here. You haven't seen it, have you?
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
Something wrong with that?
Annette? She's good... tense.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
It's my own design. You won't find another table like it in the world.
You need a table.
It wasn't like that.
She's got all this new furniture now. She said it didn't fit anymore, so I kept it in the attic. I thought you might like it.
I've got some good news.
Next week? The week after?
Ask me. Ask me anything.
How does it sound?
I'd love to hear it.
Something like that.
That was terrific.
Got something to hide?
Fairy tales?
No.
Neither do I.  What's the one with the woodsman?
What's with the boxes?
I'd say you're moving.
Why's that?
Just trying to be helpful.
Can I ask how old you are?
No you're not.
Banished... yeah.
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Robin?
Are you sure?
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.
Why not?
Reflect.
Try it.
Honest? No.
How do you feel about that?
Then why are you talking about this?
What are you afraid will happen?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
Will I ever be normal?
I couldn't say.
How do they know?
You don't know!
I don't know.
I don't know.
That's not a helpful answer.
To relax.
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
When I say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
No. When I say the word "pretty," when I say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
I'm only asking questions.
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
How do you feel about that?
Southern light.
I'll buy a plant.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
It's been a while since...
Why do you want to know?
You're not joking.
How young?
What?
Being here, with me.
Who doesn't?
I'm not scared.
Don't do that.
Nice shot, Lins.
Bud!  Hippy's on the bitch-box.  It's a call from topside.  That new company man.
I'm taking you back out.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Thanks.  No, I can handle it.  Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters.  In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Brace yourself.  We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
Hey, Lins...  I'm glad your here.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
I need you to believe me, Bud.  Look at me.  Do I seem stressed out?  Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I think it likes you.
It's flooding like a son of the bitch.
They'll come out after us.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
It is insane.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
'Fish'?
That thing was probably their version of Big Geek... like an ROV.
Lady, we better fish or cut bait.
4800 feet.  It's official.
Anna... Maybe it would be better to wait a while.
But where are you going?
Used to what?
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
These people are contemptible. They have no sense of dignity at all.
Has she ever spoken to you about me?
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Then why do you say them?
What! Get married?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Good night, my love.
Have you ever been in love?
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
At one time the Aeolian isles were all volcanoes.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.
Don't worry, we've got everything.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
And how come you're up so early?
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
No.
No.
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
It's not that... it's not that...
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Well, who in particular?
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Down... there.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
Yes I do,  but I want you to...
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
How did she know that?
Somebody told her.
Agnes...
Do you?
No.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
What did you do?
You can tell me.
What?
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Doctor Livingston.
Of telling you.
Did you want it to come out?
Why were you afraid?
No.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I ate.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Agnes who did you see?
For what he made me go through.
What did you do?
Marty, what are you doing here?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Would you tell me why the hell this is taking so long.
Why?  You've done nothing to show any progress.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
You have proof?
No, no, no...
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
Well you're probably right about that. It certainly can't help Sister Agnes to have this investigation continued for any length of time.
Do you still go to church?
Yes... I...
Obviously there was.
Why do you think that?
And what happened?
This was before her pregnancy?
What?
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
I am...
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
What is it?
We'll see about that.
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
Nothing...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Right...
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Do you want to become one?
Begin what?
Don't be ridiculous.
This is insane.
But how did it happen?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
She is an innocent.
That's what I have to believe...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
Did you know she was pregnant?
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
Before or after you killed the child?
The usual ten per cent?
Lay them down.
Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
Not much cop without 'em, is it?
Why aren't you at work?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Sure.
You don't think...
Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
I'm afraid I don't understand.
But I won't.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
It's Paul's grandfather.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Aye, I knew you were.
Is she?
And cunning.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Parading's better!
Aaah ... stop picking on me... you're as bad as the rest of them.
Where are you off to?
What are they saying?
I'll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
Hello, Grandfather!
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
All right, how about Ringo? I mean ... he's very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
Oh for Pete's sake, It's only a joke.
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Well ... everyone's entitled to two, aren't they, and this is me other one.
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
Look he's a mixer and a trouble maker!
Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
Hello.
Well, you look like him.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
I would have said so.
Aye, but you know him well.
You're a window rattler, son.
But...
It's not my fault.
He's been gone a long time.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
Oh they've probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
Oh, he's gone to my club, has he?
Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
I've got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, he's done it.
Hell, we're equipped --
Approaching point of origin.  Closing at 20 kilometers, 15 and slowing. Ten.  Five.  Gentlemen, we are directly above the source of the transmission.
How do you feel, Dell?
Just a minute, hold it, I'm checking.
Why, what's wrong?
Yes, I know what they make it out of, so what?  It's food now.  <u>You're</u> eating it.
Oh -- God -- oh --
Martin, this is Jay.  The intakes are clogged with dust.  We overheated and burned out a whole cell.
Hey, guess what?
We could put on our pressure suits and blow all the air out of the ship.  That would kill it.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
What do you mean?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Oh no!  We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
I don't buy that.  There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
What?  What was that?
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Don't count on it.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Well, we can't go anywhere in this darkness.  How long till dawn?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
No, it's coming.
Yes, thank heaven.
And what do we do when we find it?
I've got Hunter... and something else as well, in front of him.
They're on the next level up.
First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food.
Let's hear it.
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Martin?
Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
Let's hear it.
So what do we do?  Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
Headache?  Dehydration?
Better?
Me either.  I tell you, I used to be with a mining outfit on Callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
Can you patch me a temporary loop on DCMGS?
Where is she?
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
Whoa, wait a minute...
What's wrong?
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display.
That's what we thought.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Sorry.  Two green enabling buttons...
Okay, we're in business.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
How's it going?
You should hit the sack, too.
'Bout five minutes.
Hello, there. Who are you?
I think the time has come for you to shed some of your humility. It is just as false not to blow your horn at all as it is to blow it too loudly...
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
A fine old theater, the Shubert. Full of tradition, untouched by the earthquake - so sorry - fire... by the way, what was your husband's name?
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
Are you that sure of tomorrow?
Aren't you?
All paved with diamonds and gold?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
You have no right to say such things!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Not with me, you're no champion. You're stepping way up in class.
You're too short for that gesture. Besides, it went out with Mrs. Fiske.
She did like you, she helped and trusted you! You paid her back by trying to take Bill away!
Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
What makes a man walk into a lion cage with nothing but a chair?
From the smartness of your dress, I take it your luncheon companion is a lady?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
Nothing?
Thank you so much.
The lack of pretense, that sort of strange directness and understanding-
I understand they've got the Indians pretty well in hand...
Huh?
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
How is Eve? Okay?
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I can't believe you're making this up - it sounds like something out of an old Clyde Fitch play...
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
Don't mix your metaphors.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
I am sick and tired of these paranoiac outbursts!
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
The so-called art of acting is not one for which I have a particularly high regard...
You know what I'm going to be?
I just wondered.
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
I think we'd like very much. Sure you won't mind?
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Why not?
She's loyal and efficient-
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
I might.
That's the door.
You're not going, are you?
Not just that way. As a friend...
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
You won't forget it?
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
No, thank you.  Yes. I've seen every performance.
I've got it.
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
How far to the station?
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
When you asked a minute ago it was five-forty-two. It is now five forty-three. When you ask a minute from no, it will be-
Where'd you get all that information?
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
That bitter cynicism of yours is something you've acquired since you left Radcliffe!
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet them at the Cub Room tonight, after theater. For a bottle of wine.
Darling, I didn't promise Eve anything. Just said I thought she'd be fine for the part, but there were some practical difficulties...
Such as?
- well? What happened?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
I'm sure.
I have no intention of having an accident!
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
"Liebestraum."
No. You're just crazy about "Liebestraum."
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Are you breaking the contract?
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
--no way--
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
--I'm not interested in theory. What do we know? For example, Hunt's disappeared.
Hmm.
--a spy, you mean?
--has he got an ax?--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
The burglary was done by Cubans or Democrats or Republicans.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
Hmm?
--according to sources involved in the Watergate investigation. Beginning in the spring of 1971--
--what time is it?
Look, you've been jerking my chain all day. If there's some reason you can't talk to me--like the fact that you've already leaked everything to The New York Times--just say so.
I'll never get out of here in time.
--Howard Hunt?
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
And you will.  But not now.
I called him from Washington. He's the one who asked me to be here at eleven in the morning.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
--and we got a guy in Justice--
What's a real denial?
Where are your bills, Carl?
Hey... very tense.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
You don't believe me? Well, I was working the weekend of the break-in and my God, all the executives were running around like crazy--you had to practically wait in line to use the shredding machine--and when the FBI came to investigate, they never even asked me about it.
If you don't like it down there, why don't you quit?
One minute but then--
Which people?
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere.  ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
I will not talk about the other two.
Right.
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
Just tell me his title.
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
What I don't understand is how you got here.
They are not my clients.
Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
My turn to keep you waiting.  What's the topic for tonight?
Talk about Segretti--
There were more then.
Hello, I'm Bob Woodward of the Washing Post and...  Mullen and Company Public Relations? Could you tell me when you expect Mr. Hunt?  He is?
--well, I've got some pretty experienced fellas sitting around, wouldn't you say so?--
...go on, go on...
I did all right on McCord.
You can't believe that.
--remember Toronto, Harry.
--has any of them got an ax?--
More denunciations?
Haldeman.  Right?
No, I'm a reporter. I wanted to talk to you about the Committee to Re- Elect.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
Thanks coach.
Perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
Good morning gentleman.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Of course, Finch.  What?
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
That's nice.
What?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
Oz, it's okay, I know.
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
I think I've had one.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
Do you?
Right.  That gives us...
No -- it's true.  He is...really... big.
Went home to shit.
But, but -- what would I do?
Jim?
Dad, please stop.  Please.  I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Sure you know, son, but I think you've been having a little problem with it. It's okay, though.  What you're doing is perfectly normal.  It's like practice.  Like when you play tennis against a wall.  Some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  You do want a partner, don't you son?
Son.  This lady's here for you.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
She's a mermaid, dude.
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Who cares?
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
No...you...go...ahead.
Uh...
Nadia, I can't --
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
"Dear Ms. Hughes.  We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
Vicky, wait.
I know, Vick.  I'm just not ready yet, okay?
Now?!
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Yeah Vick?
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Just dial 976-Asshole.
Ready for what?
I'm such a loser.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky.  Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  This is just wrong.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
NOVA!!
Also like sex with my wife.
Either way works for us...
Actually, I'm waiting for someone.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Who gives a shit? I've had it up to here with arrogant Frenchmen.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Serafine...
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
I know where he'll go.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
Psychic awareness. Right.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Not you too -
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Andy? Andy is that you?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
Where is it! Please!
Why would he pick this one?
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Enough. Cut him loose.
I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
Saint Severin...
Hurry, Grandmama!
Ouch!  That really hurt!
I have my reasons.
I'm going to stretch my legs
Come on up!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
It's the best fork of all
Yeah ... well, yours. You still don't believe that you're the Princess, do you?
I'm so scared...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Don't let me go!
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
I gave you that tongue and I can rip it out!
How do you know?
What was that?
He's her?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
What do you mean?
Please, if you'd just listen...
Singer!
Who are you?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Yes.
Lyndon Johnson?
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
Well, no... not just, not only.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Nice car.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century.  Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
Oh, thank you.
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
Yeah!
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah?
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a...  ...rapidly growing field.
Mine.
How is it any different?
Well, have you ever made love high?
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Were you always funny?
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
Yeah.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Who cares? Who cares?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
and I keep, you know, it's-
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Will it change your wife?
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What's- It's me, open up.
What?
It's for my complexion.
Yeah?
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Oh-
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
You look very pretty.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
What'd I do?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Commentary.
Oh, I'm sorry!
My head is throbbing.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Yeah.
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Like all that Juliet of the Spirits or Satyricon, I found it incredibly... indulgent. You know, he really is. He's one of the most indulgent film makers. He really is-
Oh.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh.
Max, I've got a hit series.
You wanna lie down?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Let 'im drop dead! Who needs his business?!
She was going through my pocketbook!
Dennis-right, uh, uh... local kid probably, would meetcha in front of the movie house on Saturday night.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
I look pretty.
Oh, he's adorable, Annie.
...of possibly working together.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Absolutely not.
Isn't Skye amazing?
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Who, Sally?
And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death.
Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Honey?
Oh.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
I'll change back before we leave.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
When does he graduate high school?
Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold.
In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry.
Let me.  I'm Jeffrey.
Oh.  You're them.
We've heard lots about you.
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Damn near.  And a damn near perfect drug.
Not as a rule.
Hey!  Would you?
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here.
Yes.
Did he promise?
Just do what I say, alright?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Hardly...
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Still champions.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
You walked out on a five year marriage.
It's not like this all the time.
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Don't push me away.
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
I know.  It's for the baby's crib.
I know.
Sure.
Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne?
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find?
The infamous dog?
I meant Sally.
You're an interior decorator, right?
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
Scout's honor.
I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
It's really not the same thing.  He was really nicer when he drank.
How long have you been married?
Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
I don't need a drug.
You're not serious.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Excuse me?
Don't go in, Ryan.
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Yeah.
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Like your business managers?
No.  Really.  For real.  Really.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?
Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.  And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said.  And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Thanks.
You don't need to thank me.
Yes.
Well, I don't trust her.  I never have.
Well good.  Thank God.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
General -- we have to talk sometime!
Why should everyone dance the same way?  It's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
Oh, that's okay, I'll let him off this time.  Are you crazy?  This guy's built like a pebble!  You know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Theoretically, yes.  But is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
This lake is huge!  And so close to the colony!  Think of the vacation potential!
Face it, Z, we're lost!  We must have walked halfway across the world by now!  How did I get into this mess...
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
Of course --
No -- we're going to attack the termites!
I wonder...what...was it all...for...
Fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
Scattered reports, sir.  Rumors. Nothing reliable.
Now I've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  Well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  But in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Damn, I'm proud of you, boy.  I wish I had a hundred ants of your caliber. The world would tremble.  Now, time for some R and R.  You're invited to the royal victory party!
May I cut in?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
Look, General!  A darling baby soldier!  Don't try to be a hero!  Just make sure you come back in one piece!  Next!
Time to cut a rug, Z!
So this is your mother's apartment?
You must eat -- and you must get healthy -- and you must forget him. Such a fine boy he seemed when he first moved in here -- clean and cut -- a regular Ivy Leaguer. Turns out he is King Farouk. Mit the drinking -- mit the cha cha -- mit the no napkins. A girl like you, for the rest of your life you want to cry in your noodle soup? Who needs it! You listen to me, you find yourself a nice, substantial man -- a widower maybe -- and settle down -- instead of nashing all those sleeping pills -- for what, for whom? -- for some Good Time Charlie?  Sssh!
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
I hope everything goes all right.
I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Oh -- Miss Kubelik.  I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Sure.
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Marry Christmas.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I think so.
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I'm not very good at it.
Too slow?
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Sure.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Who'd care?
I would.
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
Are you supposed to?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
No -- just come as you are.
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Fine. How's your eye?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See?  Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Oh.
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place.  What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Don't mind what?
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
You?
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
Aren't you?
Well, I have things to do --
What's this -- you packing?
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
Can I ask you a personal question?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Hi. How's the branch manager from Kansas City?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's right.
How long has it been -- a month?
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
You're not being funny.
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice  -- about the best way to handle it --
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
Coming?
The nerve.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
What gives?
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
You came in on that boat, didn't you?
Yeah.
We could use some fuel -- just a half drum -- just enough to get us out a here.
My men --
We have a lot of pride in our unit --
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
Delta ?
A year ? Waiter another beer.
He was working A.R.V.N. patrols and had one a them little cocky gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow, the Lieutenant took his new Playboy one day, sat on the end of the dock, and wouldn't give it back.
Arch light.
Yes, sir --
Whatdoya think it thinks.
'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down.
Forget that extra drum -- it's too damn hot.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Terminate ?
Charlie?
What -- happened here.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
About what ?
As I said, we can pay you in gold.
It is very good -- there is no current -- It is very good. I have never seen one like it in all Indochina. I was in Paris when it arrived -- do you know what might have caused --
You'll get blown outta here some day.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions.
They far enough?
What?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
Can you trust them?
You'll find enough Cong up there.
No -- no, sir.
Pain is easy to handle -- but nobility.. the nobility of a man is judged by how much Truth he can handle.
I had immense plans.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
Yes, I know...
You hear it again?
No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back.
The other one --
What?
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
So Kurtz is alive.
Why didn't he shoot you?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
I know.
Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be?
First you save my ass, now you want to kill me.  Make up your goddamn mind.
215  CONTINUED:
She's dead.
I don't want to talk any more.
Thanks.
Oh, sweetheart.  It's beautiful!
You were looking at it in the catalog.  Don't know where you can wear it...
What's going on?
When you ran off, I thought you'd keep going 'til you were back home in Washington.
Let's keep going.  We're only an hour from Devil's Cauldron.
Desmond.
Does he have people?
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We've got another two hours of daylight.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
Folks come to Alaska for a real short list of reasons:  Money. Adventure.  Solitude.  Those cover most everyone.  But frontiers also draw another type of man.  One with a demon in his gut.  He comes to the edge of the world to face that demon, and lay it to rest.
Stay still.
Emergency transmitter?  All your gear is back at Wilder's.
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.
Shut up!
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
What are you talking about?
What does this matter to you?
Fuck you.
...You give us a ride in the Cessna you got hangared at the pumping station, we'll be in Fairbanks in a few hours.
Get the fuck out of here.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
No.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
I'm starving.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
I'm hungry.  You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Uh, Udall?
Carol the waitress?
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Note. Put it in the note.
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
You waiting for me to say something?  What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
You take off when you have to.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Nonsense!
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
Sure -- take him to the vet.
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
What?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
No, I didn't.
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
Where are all your queer party friends?
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
I carry bacon in my pocket.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
You consider your life easy.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
Absolutely not.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
Bain.  Michael Bain.
What?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Michael?
Who is the mark?
I have been sitting on a contract from Cleveland for six days because of you.
I bet you fucking know!
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!
Took a guess.  Lucky for you, I guessed right.
You want me to pump?
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
'Them'?
An assassin?
Yes.
The nature of the business.  You remove your competition.
Yes.
Oh Jesus Jesus...
Rath.  Robert Rath.
Because I'm done.
The same way everyone does; the government, the Agency.
How old were you?
Women?  No... not really.
Are they usually like that?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Thinking.
About?
I don't know.
Do you think about the game?
Do you think he's here?
Okay.
I paid a lot for these.
Okay.  Then what?
Why won't he wait until the bank closes?
And with the mikes, I'll tell you when he leaves the hotel and you'll tell me when he leaves the bank.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
What did he want?
Was that it?
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
I didn't notice them.
No?
Yes.
Who was she?
What happened to her?
I'm not normal.
What?
Electra --
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you believe that?
I have been thinking about this for a long while.  I knew this day was coming.  I knew someday someone would make the call on me. I never thought about anyone that I had whacked.  What do you call it anyway?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
That's true Doug, writers are supposed to write.
You guys having a go a me or what?
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Fifteen crowns.
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
No, I got nothing till Tuesday.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Yep, except a name for this place.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
I'd love to get in there.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Why, how in the hell are we going to set up a cafe?
Need any disks?
Like helping a sick kid?
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
No beer?
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
My God! What happened?
Holly!
What?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
So?
Yeah, somewhere?
Take this exit.
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
Good morning.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Doug, haven't seen you for a while.
So why don't you get up and speak something, then we will see who is crazy.
What?
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
Everybody is at home, it's no good.
She's tired.
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
Sure, I've done it easily.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
Sure, they are students.
They'll do it.
Okay?
It is okay........We will paint the wood black, yes?
Tomorrow, we will bring some lights and also hang some fabric. I think it will be finished in the morning.
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
Am I invited?
We don't need you.
We_re not all running away
No, just a coffee.
Weren't you going to get some glasses?
It's Josh's.
This is your doing?
A kind of freedom.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
No, just a drill.
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Shall I look after the rest?
Very well.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
That's over. Way over.
He wants to show now.
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
To see your father?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
Landon!
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
I know you don't want help.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Looking for intelligent life?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
What?
You're acting like a crazy person.
What do you actually know with religion?
What's wr--?
What would you do up here?
You planned this --
No.
Pull over.
Are you frightened?
But if you could, you would?
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
So talk to us about something.
Yes. You?
You're marrying again.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
Where did you get -- ?
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
Scalene?
This... is the number one single?
Dick, what's with those guys out there in the gutter? 
What's N.R.C.?
How was school today?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
He comes out of the cafeteria line, he's nervous, he spills his corn, and he asks you to the dance!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
I'm usually nervous myself on first dates...but not tonight. It's funny, but somehow, I feel like....like I know you.
Well, Eileen...jeez, that's hard for me to say. Have you ever been in a situation where -- well -- you know you have to act a certain way, but when you get there, you don't know if you can go through with it?
Dad, you seen the drill?
You've gotta ask her to the dance!
Well... yeah...
I'm going to be at the dance.
Why?
Maybe if I used my left....
What?
Good evening, one said. Agents Reese   and Foley, from the Nuclear Regulatory Commition.  Mind stepping over here?
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
All I know is you're throwing away an awful lot of money.
The future, Marty, the future is everything! I built this machine to see the future. So I am going to send Shemp twenty-four hours into the future. You can assist me, if you like.
Well, there's a mall here now -- I mean, there will be.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
I know.
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Perfect...
What do you call this? 
Well, he's gone.
Oh yeah?
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
What you been doing?
What do you feed him?
We did it, Ray.
Then why'd you do it?
What'd you come out here for?
What for?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
Well, stop the world.
Quit my job.
Great.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
You know what I think?
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Are you sure?
Is he upset?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
I don't know.
I don't blame him.
Everybody loves trout.
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
Who are you?
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
What?
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.
Got a half a tuna sandwich.
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
Pull up!  We did it!  Holy shit, we did it!  Pull up!
Where're you goin'?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's your name?
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
Any sign of Buckaroo?
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Hello, Barton.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
I want to know!
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks  well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
Chet!
I write.
I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, and from there I'll... improvise.
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
...Look, you're confused? You need guidance? Talk to another writer.
Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.
Like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos breed in swamps  this is a desert town. Wuddya got for me?
Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Doesn't surprise me at all.
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
And I could tell you some stories 
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Hi, Charlie.
Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
How did you know about that?
...Your room does that too?
Yeah.
I don't know!  Maybe it was her... boyfriend. I passed out. I don't know.  Won't the police be able to 
Yeah... rye whiskey?
I apologize, Barton.
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider 
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You live in 605?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. But I'll be frank with you: That is not helpful.
He teach you to do it?
...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. Talking about the Wallace Beery picture.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
So -- how are things?
We were in some of the same classes.
No, Nick, please --
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
What was she like in school?
What did she tell me, Beth?
Were you with him last night?
I told you -- I quit.
What's your new book about?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
I like you.
How about Roxy?  Is she a fuck to the century, too?
It's OK.  It's OK.
You won't believe me.
What did he say?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Did you miss me?
Somebody has to die.
Why?
How's that?
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
Thanks.
What you doin', son?
Was she ever suspect?
You... fucked her!  Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Where the hell you goin'?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Were you with him last night?
How the fuck do you know?  What is it with you and this broad anyway?
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
I told you to stay away from Tramell.
On what basis?
Who are you?
He died -- about five or six years ago.
Hey  it's the big A.M..
When's your show?
What do you think?
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
That was my favorite part!
I don't even have any friends anymore besides you. And everyone says "Warhol? That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
Is Jean Michel here?
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
What do you mean?
I need a dealer.
I'm here.
Leeches. A long list of leeches.  It looks good like that.
I'm not black.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve  I mean Shenge.
Your people.
I ain't John Henry.
Can I walk you home?
I thought you hated this place?
It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
How is he?
What's your name, man?
Hi.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
Some of them.
How can I ever thank you?
Wanna Mac?
No, I'd like the scarf.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
So what?
OK! Goodbye!
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
Which is why I hoped you'd snub him.
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
Wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. But explain me ... If you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Sorry.  I mistook me for somebody else.
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
It's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  Sickos never scare me.  At least they're commited.
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
You're coming with me, you Great White Dope!  To die, way down in the sewer!
Not Chip!  Please!  Penguin ... If you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
... Where did curiosity get the cat?
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
Too late for what, dear child?
I must have dozed off.  My sincerest apologies, sir.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
I love you, old man.
Alfred, old friend, I could use your help right now.
It's good to see you.
Advanced botany.  DNA splicing. Recombinant animal plant patterns. Pheromone extractions.
Hey, I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.  Personally.  Me.  I did.
Keep it.
What are you talking about?
This is easy.
I'm afraid to ask.
Nice suit.  And today you are?
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
I'm totally over her.  Positively.
What are you talking about?
Dr. Pamela Isley.
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.
That's gotta hurt.
Let me get this straight. A brilliant citizen, disfigured by a horrible accident, re-emerges as a psychotic super-villain bent on theft, revenge and destruction. You see a pattern here?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
McGregor's Syndrome.  That's what Freeze's wife had.
Like hell you do.
Dick, don't push me right now.
And she did it all for me.  For love.
She wants to kill you.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
I love that belt.  What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
Yes.  I shall replay the world for sentencing me to a life without the warmth of human comfort.  I will blanket the city in endless winter. First Gotham and then the world.
I find that unlikely.
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.
What do you mean?
Dr. Isley?  Pamela?  You look great. Especially for a dead woman.
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
Your parents' wake. Rain fell like tears.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
All the answers are numbers.
I'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
I notice you've sub-divided your B coupons. Feeling a little light on principle?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
He sure did.
Find anything interesting?
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
If I didn't know better, I'd say you were sulking.
Keep me off the couch, Doc. Your fees are a little rich for me.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
What are you talking about?
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
Me and my brother Chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. Dad's knee was going. Chris was engaged, you know that? Two-Face took...everything. Now I can pay him back.
Dr. Burton tells me you know who Batman is.
I'll show you it works.
No.  Wait...
Oh my God. Jim Morrison was right.
About what?
What are you talking about?
How'd you find this place?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki.
See, I don't know how it happened... she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she's in love with you.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... I wish you'd reconsider.
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
All right, Bruce, what do you suggest?
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
I understand.
It's me.  "Sugar Bumps."
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Yum, yum.
Peanuts?
Plain or roasted?  Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
It's the last thing we need.
Scottish.
Oh yes.
And howls Alison?
Say that again, son.
Ah, David.  Finally.  And this must be our professor from across the sea.
I think you're wrong, David.  She looks as fine as she's ever looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
Of course.
What makes you say that?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
... in the distant future.
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
It is urgent, sir.
Nope.
Come on Sting!
No it wasn't!
Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
So, like, where is she?
That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows about fire! Change the channel.
That was boring. Huh huh.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?
Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
Huh? Huh huh.
Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt cheeks, huh huh huh.
Well where is she?!
You already said that, Butt-Head.
I'm probably going to make out with her first before we, you know, get down...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Well, Earl said you guys were young, but jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get the job done. So what are your names?
Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't as sweet as she looks. She stole everything from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
Uh, ten uh...
You'll be rich!
We're rich in what really matters.
Manchurian Tung oil?  Where did you get it?
You saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
Two hours.
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you, I really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
You can't say that for sure.  It could be a transitional thing. Like a post-life crisis.  We just have to be tougher with them. Come on.  Have some brandy. Spirits, get it?
Look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
She couldn't have.  We can't <u>make</u> them see us.
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh, Adam.
Honey, I think that was a mistake.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
What?
Why are you creeping around Delia's bedroom?
Aren't you dead?
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
Are you available?
Just get some people out of our house.
Are you Juno, our case worker?
We're very unhappy.
He's a freelance bio-exorcist. Claims to get rid of the living. But he's a troublemaker.  He's pushy.  He's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
Tell the truth.
So, <u>never</u> let Beetle Juice out. Never.  Besides...  We're thinking about letting everyone stay... You and your father and mother can stay too.
How'd you do on the science test?
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Where'd they go?
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
At least insofar as we have our first casualty.  Me.
... sheets.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
Not <u>a building</u>!  That's the beauty of it.  I think I can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  These people don't know the value of their property!
Okay?
Otho, I can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
Attic space.
Are they still here, Otho?
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hellooo!  How's school?
Perhaps if I were properly motivated.
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
Oh, fine.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
It's fine today, Robert.
I would like to walk today.
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
... Eve - this has been an exhausting day for Ben...
... He walked off...
... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
Do you know Raphael?
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
I would like to watch television.
May I ask your name?
Yes.
He does...?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
Chauncey...
That's good. I like to watch, too.
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
No, Eve. I don't read the papers.
Yes.
No. I was with a man. We went upstairs.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes. It's very tiny, but it's good.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
I feel very good in here.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
I want to tell Eve.
Your appearance doesn't suggest that at all, Mr. Chance.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
Can you walk? It's not broken, is it?
Does it have a television?
I see.
Yes... Of course, you know, Mr. Gardiner, that I always prefer an open and frank conversation with my guests, I hope you don't object to that.
Don't we need a leader capable of guiding us through the seasons? The bad as well as the good?
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
... How long have you been living here?
Compensated...?
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
I have no claim, Thomas.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
... Ben, really...
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
No, that won't do any good.
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Yeah... He and my father used to ride together back in the thirties... Fox hunting... Before I was born...
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
Big business. I could work with that faction quite nicely, Colonel Novogrod.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
We have to make it an early night.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I was worried.
The iguana.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
How was it?
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
We?
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
You fell in love with her first.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
I need a shower.
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
A better friend.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Maxine...
Pardon?
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Security.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
No. I understand perfectly.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
You're insane.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
That's the usual?
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I've fallen in love.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
Must you take this terrible demon on yourself, my love?
No.
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
No, for God's sake, I just watered it yesterday.  It almost went well. I gave a pretty good dream, but circumstances arose.
But I think I have another plan.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Do you?
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda. Were you stoned?
You're crazy to let go of a chick who calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a friend.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
She's not available.
A friendly competition, if you will. Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S. Truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. Not some Vegas Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. The audience decides who is more deserving of the title. The losing puppeteer bows out graciously. Goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Can I get you a drink?
Do you mind?
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
I likes yellow.
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
No. Sorry.
You don't sit with me!!
Baby, don't be like that.
Don't talk like that. Your mama loves you.
Yes?
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Oh.
Well, what can you do?
Could be that fall you took.
MAMA!
She likes this dress...
He's sleeping in the church.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
You know he's colored? What else there to know?
You was friends.
That's so.
You mind loaded with spirits. Everywhere you look you see one.
For what?
Never found out.
You don't know what I think.
She was only-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Here's the money, and the phone. Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.
Her life is in your hands.
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that: Her life is in your hands.
Shit.
Where'd she been?
I know my rights.
What are you, some kind of sad-assed refugee from the fucking sixties?
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you from his garden party, that you were drunk and abusive.
The Gundersons.
What do you mean, Dude?
Where you going, Dude?
I'm going home, Donny.
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
Different mothers, huh?
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one more?
Heh-heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Ahh, not so good, man.
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I gotta get back.
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?
Oh, no.
I'm getting to your rug. My  father and I don't get along; he doesn't approve of my lifestyle and, needless to say, I don't approve of his. Still, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter, so I'm proposing that you try to recover the money from the people you delivered it to.
That's really thoughtful but I--
I'm telling you, I got definitive evidence--
So Dieter has the money?
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
Am I wrong!
Come on Walter, it's just--it's Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a little, it's just a game.
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
That...fucking...bitch!
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
...Huh?
Huh?
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I tell Lebowski?
Walter--
But Walter--
Well that's just, that's the stress talking, Dude.  So far we have what looks to me like a series of victimless crimes--
Uh-huh.
Not exactly a lightweight.
No.
Is this your homework, Larry?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
Dude?
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, there never was any money.  The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, man, so take it up with him.
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!
There weren't any shots.
Wha. . . Donny--
Walter--
What about that shit about Vietnam!
Dude, I'm sorry--
Another Caucasian, Gary.
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my--
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light of my life.  Are you surprised at my tears, sir?
WHAT?!
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
Shit, sorry man.
Smokey Huh?
We'll take 'em in the morning.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
What?
This is our world you're entering.  You may see things -- feeding.  Just remember why you're here.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Gonna try and OD Whistler on a retroviral cure.
Motion sensors.  Looks like Zone Three.
He was here.  Watching us.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
No --  Does that mean I can't be a donor?
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
So how long have you known Blade, anyway?
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
Who is LaMagra?
It worked, didn't it?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
Just get out of here.
Some. It's been slow --
I know. Take some of my blood.
How could you be a part of this?
Tell me something, honestly, you ever have second thoughts about us?
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
But you use blood banks --
Why do you hunt them?
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
What do you mean?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
No!
Oh, sorry, right.
--the witch kills children--
Jesus.
What?
--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there <u>was</u> a Blair Witch--
The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
You know, Nick, you've been something of a total asshole the past few days.
Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.
Why is there no "our" here?
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
Are you marked like this??
I know, I know.
You want a hand?
Can you zoom it or something, make it real close, real big?
The witch?
I don't believe this.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
What I never could figure about the movie?
Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.
Yeah?
Mi casa y su casa!
Where <u>is</u> it?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
What the fuck--??
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
For "James?"
--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
What?
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
What're you doing?
Spite.
--whatever you want, no problem--
Enough to keep sane.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is <u>I'm</u> not dealing with something--<u>anything</u>-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
You planning on sleeping out there?
Elly Kedward?
--I know!
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
No. We <u>all</u> go.
....Ma'am?
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
Well... the couch would be all right...
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Uh-huh.
Abby... you all right?
...Who?
...What's going on with you two?
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
...Friday?
...He gave me a little pearl-handled .38 for out first anniversary.
...Well, if the pay's right and it's legal I'll do it.
If the pay's right I'll do it.
...Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
Ya catch any fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.
...I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.
Deuce in the corner needs help.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Got a problem, Meurice?
Frank. Come in.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Pest control. gotta do your apartment.
Nope. it's new stuff. no smell.
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
I wanted to see you.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Don't say that.
. I. uh.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.
Who is Don?
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I'm sorry .maybe I better go Dorothy.
No. how could he?. Don't go. You think I'm crazy, don't you? I want you to stay.  . don't hate me.
Are you a bad boy?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Come on Dorothy.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
There's no disease, I can tell you.
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
Hold me, Don.
I promise, Dorothy. I promise.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Hey? . You like to walk.
What?
There ya go.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Alright, now tell me. What is it?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
You really want to do this, don't you?
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
Oh, okay. can I call?
Yeah. I mean. a little, . you know.
That doesn't bother you, does it?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
Can I give you a kiss good night?
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
You want to dance?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
He comes over to study.
Sure thing. please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
Greetings, Mr. George.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
No.  I have the space.  I figured it out.  This is what I want to do.
Are you kidding?
What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not a chance.  So, what's the verdict?
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
What the fuck is that?
I don't think so.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
What?
Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to know my crime?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.
In my country, I am a magico.  A man with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To take nothing and make it something, okay?  I have failed my dream, but I will accomplish.  That is why I am in your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom. But they do not take my dream.  Do you have a dream, George?
George.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
Touche.
Three million.  I counted it twice.
Are you comfortable with this?
Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be here any minute.  I'm trying to concentrate.
What do you need my connection for, Diego?  What are you going to do with it?
Derek Foreal.
Well, you know.  It's um...
Who's the cheapskate?
Yes, it is.
It's beautiful.
Keep them coming.
Life will take care of everybody. Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
You mad at me?
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
You're like your mother.  You love money.
You're not going to trial?
Give this to Mom, will you?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
And that FBI agent, Trout?  When he had to get on his knees to put my boots on? You said...
Figured it out.
Source?  What about Derek?
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Is she here?  George, Kristina hates you.  You fucked her over one too many times.  And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Well, here I am.  See?
You mean, like a trip?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
Shhhh.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how much will you be needing?
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
Second district ...
What's happened to you?
They're not paying me anything. They've already warned you twice; this is the last warning. Decide.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
Of course. As soon as possible.
Read it.
With the others. They are trying to stop the people.
It's good nobody is following us ...
No ...
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - -  I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me.  I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
You did a good job, Charlie.
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
An inquiry into what?
Very poor.  He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
No.
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh's maid for nine years?
Like cats and dogs.
No -- never.
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I've got work to do.
I have.
Were you aware of Mr. Marsh's heart condition?
A little after eleven.
Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?
Her name?
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh to your office?
I know this is a very personal subject, but could you be a little more specific?
It was wild.  She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things.  I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
Can you give the court an example?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
I couldn't help myself.  You get lost inside a women like her.  It was like a drug.  It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Yes -- several times.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Yes.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
No.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
What did he say?
What happened next?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along.  Isn't that true?
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
How?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
That's not an answer.
It's not my taste.
Yes -- it would be nice.
You were brilliant today.
I'm dropping the case.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
Can't it wait?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
What's she like?
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Lawyer here?
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Then why do you?
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Oh. When did you move back?
How long you been married?
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Oh there you are.
Where are you staying while you're here?
Much.
No. I'll do them later.
Are you all right?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Why doesn't it scare you?
No, I'm just saying --
My mistake. I apologize.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
No. I was just... No.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
How about if I set the table?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
How about Bari?
What were you like when you were younger?
Uh-huh. And?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
No. Don't do this.
Later. Go back to sleep.
Again? Maybe you should see a doctor.
He yours, sir?
Bones!  How baddass is zat?  This is the place for us.  Patrick, you get platinum props, man.  Platinum.
What's your problem with Crippled Dick?
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
You soundin' like the old man now.
I believe in you guys.  You are the real shit.  And you know it.  Now I'm putting everything I got into this cuz I think we can make it happen, but you gotta put a little in too.  Now all I"m asking is that everybody do their part.  We'll move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
Yeah, we can.  Least till after this weekend.  He ain't going nowhere.  We'll deal with it then.
You sure got a way with women, bro.  What happened up there?
But a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
I want you to do something for me, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
But if it's him.  If he's really come back, won't he know us?  Love us?
Patrick, he's...
Here, find my hand.  The stairs are right near here.  I saw them.  Let's just walk up there.
We gotta jump!
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
You were just a kid.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
What the hell do you want?
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
What building?
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
That building?
The next one blows off your dick.
Caesar!
Jesus, Caesar!
There's no time.
Caesar, this is crazy.
We're going to need some time.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I should have let him kill you.
Another time.
Where is it?
You can't kill me yet.
What?  They ain't there?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Oh, I'm sorry --
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
No, no trouble.  There's other work to do.
He said you lost something.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky?
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you.
I had to see you.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
...  I needed that.
No.
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
I'm glad you did.
What's wrong?
I don't understand - ?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
You mean Shelly?
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Even though he knew about you?
What choice?
How much money?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
Yeah.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
They're putting together an agency oversight committee.  They're going to look through everyone's budgets. Treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  What am I going to do about that?
Pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
We've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. We've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  We just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I'd rethink that.
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
I'm going to Paris.
I work alone.  Like you...  ...we always work alone.
What do you mean?
Are you Treadstone?
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
<u>Was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
You're a U.S. Citizen?
<u>Do you have your passport, sir</u>?
Yes.  Is he there?
...I understand...
It's very bad this.  Terrible sad. Such a young man.
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
We also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  Our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
I want to go home.
Okay.  Twenty thousand.  Ten now.  Ten there.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.
That's what I'm saying.
When you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
Thanks for the ride.
-- where does this come from? --  How do you have my picture?
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
No.
I didn't know this would happen.
What is that?
xxxxxx
What was I thinking, right?
I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?
Wait a minute --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
What do they have on the streets? The area.  They must have something.
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
How did I get here?
... fix themselves.
You're putting your talents to very odd use Mr Lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against Central Services -
I think you've got your T41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. It's either that or a new washer.
What? How do you know my name?
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
Layton.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
I assure you, Sam, I'm doing everything within my power. But the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
Jack!
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Even later.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Ah ...
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
I've got numbers all over these - I'm not sure which is the one you want.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
There's no procedure for that until she's been arrested.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack?... Jack?
Where do I get it stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
You think these are tits don't you?
Are you alright?
Don't look back! Act naturally!
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Why not?
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
What?
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Oh God! What have we done?
Please, Jill ... I love you.
Don't do anything silly.
What do you think? ... is it me?
The refund for Tuttle!
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
That's it.
Can I forget it?
I know that.
I won't be held responsible.
How long will she he away?
Numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise. 
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
It seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. He thinks you should see a doctor.
This is an emergency!
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
what? ... Oh ... 
Tuttle! Are you from Central Services?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
You know each other a long time?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
Hey Cy, guess who's here?
They're gonna torch the fence. You're gonna feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
Noel, you didn't let me finish. We have rules against killing people on the street. Looks bad, but there's a special room at the hospital for terminating. A nice quiet room with a big bed.
Do you have any music?
Is he going to be alright?
Our Lady of Misery.
Hello, I'm Frank Pierce, from the ambulance last night. I brought your father into the hospital and I just learned some news.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
I'll drink to that.
Where you going?
He got better.
Who knows? It's all lower-brain-stem- activity. The heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. This guy's a fighter. Every time the Valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
Whatja doing?
Whadda we bring?
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
I don't know--let's break some windows.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
No we can't. He's got a pulse.
Tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
You want to go out there --  get out of this for a second?
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
No.  No.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late.  Sorry.
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
London.
You know what I...
I thought she'd be here.  I'll go with you.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
I don't like the word gay.
A half hour in the lobby.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Nine seconds.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Jesus, Jane.  How long have you been here?
Then it went well.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I think you're the Devil.
Let's go...
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
I saw the smile -- good piece.
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it.  I think it could turn them around.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.
What did he say?
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
No...no.
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Is everything all right?
Oh.
I'll speak to you.
I got my report card.  Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight.  More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
So great -- right?
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
I've got another story.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you?  Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
I didn't think you'd make it.
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
You okay?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
I know.  I taped it.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Yes.  Then he said a really weird thing...
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
I got promoted for things like that.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day.  Okay, I'll go first.  I haven't...
Don't you work here?
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
Are you nervous, Walter?
I already told you I'm not.
Alright we're clear.
Look at the size of it!
It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand...
Like it?  It's a masterpiece.  I've never seen anything like it before... and I hope I never see anything like it again. Walter smiles and looks at his creation -
I came over to see you.  I brought something...I wanted to show you.
Walter!  Jeez!
Goodbye.
Nice night out...
Of course I do!
Walter, I'm sorry...
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man look at that get up !
No, it's Ok...you came in early.  Besides, you're creating an incident. When people are applauding they don't order anything.
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
It's hot in here...
What do you have in the box?
You're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
I'm not looking to pinch you!  I don't care about you, or the girl.  But you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what I want to hear.  Now!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the RTD of -
And what project looms on the horizon, Walter?
A hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  I want to be warmed by it.
Well, I'll go home with you.
Don't tell me I didn't hear a racket!  I'm an older woman and I don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
I don't know.  But the boy, he couldn't kill them.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Suck!
It's coffee.
You think?  Split?
No offense, man, but I think you're on something nasty.  Why don't you just go and cool out and I'll see you in the morning or something.
Wheels?
Excellent.
Buffy, honey?
Maybe.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Nothing.
I do?  I guess I do.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
So that's your tutor, huh?  What is he, like, your boyfriend now?
I don't understand.
Can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
Do you do this kind of thing a lot? I mean, is this like a hobby?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Thanks.
Dress, huh?  What for?
I'm going to the dance.
In order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. Comprende?
I don't want to kill anybody, and I don't want to talk about it anymore.
I'm glad you came.
Buffy, what is your sitch?  You're acting like The Thing From Another Tax-Bracket; it's too weird.
This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Yeah, whoops I came.
You look way pretty, Kim.
Am I in trouble or something?
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
Wait!
Does Elvis talk to you?  Tell you to do things?  Do you see spots?
Everybody does.
I don't know.  It was...  There was a big gram or something.  And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
How do you know all this?
Where's the other one?
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Cheerleading.  For... sporting events, yes?
Who we gonna beat?
No.  You don't do anything.  I do it.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
All right.  You've heard of the emperor Caligula, perhaps?  Or Jack the Ripper?
What!?!
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Oh, wonderful.  My secret weapon is - PMS.  That's just great.  Thanks for telling me.
Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
Thank you very much.
Nicole...
So very much.
Hi, Grueller.
Listen, you little worm.  I could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like I did last year, you got that?  You got that?
Wit-tay.
Oh, God.
God!  Take a chill lozenge.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
God, I never thought of that.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
How was that?
How ya like that?
Get over here.
No.
He didn't mean it nasty.  He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
I'd like you to meet my father.
It's Skip, for you.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
I don't dance.
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout.  Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting.  But you shouldn't think about it too much.  The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
Damn.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Why baseball?
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
It was a cocksucking call!
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
Drive off your back leg.  You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Fastball.
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already.  A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
Naw...
What do I gotta do?
Jesus.
I'm trying to thank you.
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
And where can I go?
Ain't he warning up?
He walked eighteen?!
Struck out eighteen...
--we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.   He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
We're eight and sixteen.
What'you want, kid?
Thank you.
What?
Was I at that dinner?
He even played golf with the President.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
Excuse me.
Hey!
Yeah.
So, l-l-l-listen, I te- I te- I tell you - can I call you back in a few minutes?
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
Mommy.
Somethin', huh?
Yeah.
And I didn't want any of those agents near my place.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.'  Do you believe this shit?
Where's my head? Where's your fuckin' balls? Huh? You know I'm tryin' to put somethin' really big together out here. You know what I'm talkin' about, huh? You know!  If you're actin' like this now, how can I depend on you?  There's a lot of things gonna change out here. And if you wanna be there with me, Sammy, you're gonna have to go my fuckin' way.
You should say so.
You lost your control.
All right.
And I - what was I supposed to do, throw her out?
It's none of my business?
Peekaboo, you fucks, you.
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
I just told you. She called me.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
Well...
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Okay. You come by the house?
No, Ace.
...position...
That's right. She will get fired. In fact, I want you to send her back to Paris.
We need this guy.
We can't get rid of him?
Hey, Mitch.
Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot.
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Maybe you shouldn't drink so much.
What do you need?
Why do you need that much?
Huh?  Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
No, he didn't.
Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
Right.
Pretty serious.
How serious?
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
With what?
I bought him a watch too.
But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand?
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
With Jennifer.
And where'd you go?
Why do you want to do that?
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
What if he won't stop?
Let me tell you something.  Listen to me.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
Get - Get up! Get up!
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
Don't you threaten me!
You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Yeah, thanks for not callin' me a liar. You son-of-a-bitch. You son-of- a
Loose machines are right back over there.
What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
...worst possible time for me.
I'm just curious. I saw you shuffling your checks with your right hand. Can you do that with both hands?
Look what they did to my hand, man!
What?
I ju- Well, it's a nice pen. I just didn't know whose it was. I thought it was yours. I didn't want it to get lost.
Get out of here.
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
You shut up.
You gotta go back out there.
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Hi. Good.
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Leave me alone!
Is that what you did?
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
I think, you know, maybe he went across the street or somewhere else or somethin'. I don't know.
Calm down! Calm down!
I'm askin' you, Frankie, to keep an eye on Nicky. Do it for me.
Mm.
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He gives a fuck what I do?
Oh, come on.
You're so nice. 
You just relax. Nobody's killin' anybody, do you hear?
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Yeah?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
No, he's not.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya.
What about my money?
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Yes!
Yes.
No, you're not. Where are you? Where are you?
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
No, Lester.
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Okay, then.
Here.
...they're in Penthouse K.
Yes, don't worry.
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around.
I took care of everybody.
Hey. This is Shelly.
...Remo and the guys used to hang out and count their millions.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Whoa. Calm down.
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
Listen to me, Anthony. I got your head in a fuckin' vise. I'm gonna squash your fuckin' head like a grapefruit if you don't give me a name. Don't make me have to do this, please. Come on. Don't make me be a bad guy. Come on.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I'm positive.
Receipts and bills and... everything's here.
I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
I know, but that's enough.
The crowd bought it.
You know, nobody likes you...
He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
What's the matter...
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
This ring belonged to my sister. I'd love for you to...
I can. That's not an admission of guilt,  It's just..I knew you had it in you...
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
You might be right, but Fun is overrated.  I need something real.
What did you say?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
Yes. I am the reporter or the architect.  You've been through so much..It looks like you've used up all nine of your lives...
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
How did you know our nanny's name is...Lucky guess!
What's the name of your child's best friend?
Enough.
Did you try to kill...
Okay, deal.
Oh, I forgot to tell you, you're on a diet...The fact you're still reasonably pretty is the one thing you got going for you.
Maybe.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
Where were you last night?  I didn't hear you come in.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
Who's on the phone?
What's this?
Lady, don't let him do it!
You never miss a trick.
That's your "rep."
What do you mean tip the cops?  Is the man a lunatic or what?
And stop with the directions.
That's illegal.  You want us pulled over?  I'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
Let's hope so.  Once you come out and okay everything I'll give Caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
Nels, don't let that cop pass you.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
Any minute.
Lady, try making some sense.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Sure.  And they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
Well I'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when I'm about to make the most important score of my life.  This has gotta be some "put-on," right?
You're the one who's not to be believed.
Why would anybody want to hurt you?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
No don't.  You could lose me for good.  Don't go through that tunnel.
Please.
Stop throwing names at me.
Rachel, my daughter.  She's an honor student at Parker.  My God, she's only nine.
What do they need her for?
Hello?  It's just me and you again.
I don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
A woman?
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I wasn't always like that.  I don't think I was.
I'm about ten blocks from the school.
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
No.
I should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
What bank?
I'm not doing too well.  What's the matter?
I'm cutting across to Bundy to Brentwood.  That bank is our best bet.  If anybody shows up I could follow them.
Jack will negotiate with them. He'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let Rachel go.
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Or somebody else there is listening in --
Yes.
Now I have -- it's a long story.
It belongs to the man you took it from.  Or should I saw <u>stole</u> it from?
I thought it was inspired.
Who's in back?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
You, I would've noticed.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
Naturally.
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Twenty percent.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
Some loyalty.
I'm here.  Where are you?
I don't need to relax.  The woman. Put her on.
I make my end of the cash at 184,000.  Now I'm trying to figure out the bonds.  What the face value is.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
There's two police cars now.
Where do I turn?
Have your cab wait at the foot of Cisco -- we'll ride up together.
I already called for an ambulance.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
Now he can look.... Ask him does he like his hair, Col.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Did I?
Don't chuck my clothes out!
Fuck off, Dave.
In a way.
Who's she?
Everybody wants something.
Perform?
You want me to ask you in, right?
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.
How special?
Jesus Christ!
Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Would you like a drink?
Depends what it is.
Sure I do.
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Don't.
You could say that.
And you wouldn't leave me?
I'm going home!
I had to go to work!
So tell me.
You heard what I said, Dil?
What pills?
Are you supposed to take that many?
You didn't.
Love you, Dil.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
It's my name, Dil --
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Need to lose myself awhile.
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Tough work, that.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
I heard.
Eddie and Tinker died.
I know.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Leave her out of this.
You were made for this.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Jude?
So?
You're his keeper. If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't mind. But you're the only one he looks at.
You'll have minimal contact with the prisoner, do you hear me?
And what's she like between the sheets?
And you know what'll happen if you fuck up again, don't you?
Thank God for that.
Right.
Thank you, handsome.
How did you know it was her?
Now, if you took the ropes off, I'd be able to feed myself.
No fucking way.
Hey --
Do what?
They won't let him die.
I'm not a gambling man.
Only that you're all tough undeluded motherfuckers. And that it's not in your nature to let me go.
She's mine. Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Never.
So what's that supposed to mean?
Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having two pints in the Rock.
What?
What?
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Cricket's in the halfpenny place.
And you know what?
Where are you, ol' buddy?
All right -- where's the letter?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
What about it?
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
When you come on, you really come on.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
His -- real -- ?
I believe you.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Describe him.
Gratine, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
That's the spirit.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Me? Why me?
It's Charles!
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Here --  Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Starting with his own.
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Sorry about that.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Not my room!
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
Why you lied to me.
Carson Dyle is dead.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day.  Ouch!
Alexander.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Whitefoot, of course.
Who told you to do that?
They've got Jean-Louis!
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
No sense messing up the streets.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door!
It's a start, anyway.
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
In your money, perhaps $65,000.
It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it.
Forty-five thousand.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
Swiss.
He didn't have one.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
I found it! I found it!
Up there! It is up there!
A man traded with me -- all those for only four.
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Quitter.
Peter Joshua.
Good for you.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Instant divorce you mean?
Hallo, Peter.
Don't you understand French?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
What are you doing in here?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
I don't think I follow you.
What was it?
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
Do you know what's wrong with you?
Peter -- are you all right?
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
What are you talking about?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
Words can hurt very much.
a alors! From Charles?
But what?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
What's the matter, chrie?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's aunt. He asked me to come talk to you.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
So?
I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
It's almost ten o'clock.
Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
Can you describe her? How old was she?
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school. Two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
I am.
You're the killed.
Mark Shale.
I don't watch him eat everyday.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
You ok?
I won't.
Stag?
They're all on microfiche. What year are you looking for?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
I was worried about you. Did you hear about the bash?
I do not.
I'll think about it.
All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
My dad's down there!
Go to the police station!
Hi princess.
Lisa Sherman?
How could you?
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
His mother's side.
What?
Did you want one?
Ok.
What, do you work for my boss, dog?

...that is going to explode...
Oh...
Where's Sam?
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Since today.  New policy.
...and fair...
Oh.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, I'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible. 
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
No, no, no, no, no.  We gotta go to McGruder!  I go where the truck goes!
No, no, no.
Take your gun!
...work!  It's not even load-...
Oh, shit.
    Elvis is on ice again.
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
Oh, shit.

You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!

...do we?
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
 Okay.
...easy, easy, easy.
...Night Shift, but you might...
Whoo!
What are you talkin' about?!  I'm the one drivin'!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
 Oh...
 ...shit!
 Go, go.
All right.


Worth a try.
See, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
We got two paddles.
I mean, if that gun was...
...split.
...miles.

Are you all right?
Listen, Arlo.
Huh?
 Come on!
 All right.  Okay.

Okay, here we go.
Aw, shit.  Would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
Here...
...our ass!
Stupid.
Mason.
What?
Come on.  Come on.
What?

Look out.
You know, we saved half a million people from a full-body peel.

Who had to put a gun to your head?
You.
 Yeah.
That was quick.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...here.   Mason... 


We've got it...
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!
...owe you.
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
...to take any extreme measures I deem necessary...
They were all wearing hardware.
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
But you have no choice but to follow orders.
No!
Is this stool taken?
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
All right.  After they put you away...
Pleasant surprise.
And I'm warning you, Leo.  Don't test me. Get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
All right.  Tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
...-ther orders?
You can't fire on them.  You're gonna detonate the crystals.
Just when we have all the cards, Vaughn.  Take these two behind the van.
...here!
This river ends at a hydro dam...
You know the suspect?
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
Iced coffee.
Quite a getup for jacking...
Uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  But mostly, well, they just take a six...
Doc...
...though.
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
You try anything, it goes in...
...-tainer!




Goddamn it, Ma-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
Secrets.
It's after five...
Rangers.
The sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.
Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...
Tie a fly...
...back...
Shit!  Oh, shit. 
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
Never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
And only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
Mr. Sweeney, how goes it?
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
We've got the real thing!
Mason, what is the temperature of Elvis?!
...-lem?
...-damn phone.
Do it now.
Uh, so head for the other end of the tunnel.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
Now!  Seal that tunnel now!
I don't know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. I make an honest living.
I'll settle for L.A. County.
Then these are all new owners?
If that's what it says.
Can I check one of these volumes out?
Sir?
You know, you've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.
They're calling it an accident.
It's what the D.A. used to tell me about Chinatown.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
How did you find out?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
What does this mean?
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Oh they don't?
I don't know...
I said okay, Jake.
Why?
Did you know that you're a very wealthy woman?
Give us things. Not just some old flag like this, but -
Or her name?
Mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.
I know what he says.
Matter of fact I do.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
That's it?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Would you like something to drink?
Well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  She's disappeared. Maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Why?
You mean you don't know where you were?
Yes... why?
No, not for that one.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no.  Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way.  Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Why?
Just... I have to.
And I want to know where.
I am not!
Did you get some sleep?
What did you do that for?
I found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. They belonged to your husband, didn't they?... didn't they?
What are you saying?
That's good. Now what's her name?
Katherine?... Katherine who?
I have to go home and get my things.
When did you come in?
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
...Why don't you give me your address and we can talk this over?
Of course.
I'm sorry, I --
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Yeah.
No, really?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray. These men are my operatives and at some point they're going to assist me. I can't do everything myself.
That's swell. But how about here?  Ever worked for Robert Knox, Emma Dill, Clarence Speer, Marian Parsons, or Jasper Lamar Crabb?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
It's personal. Has he been out long?
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He owned the water department?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
Duffy, go over and sit on Mulvihill.  Jesus Christ, I didn't tell you to bring the police department with you.
Neither do I.
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget...  So, Toto, how are these home movies going? 
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Father, I have sinned...
Who?
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Then where's the money?
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
I can't take shorthand.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
Say, with them fellows -  - it's no trick to get circulation.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Oh, yes, it's already made up.  Our Mr. Mervin wrote a small review.
That Rosebud?  Maybe some girl?  There were a lot of them back in the early days, and -
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
What's the matter?
Mr. Bernstein, these men who are now with the "Enquirer" - who were with the "Chronicle" until yesterday - weren't they just as devoted to the "Chronicle" kind of paper as they are now to - our kind of paper?
Do we stand for the same things that the "Chronicle" stands for, Mr. Bernstein?
Don't I always?  Most of the time?
My little sanctum is at your disposal. But I don't think I understand -
I've been a newspaperman my whole life and I don't intend -  - if it's your intention that I should continue to be harassed by this - this -  I warn you, Mr. Kane, it would go against my grain to desert you when you need me so badly - but I would feel obliged to ask that my resignation be accepted.
We haven't heard from him.
Almost two to one -
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -
What's this all about, Emily?  I've had a very tiring day and -
What's the matter with you?
You're no Venus de Milo.
No.  But you're close.
You've been wonderful!  I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and - 
Oh, no, that's all gone.
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
Is that really your idea of how to run a newspaper?
Is Mrs. Kane - 
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Do you think you're the one who should call him a great man?
- and that copy of the "Enquirer" said the President should be killed.
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks -  Nobody can blame me because -
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
Brad, you are drunk.
Are you finished?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
Maybe you could remember something that -
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
Well, that's about all there is - and I'm getting chills.  Hey, nurse!  Five years ago, he wrote from that place of his down South -  - you know.  Shangri-la?  El Dorado?  Sloppy Joe's?  What's the name of that place?  You know...  All right. Xanadu.  I knew what it was all the time.  You caught on, didn't you?
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Yeah, all in crates.
Turn that thing off, will you?  It's driving me nuts!  What's Rosebud?
Hold this thing up for a week.  Two weeks if you have to...
But don't you think if we release it now - he's only been dead four days - it might be better than if -
Sentimental fellow, aren't you?
She's plastered, isn't she?
She'll snap out of it.  Why, until he died, she'd just as soon talk about Mr. Kane as about anybody.  Sooner.
Am I sure?
You're shittin' me.
You're loitering in here, and causing a disturbance.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in.
You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching?
Can I watch?
You can hold me down.
Exactly.
Nobody! I swear!
Train. It took eight hours.
Very dramatic, I thought.
I know, I'm sorry. But when we started talking... it's like I forgot I had a boyfriend. And then he proposed last month...
And you said yes?
Well... kind of, sort of?
Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle- I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.
If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him?
You mean, on a date?
Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.
Sang.
So what are you saying?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
When you just lie perfectly still and let me do everything.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
With this guy locked in?
In a second!
I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even.
I work in a shitty video store. I want to go to a good video store so I can rent a good movie.
Pack of cigarettes.  Cute cat. What's its name?
I saw one, one time, that said the world was ending the next week. Then in the next week's paper, they said we were miraculously saved at the zero hour by a Koala-fish mutant bird. Crazy shit.
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Shocking abuse of authority.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
You win.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Chess team Allan Harris?!
Oh shit, I've got to place an order.
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
The Emperor.
I guess.
There's more?
Yeah.
And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.
And you figured it out?
He said it was important to have standards. He said nobody has pride anymore.
Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?
Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.
Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss.
What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Why'd you apologize?
You know what pisses me off the most?
Sorry.
Design major.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Listen to you.
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
You know what? I don't think I care for your rationale.
I didn't think they even enforced this.
Because I'm happy.
You're happy to get a fine?
Now I know you're lying.
You're a snake.
Have some chips; you'll feel better.
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
Make them change.
I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.
Why the fuck did you tell Veronica that I was going to dump her for Caitlin?
I thought I was doing you a favor.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Do you work tomorrow?
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
One seventy-nine.
I should start.
Meaning?
I understand, but can I use it. I'm not that young anymore, so I'm kind of... you know... incontinent.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
Jesus... go ahead.
The porno mags?
I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
And I actually date you?
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
Three?
You've only had sex with three different people?
I'm not the pig you are.
You!
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
To school. There's a seminar about getting back into a scholastic program after a lapse in enrollment.
He gets off on it.
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
HOW MANY?
Something like thirty-six.
I'm going to class.
Hey listen, jerk! Until today you never even knew how many guys I'd slept with, because you never even asked. And then you act all nonchalant about fucking twelve different girls. Well, I never had sex with twelve different guys!
No, but you sucked enough dick!
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
Sure.
And then you pull that shit this morning, freaking out because I've gone down on a couple guys!
It stings a little.
I'm not out of shape!
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
You're gonna be at John K's party?
I'm not sad.
No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it!  He has his friend do it for him!
He didn't ask me to...
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Bye. 
Hey, Gabe, we're flyin' off the Tower today.  C'mon with us.
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
Hal's signalling he's OK.
I don't know.
If I don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
Bags?
I think it's out.  No big deal. It's that old football injury.
Funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can I count as fast as I like?
Nice and easy...
Do you see them yet?
That's a virtue isn't it?
We spent a night there one night...
And when I came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
Maybe I can help. Let's see... if one night I got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, I think what I'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
Did I miss something?
Resuscitation?
Gabe, did you come back to stay?  You didn't.
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
He doesn't want my help.
He can handle it.
You still wear the cable necklace I gave you.
I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
Want me to lead?
Frank!  No, Frank!  Frank!
Reach up!  Do it!
Where's the helicopter?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
Qualen, go fuck yourself.  The game's over--you lost.
On top of the peak.
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing--
Calm down...give the gun to me. You're out of control, son.
Why?  What are you going to do?!
I don't trust him.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
Richard Travers.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
Been punished, yeah?
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
My wife... Alex freezes.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, sir. Julian bars the way.
So this is the young man?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Fine, sir, fine.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
You've not been to school all week, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
Do you still feel suicidal?
I did, sir.
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good job on a good salary.
What job and how much?
Keeping fit then?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.
Let me get up.
Murder, sir.
Yes sir.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Now then, were you in Police custody this morning?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Lice?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
We're going to friends now, sir.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Something like that.
Fine. Fine.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Oh.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Leave to carry on, sir, please?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.
How many to a cell?
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
The ride is free.
No.  I got lucky with the lights.
Let me guess.  Clarinet?
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Bottega.
Not quite.  He did defense.  I'm a prosecutor...
Max...
...I was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  Didn't pay but shit, but that wasn't the point.  Being around the music, that was the thing.  And I was.  Take this one night...July 22, 1964...who walks in?  Mr. Louis Armstrong.
He'd come over from Queens to do the Ed Sullivan show.  After, he decides to come on up to Harlem and hang with the common folk.  That's how he was, you see.  Never forgot where he came from.  Money and fame an' all that?  Meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  So before you it, he's up on that stage, doin' his thing.
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
So?
Elvis?
What's your name?
Try?
I got caught up at work.
We're gay lovers, what's it to you?
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You know, this is the cleanest cab I've ever been in.  This your regular ride?
Why not?
I don't talk about it, you know...  No offense.
You - you killed him?
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
Tonight it is.
What'd he do to you?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little Miles thing happening.  Awesome.  What do you think?
Damn right.  Instinct, man.  If you think too much, it doesn't work.  Just listen...
Max?  What are you doing?
You go every night?
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
What, no insurance?
Gimme your wallet.
I...I wasn't thinking.  I just did it.
How long have you been a hit man?
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
Who's Heller?
What'd they do?
What happened?
Who?
That's love.
Sure.  And the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  Nearly snapped me in half.
Saved you last night's, too.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry.  We're talking billions. Motive enough?
I think you're different.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
It's okay.  The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  He had it coming.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Yes.
If my universe had a hub...
Can you prove any of this?
Who?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Uh huh.
Shoot.
Is this your dad?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way.  Everything you do is magic.
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
Did you kill him?
Where were you the day he died?
Did you kill my father?!
Then tell me what happened.
Do I know you?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry?  Who else knows what you know?
We've arranged for you to take the blame.  Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
That's ironic.  Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're here because you figured I might show up.
I'm leaning toward no.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them?  Why him?
As in 'resulting in death.'  We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
We've lost contact.
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
Michael Kitz, National Security Advisor.
What in the hell...?
I'm willing to take that risk.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
No primer.
Dr. Cullers?
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
Could we hear God?
So who -- what -- are you?
You contacted us.  We were simply listening.  We've been listening for millions of years.
You always have been.  We're all descendants of the same stars, Ellie.  All made of the same primordial atoms.
No more stalling, Captain.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Oh, not quite yet.  At least for their sake...  ... I hope it's not.  Because they're running out of time.
The systems integration site.
I read your paper on ETI's.  It's brilliant.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
The V.L.A.?
But the work --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
Jesus --
It's really happening.
Like it or not.
I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position.  Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
Maybe you're creating a monster.
You're willing to die for this.
What'd you think?
I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie.  I'm not 'out to get' technology.  I only ask the question:  Does it have to have all the answers?  I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
And then what?  Then you'll be safe?
-- I don't know --
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.
But --
Recommendations?
I don't know.  Maybe we built the damn thing wrong.  Maybe it was all a hoax...  The safest thing would probably be to do a Chernobyl; encase it in concrete.
I don't think you understand. We made a deal ---
You don't take another man's place, boy.
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
That's good: he earned it.
Gotta have kings.
She's on to him. You shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Borrowin'.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
Come on, Drag. Lemme take a look.
A cold drink? Okay?
Nuthin'! A handfull of nuthin'!  You stupid mullet-head. He beat you with nuthin'! Just like today when he kept coming back at me.
Where'd the road go?
We ain't goin' nowhere.
But, Luke...
You just said he could eat anything.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
You can't switch 'round jobs, anyway. I figured he knew that.
You're fired.
It's almost six.  And guess what? Hall likes me bathed and shaved.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
Only part.  What else?  What did you think of his claim that he tied this girl to the tree and set fire to her because Joan of Arc told him to do it.
He was lying.
Cut the crap.  You got a sheet the length of my arm...
The door was already open...
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
You come and visit.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
We'll show that to...
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
'...great dark hall of fame... all our greatest killers...'  His greatest <u>heroes</u>?  He wants to be famous.  When they're caught and people like me write about them, we give them a kind of immortality. They get thousands of letters. Ramirez kills eight women and gets a hundred marriage proposals a month.  They're like film stars.
What happened to you?!
I just thought it was so -- unprofessional.  Of you both!
Who's the married man?
Yes.  Dahmer!  And after that...
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
MaryJane.  We call her M.J.
I'll get a locksmith.
He was in my apartment!
You touch anything, Mike?  Pick up anything?  Use the doorknob?  I don't want to find your prints on anything later and you tell me you forgot to tell me.
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.
Not what I meant; why <u>me</u>?
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
Christ.  I didn't lock the fucking drawer!  You spend twenty years thinking some perp's gonna whack you... you'll crash your car... but what happens is, you fuck yourself...  You can't imagine how many times I saw you two... your head together, I wish him dead.  Every time... Want to hear something weird?  I feel like I'd give my life to bring him back.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
What about her arms?
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You messed with the scene.
What clues?  I'm going to work Helen Hudson.
Saks.  If he knew you did that! They're all asking me, 'what is she doing,' as it is.
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
I don't want the job.  Don't do that to her.  She's worked too damned hard for it.
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
Have you seen it?
I can't sit on this balcony forever. I'm beginning to feel like a potted plant.
You're not envious?
I thought that was you, up there.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Look at all this traffic. I'm not sure I can deal with it.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
I've always wanted to drive a crashed car.
It's very... satisfying. I'm not sure I understand why.
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
What kind of place is this?
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
She says she won't even come if Dad brings Monica.
How?
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Oh no.
I gather he's late as usual.
I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he says...
I'm so glad to see you. You can't believe the people in here. They've got patients posing as doctors...
Maybe I should talk about this with Ruth, or Paul.
I answered these questions last night.
No.
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
We'll get caught.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Really, though. My thoughts go haywire sometimes.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Wow.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I think I should go home.
Are you OK?
Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who likes magic?
Michael, take it easy.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
Well then why'd it happen?
So, another one bites the dust.
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
Forget I asked.
Sure. Why?
Yeah, I guess it's all right.
I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
So will you?
Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me? Letty, it's natural to be nervous. But we're going to work through our problems.
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.
Oh, none. None. I completely understand what was going on.
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
Getting back.
What?
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
Do you know who this is?
A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
They're supposed to be evidence.    That's why Bastaldi set this up.
Who?
Uh, yeah.
He's trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes. You ever watch it?
And for my help I would get what?
Half the tapes.
I only ask so I can call you when the arrangements are made.
Thank you.
Hopefully no one.
Do they come with batteries?
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
Okay. Airports, train stations, bus station are out. We know they're connected to the car rental agencies because that's where they picked up Raymond.
Hello?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What?
Did you have to use that much explosive?
Guns.   Can you get them?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
What?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
I don't know.     I didn't look.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
You lived there. You know the city.
It's my idea.
God, I want to go home.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry... but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
How's my brother?
How are we going to do that?
I would like to thank you for your hospitality.  If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.
I say we make him pay first. After that you can do whatever you want to him.
Something like that.
It looks old.     Did you get it a long time ago?
Who are you waiting for?
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating you all right? Food okay?
Okay.    Okay.
I don't care about your sword.
This Jade Fox is a woman?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
No, really?
Too bad for Meng, but it's not your fault, or Li Mu Bai's.
How dare you accuse us?  I always knew you had stolen the sword! I've done nothing but protect you and your family.  And you're repaid me with nothing but contempt.  Li Mu Bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  We wanted some peace and you've ruined it all! You're no sister of mine!
You can't die!  Tell us what poison you used!  You can't die!  Tell us the antidote!  You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
Take my horse and go to the compound. Give this to Mrs. Wu.  She'll help you.  Hurry!
Not another lecture!  On guard!
Let's end this here.
Lo?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Give me back my comb.
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
No.  I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment.  Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  I couldn't bear it.  I broke off my meditation.  I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
What do you mean?  Didn't you come back here for it?
Then, why did you come?
True.  But I must borrow it for one last mission.  Jade Fox must die at its edge.  Did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
I knew she would intrigue you.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Shu Lien... The things we touch have no permanence.  My master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
What about you?
What happened?
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
They're gone.
If you surrender now, you'll suffer less.  But if you resist, I won't stop until you're dead.
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
But the sword could be in his compound.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
What do you have in mind?
Care for a hot dog?
Just don't tell me you "owe me one."  What file?
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
My name.
You sorta looked like you might need my help.
This isn't your place.  This isn't your fight.  And I don't need your help.
I was wonderin' where you'd gotten to --  Oh, Elly, honey, a cat.  Here?
No.
What's goin' on, Elly?
And how many lives have you destroyed?
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy.
Don't waste my time.
Do you know of spirit assassins? You do know the dead can rise? Properly motivated, of course.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Did you know Sebastian well?
Are you okay?
I have his journal.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Why are you being so dramatic?
What'cha reading?
You've read The Fountainhead?
You need help.
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
Thank you.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm busy.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
No, not at all.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
I do.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
Would you like a tour?
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been with my family for over sixty years. Does your family do much riding?
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
Greg McConnell.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Does your mother know?
That's one way of looking at it.
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
What are you doing?
You promised to let me kiss you.
Want to join me?
I'm taking a shower.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
Yes!
I'm pretty sure she did.
She bought it.
Hello.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Racist piece of shit.
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
I see your point... though why should I care?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Nothing.
Exactly the opposite.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
It was... Fantastic.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
I have a flair for drama.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Didn't you hear what I said?
I did?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
What do you mean?
On the back street  a green house
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death.  And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Yes, darling,
I haven't had my breakfast.
No, she went runnin' off to some old house she was talkin' about yesterday.
Your birthday, Amy --  as she goes) -- and I have something for you in my locker. A present.
They ran away.
It's true.
And who did the voice belong to?
No, I didn't.
Daddy!
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?
Yes, darling.
Irena. But who are you?
I'm your friend.
You'll always play with me?
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
All right, Amy.  Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
I shall wear it in my hair!
You wanted to share this moment with me.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
But why?
Most surely that was a nice lady to give a ring to a little girl.
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Bad luck to see death in the snow.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
What?
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Yes...yes, that's true.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
Well, ma'am, the truth is, I gave them to Amy hersolf to post.
And Amy mailed them?
I like to see her happy.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
"To Daddy from Amy." Here's one for Miss Callahan. This one says, "To Edward from Amy.".
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
But don't you see...it's just what I was about to say to Alice...Amy in her own mind may not be lying.
But we have. She's wanted for nothing.
No way is that the same chick. The other one was a dog.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
I have cramps. I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Or if there's a full moon.
What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
Hey, did you get contacts?
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a guy, I'm wearing no make-up.
Please come over. I'm begging you. What should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or... Peter?
He's been here all night?
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
Peter knows something.
Great so all I have to do is fall in love? Like I haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
I'm cleaning my stove.
I guess you'll find out.
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
Hello?
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I know.
So you're Grant's secretary?
What?
Yes I do have to pee!
You never say that.
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
So pay them back and apologize.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory was outside my front door.
Are you following me?
You wanna get some coffee?
No, no... But Mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. Maybe he kills men you date.
No, why?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
Hello?
Take some allergy medicine.
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
You seem a little edgy.  Everything okay?
To tell you the truth, I'm glad we've run into each other like this.  Maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
I don't know what you're talking about.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
Who?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor...
But...  How long has this been happening?
Then we must call the police.
If you like.
We are little more than a sum of memories.  From them we reference who we are, where we're going.  Without a past we are nothing.  This is why you are so interesting.
I have to go...
You're a liar!
Why?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Holy cow.
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
I can't believe he'd do this.
Till what?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Check his kids.
Clean.
Uh, let me get back to you...
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Three years.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
I'll lock him away for good.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
That'd be great.
Look, I'm sorry.  I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
We've got to fix this.
`Dave'?
Perceptual?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Oh... Thanks.
Oh, come on, we're not children.  I didn't have anything to do with this Fidelity nonsense and you know it.
They re not my attack dogs.
How'd you get started?
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Who?
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
That was quite a thing you did today.
Where's home?
I don't mind.
What?
What?
You find people jobs?
What?
I can't.
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
What is it?
Quiet!
You'd hold us back. We have to go on.
We always planned to use it. We got some ground up already...but we could never find enough.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
I thought the purpose of decapitation was to...to...
He is dying. He knows it.
NOOOOOOOOO!
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
I don't think they're in school.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Knox, you gotta calm down.
He flatters me so I'll help him with Latin.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
"O, no, it is an ever-fixed mark That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
Who else was involved in this?
Todd's brother is Jeffrey Anderson.
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
It's Nuwanda.
Nuwanda, what is going on?
Where'd you find them?
You still shouldn't have done it, Charlie.  You don't speak for the club.
Why don't you talk to Mr. Keating about it?
What good will that do?
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Hello Chris, this is Knox Overstress.
Well, sure!
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Look, I've got to go.  I'm gonna be late for the play.
What is that?
What is wrong with old habits, Mr. Overstreet?
LOUDER!
A madman.
I... I close my eyes.  His image floats beside me.
Don't stop!
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
Okay.
Isn't there an easier way?
Too bad.
All the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  Forget her.  Take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
They're friends of my dad.  Probably in their nineties or something.
Any group pictures in the annual?
If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  That is where they should be.  Now put foundations under them.
I hear we're going to be roommates. Neil Perry.
I... I just don't want to come.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
Found what?
So?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Er  No.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
Noooo!
Seen a lot of islands?
Yeah you did...
Finnegan...
You want ME to go up there?
Sure I do...I give a shit that at 0300 hour we reach our point of dentination. I give a shit that those mojos got to do what they got to do, and 45 minutes later we are turn around and gone. I give a shit that by the time the sun comes up we are all safely tucked in bed.
Joey...
Nothing.
I'm not screwing around with you man...I hate the cold water.
Damn right!
We're all going.
Nick's going?
You're full of shit.
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
You don't!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Where should I hit it? Just show me where I should hit it.
Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got married! Vince got married!
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Kind of. You didn't know?
Biederman! Where's Biederman!
You Biederman?
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Linda...
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
How are you?
Frost.
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
What are you doing?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Merle?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Fucking A.
From Nam?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets.
No way. No fucking way!
When you get the AK, open up. You got me? Open up.
You wanna bet?
No!!!?
This is this, Vince. This isn't something else. This is this!
Yeah.
One, Vince... you have to understand, doing it with one... would be... like nothing. They're small, see, so if you're smart you get about six or eight. I mean, if you want to have any fun.
Up I would say... What would you say?
Up.
Kimberly!
I was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath I was dirty. You helped bury me.
Well, you've just been taken off the bench.
Mug sheets.
You're crazy.
That's not your zone.  Stick to data entry.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Just great.
Fine.
Need help?
Yes.
I drive.
See those guys?
There's no time.  There are civilians in there.  It's about to go down.
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Two lousy smokes.  You're a real sport.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
You're not pregnant, are you?
Let's roll.  We got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to Doucet. 0800 this morning.
You treat her nice.
You okay?
You all right?
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
You're not resting well, are you? I know -- it's that music.  You need your sleep. Is there anything else you want?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
Howdy, Jabez.
What do you want?
Belle.
What's the matter with you?
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
The seventh day of April --
Are they all as -- small -- as that?
Well -- Mr. Webster! This is a great day for me. Come on in, sir. I want you to take the seat of honor and meet all my guests!
Yes, Mr. Webster -- it was here where it all began.
Not long -- now.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Well, Jabez -- I'm a little pressed for time. You wanted to discuss something -- some business --
Dan'l Webster?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
5000 -- that's just what I owe you.
Oh, Jabez.
I remember Dad used to say sometimes, when they were handing out hard luck, the farmers got there first.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
Mary -- it's gone.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez ...
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
You'll never change -- will you?
I am going to lock him up.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
Why don't they come --
Jabez!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
I know, Ma, but -- Suppose a man got his money in bad ways --
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.
What a nice -- and kind girl --  Who is she --?
The new girl -- Jabez says; she is from over the mountain.
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
Well, Martin, I only wear them in Washington -- that's the trouble. But if you ever come down there, I'll show them to you.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Oh ..  not that you ever get drunk! No, indeed! But a kind of overpowering lassitude or, more plainly, a deep and enveloping sleep.
There isn't enough Medford rum in the whole of New Hampshire to make me sleepy. 
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
If your friend is hot to trot...I know a couple of mama bears.  ...Or is he married?
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.
No, sir.
John.
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television...
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Hans.  Your Hans.
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
John!
Look...I'm getting a bad feeling up here...I'd like you to do something for me.  Look up my wife...don't ask how, you'll know by then...and tell her...tell her...I've been a jerk. When things panned out for her, I should've been behind her all the way ...We had something great going until I screwed it up...She was the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.  She's heard me say I love you a thousand times, but she never got to hear this...honey...I'm sorry.  You get all that?
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
Hey, don't take the car!
Well... I'm out of the hospital.
Yeah... I know.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
Oh... wow!  Sonny, you're really into one mess now.
Sal... Sal... Naturale, oh boy!
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
Do you still want the operation?
Oh no!
I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything.
You try calling the police?
He needed money?  For the operation for you?
It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!'  So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me.
You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
They're okay.
Call me whatever you want.
They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then.
He wanted to kill me!
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
Sonny, your wife's on the way ... We reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
All right ... I got some hungry people in there ... I want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
What else?
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
What's the matter with you?
The gun's right on your back...
Hello, Mulvaney here...
What if I take you with me?
You like me?
You know ... I like you people ... I really do.
We like you, too.
Are you a lawyer?
What now, Sonny?
Yeah.  Well, you're okay?
How did you know your son was involved?
No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure!
Pure?
Let's go, Sonny.
Where's the money?
You mean that?
What?
Dead or alive?
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?
What kind of a deal?
... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
I don't want him.
Okay, who's the head teller here?
Hey, you okay?
Hey, let's get ready!
Fuck!  We did it!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
Oh my God, mother!
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  Since then, forget it.
Maybe...
Why are you doing this?
The audience is interested in you, Sonny ... not me.
What?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
<i>I'm calling from the Kappa Epsilon Gamma house at California University.</i>
<i>Remove... ... the... right arm.</i>
<i>Did you get all four?</i>
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
Not yet. <b> INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NEXT </b> Alf pulls onto the 15 FREEWAY.
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Must you use that awful word?
Cunt.
I said stop it.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
We are so fucked.
Okay.  Domino Harvey is here.
This could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. It's self-reflexive reality television.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
Ya back is got.
My brother.
I'll fuck you up quick two times.
Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
Why it gotta be about jungle music and Africa?
How come you ain't got no brothers up?
Buggin' Out, I gotta work here.
I'm cool.  I'm cool.
No, you the man.
No!
Squash it.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I think no such a thing.  Sal pays you, you should work.
Stop tripping.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
Mookie, no cursing in the store.
Mookie!  How is anybody gonna call in?
Yeah, do you know 'em?
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
OK.  OK.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
No!  No!  You won't come back either.
Later.
Just coolin'.
You talk to 'em.
Mookie is not to be trusted.  No Moulan Yan can be trusted.  The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  In the back.
You really think so?
Can you do better?  I didn't think so.  This is a respectable business.  Nuthin' wrong with it.  Get dat broom.
How ya doin', Mookie?
Pop, I'm gonna go with Mookie.
Oh my god, are you alright?
Kan maaaaw Roy Orbison kin nah mah oh che.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
HARRY!
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Yeah, she must do all the flying around when I'm asleep.  HARRY Dunne.
No, it's a treasure map.
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Peg leg?
She did not.
...and who was Benjamin Franklin again?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
According to the map, we're just about at school.
Who's your partner?
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Oh yeah, buddy, you're gonna get "some".
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
I don't think so.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
But-
HARRY!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
No. What happened?
But my mom gave me the map.
Wait, wait!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Oh, good. There's Jessica.
Hey there goes Principal Collins!
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, leave him alone.
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
That's my boyfriend.
You really are a pirate.
So I'm an "arrrrrs-hole", eh Captain Rob?
Sure.
Yeah, deal. Give me the two dollars.
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
Collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do I do if he smells the trap.
We start our own class?
You said "aloha" twice.
Wow, you are smart.
Knock knock.
What papers?
What happens now?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
Can you hear me?... If this visit has anything to do with spice... -- The Guild Navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
So, this is Leto the Just...
Paul!!  Paul!!
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
As the legend says.
Remove her gag!
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
Run!
You've worn a stillsuit before?
No one. It... seemed the proper way.
 I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear... I will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- The Reverend Mother moves her face up to his. Her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. She is smiling.
Did they try and fail?
I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down the hall.
Those sounds could be imitated.
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.
Who are you?  What do you want?
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Don't you bave a car?
Boy, Mr. Lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  When is your next picture coming out?
The <u>women</u>?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Eh, forget it.  What else is big?  Teenagers!  Jailbait pics!  Yeah... You got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
Ha-ha!  Dr. Acula!
What's in the needle?
Morphine, with a demerol chaser.  Eddie, I'm so broke.  I don't know what I'm gonna do...
"It is my home."
You'll be sitting on the right.
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Really?
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Isn't it wonderful?  After all these years, the press is showing an interest again in Bela Lugosi.
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
Eddie, how was I?
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
Jesus!  Are you serious?
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
And, CUT!  PRINT IT!  LET'S MOVE ON!
Edward Wood, Sir.
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
Better than not getting a job?
No!  A horror movie star!
Close!  The <u>other</u> one!
I told you this was gonna happen.
That's Tony McCoy.  He's playing Lieutenant Dick Craig.
Oh really?  How much money did he put up?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
Dolores, wait!
But you used to say --
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Hruphh...?
You could say that --
Tor!
I think you're quite handsome.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Tor, dialogue is overrated.  You look at the classic film actors, who are they?  Fairbanks.  Chaplin.  They didn't talk!  They did it all with their face.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Yeah.  Crap with a star.
And what's with this new title?!  My poster says "I CHANGED MY SEX"!
Georgie, what's with the stag footage??  You said you were cutting in <u>establishing shots</u>!
I'd seen him in a coffin so many times, I expected him to jump out...
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!
Yes?
You don't wanna be noticed?
Just like I always promised.  Now you're among the immortals.  You're movie stars.
What the heck is THIS?!!
No. The bathroom is off limits -and when I go to sleep they go to other programming. Unless I get up. Then they go back on the air. Unless I get up to go to the bathroom, I guess, then -
At what point?
No, I intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause I don't like you.
Norman Rockwell. He painted magazine covers. Folksy. A mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
Yes!
Oh, Al ... This is just...
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
She doesn't give a shit about him.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
How you doing, Ed?
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah?!
Ed --
Mr. Pekurny.
What?
You said that.
You know who we are?
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Are the TV people with you?
I don't want to -- do you know where he is?
Both.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
To you? In front of him?  With the...
Yes. He assumed Hank was your husband. He didn't know.
She left.
She won't.
What does this mean?
Ha!
Go!
Oh God, this is so weird.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
Everybody hates me!
There's a list.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
My truck overheated, so I opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. So I had to get a haircut.
What's up?
What?
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
She's an alcoholic, for Christ's sake.
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.
Who is it?
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Come on, Ma.
Oh, is Shari here? Why didn't you just say so? Why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
You don't recognize me.
The whole time? Eighteen years?
What...
Hi.
Mm.
Ohhh...
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdo.
pierdes.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Jim, don't.  You're scaring him.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
I'm not supposed to tell. Not until you've counted too. We're each supposed to make an independent count.
You're kidding, right?
I can't wait to start campaigning.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
You're the advisor.  You should stop her.  She's not qualified.  She's just a sophomore.
I'm looking at new cars.
What's this?
Swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
You'll be fine.
What is it. Tammy?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
Exactly when?
Should we get a what?
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Hey Yeah?
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
You're there.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Yeah.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
What?
So?
These are private -- these are for us.
I know.
For what?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Who put you up to this?
Thought what?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Don't you fucking knock?
What do you want, Mr. Policeman?
Pierce meets people.  Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood.  This is how they turned out.  Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Did they deserve it today?
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
So tell me about it.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Give me one minute.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
What happened?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
At least not anymore.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
Why were Lefferts' eyes black?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
There's Gardner, Hepburn, Grable, Turner.  Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake.  I use girls who look like movie stars.  Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon.
That's why her mother couldn't I.D. her... Jesus fucking Christ.
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, <u>forthright</u> men the public can admire.
Man, why do you keep asking me that?
Dogs got no reason to live.
Man, what're you saying?
And?
You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department?
You think golden boy can handle it, Cap?
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
It's not a request.  I need to know what White knows.  Follow him or I'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor.'  Permanently.
Listen, I think I made a mistake, too.
So what's the point?
She is Lana Turner.
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.
Lynn Bracken.
Anything else you want to add before I talk to her?
Some reality.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Okay.  Look, if it helps, Bud hates himself for what he did.
Where will you go?
Do you have any proof?
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Yes.
He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
You've got it on tape?
A direct one.
Who was that other guy?
What <u>is</u> that?
I don't know what that means.
I don't know <u>anything</u>.
Hey, if you live another week I'll be impressed.
I was worried about my hundred and twenty 'K'.
Jesus!
You used to work for 'em, didn't you?
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
What's going on?
Who?
Gimme that.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
What if--
What if we just fucked with 'em?
What are you dialing?
Who's calling?
Well then who can?
With what?
Neil, thank you for your help.
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
It's a little late for that.
Pardon?
I'm sorry. Detective Morelos.
About what?
I can't.
Not a very good one, but--
We won't suspend the civil rights of the good people.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Robert--
You <u>swore</u>!
No, I was with her yesterday. I want you to take Eric and go to our parents house. I want you to do it right now.
It's really over?
It's a brand new card.
My suitcase--
Why the hell would I--
That's not you having a whiskey sour with Carmine Morada.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
Thank you.
For the last four years.
I can't.
I'm sorry about that.
What makes you think it's you?
Yeah?
He didn't <u>give</u> me--
Gentlemen--
Bobby--
You're learning a cruel lesson.
Can I open 'em up?
Sure, go ahead.
In your dreams.
Dad!
No. We're never getting a divorce. We were having a fight. It happens sometimes.
You've got a bunch of Armani suits, they didn't take 'em?
They didn't take the jewelry. They took the computers. They took the big-screen TV, they took my blender.
I love my blender.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Why would the NSA--
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
Bobby, you're in way over your head.
Jerry?
I'm just doing some Christmas shopping. It's for my wife, no kidding. Though, this isn't the <i>main</i> present, it's just, you know, a little--
Dick Burns got a phone call this morning from someone wanting information on you.
I'm not asking you to say for certain. This is what you're trained to do, right?
Fuck you.
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
No, no, I'm sorry. I didn't realize you were hoping to be transferred to a weathership outside Greenland.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
What about--
What's your ETA?
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
I don't care to bargain.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  I apologize if I appear abrupt.  I am rusty at social graces.  How do you find Cairo?  Did you visit the Pyramids?
You felt obliged to.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Will you please come in?
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Say you're sick.
This is - what is this?
Is he next?  Do you drag him into your little room?  Where is it?  Is this it?
We've got to get you out of here.
Why did you hate me?
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
I know.
Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love.  Excessive love of one's wife.
Safe journey.
You too.  Good luck!
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
I've known Katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  I think I'd know what is and what isn't too much for her.  I think she's know herself.
Yes, of course.  So, golly, where have you come from?
Almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  What nationality would that be?
Looking for the fossils.  Why should we wait until we're in London?  This girl was probably twelve years old.
Her hands and feet were tied.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
I believe I'm rather late.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
May God make safety your companion.
Shut-up!
How are you?
They're fresh.  I haven't eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
She can take you as far as Florence.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in.  Like an old boxer.
Is it you?  If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Top Hat.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Well look, if nobody minds, truly, then I suppose - I shall, of course, be bereft
Candaules
He needn't disturb you.
Me?  He can't.  I'm already disturbed.
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
I'm still here.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
You must get away.  Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling.  He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Kip - come and dance with me
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
I was looking forward to this evening.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
Or my wife's.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
You don't call, you don't write.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
I don't know, but close.
I'm in the middle.
I have a question...
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Seems I am.
You disappeared.
Are you...okay?
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
I didn't expect you to be so...
Motorcycle.
It's one way.
And good morning.
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I'll need that.
So how long to pop the floor?
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
Charged?
I trust it's your size.
Thank you.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
Your share.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Transfer.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
And the money goes--
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
No way to take another day or two?
A true master. Classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
Which is--
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Right.
We're supposed to.
Tonight your league night?
You know where my loyalties lie.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
Probably not.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I never lied.  I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Yeah?
What are you doing here?
But, PG&E told her about the chromium?
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
You think there's more?
What now?
You didn't care about my case?
What?  Who?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
What's a demur?
Not in my world.
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Here what comes?
I wasn't gonna --
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Two million dollars?
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Can I play roller hockey?
We'll see.
Hey -- those are my files --
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too.  This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here.  Beth started talking.
Lock the door.
Thinking.
Thank you.
It's just -- the pain.  It's only getting worse.  I can't be a good wife.  I can't be a good mother.
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
Where's my paycheck?
When Donna told us about you, and what you told her about the chromium, we figured that might have something to do with this, too.
I know.  It's an awful lot.
Uh-huh?
Wow, that's soon --
Oh.  Oh.
It was .... the Emperor ....
Yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
Luke, use The Force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  Don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... Luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
The boy is our last hope.
I'm cold ... so cold ...
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Will you?  You underestimate The Emperor.  It is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
How you doing, Chewbacca?  Still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
Barks and growls at his boss.
Howls and shrugs his shoulders.
... Like we're being watched.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
There isn't a hint of life in the area.  But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
You want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
I'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
I'm against that.
What is it?
They're moving away.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
There's something out there!
Couldn't be, I checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  I tell you this time it's not my fault.  I'm sure I checked it.
You could have warned him before you shut him off.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
Hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a Gundark.
This ought to be good.
You don't know much about much if you think Vader won't want us dead before this is over.
Sorry, am I interrupting anything?
What's going on?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Very noble.  Not smart, but noble.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Rather touchy, aren't they.
Artoo, you did it!  I never doubted you for a second ...
I have this ... feeling.  I'm not sure, really ...
What are you talking about?
This hyperdrive had better work.
It would be in seven pieces, were you a Jedi.
But I feel The Force flowing!
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
My mind fills with so many images.
Will they die?
You'll find I'm full of surprises.
Did you call the Zoo?
Do you have a name?
In some fashion -- and I lack the intellect to know precisely how -- we have traveled from Earth's future into Earth's past.
They look pretty docile.
We shall want a full autopsy ...
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Cuervo...?
He's... near.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Maybe. But you're not putting any shit in me this time.
Let's just say it's what's best for the country.
No.
Lock fuel rods.
75% power.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
Relax, war hero. We took you for a ride, and you came through. Not bad for a dirtbag like you.
No way.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
No screamin' shit.
Don't follow me.
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
Snake - what is it?
The freeway.
Where's the anti-toxin...?
All of us?
Is he coming?
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
My domain is here, inside this metal skin. And I would pledge to you all that I still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.
My salvation is to die a Knight of the Round Table.
Perceval, you have returned!
Of Merlin?
I want to thank you.
I love her. If she would be my queen, my dreams would be answered.
At your service, sir.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
The very spear that pierced the side of Christ as he died on the cross.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Why didn't he kill us?
The King without his sword, the land without a king...
Just a man. A knight in the King's service.
You provoke me, Merlin.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
I didn't know that.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
I see, your excellency.
It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.
Well, when I went to get the Thorazine I had him to stay with her and... Oh, I should of known better.
What did the doctor say?
Not that I know of.
Oh, I see.
Very sorry, but you see, no rats!
She is going to be well?
Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
Please go away.
So, how'd a shrink ever get to be a priest?
Sure did.
I didn't get you?
But how?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?
No.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Where's Regan's father?
Is she gonna die?
Oh look at that.
No you don't. I do it all the time.
No I do, Captain Howdy said no.
Yeah
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
You like him.
But you like him.
Cause Burke and I are just friends. Okay, really.
I don't want it.
Honey this is Father Dyer.
St. Mike's.
Where'd you get it then?
She seemed fine.
Sure.
I'm not Regan.
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
In here. With us.
It would bring us together.
Quod nomen mihi est?
Is that too tight?
We may ask what is relevant, but anything beyond that is dangerous. He is a liar, the demon is a liar. He will lie to confuse us. But he will also mix lies with the truth to attack us. The attack is psychological , Damien. And powerful. So don't listen, remember that, do not listen.
Save me o' God by thy name, by thy might defend my cause, proud men have risen up against me, men of violence seek my life, but God is my helper, the Lord sustains my life and every need he has delivered to me, glory be to the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.
As it was in the begin is now and ever shall be, world without end, amen.
The Lord be with you.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Yeah, a fall.
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
No, I mentioned it only in passing.
Who's in it?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Fuck him!!!
Twelve.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Look, Frankie.  You and Jack been playing here, a long time.
Maybe next time.
Well, look at this.
They're falling out.
No bones?
Two at a time?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
You're a real tough guy when the ladies are around, aren't you, Ace?
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Oh my God ...
Oh, look at you two.  So skinny. And those tiny suits ...
Out.
What's the gig?
Jack.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
I mean it, Jack.  Behave.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Fuck him.
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend.  Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
What do you think?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
I don't gotta go.
We don't get a gig.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Jack.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
See anything?
How about these?
Hey, Frank.
November.  '71.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
Pearls.  White gown.  Beautiful.
Right.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
What the hell are these?
He had to come quickly.  It was a big leak.
How come I didn't hear anything?
Expensive hangover.
Couple years.
A useless talent.
Not for me.  I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that?  Otherwise, I forget. I just forget.  But you.  You never forget. Ever.  So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
Yeah, but he told you things.  He never told me anything.  Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
Be reasonable, Jack.
What're you doing?
I don't know. Some disease.
We're on after Meadowlark.  What's wrong?
Right.
How're your hands?
So what'd you think?
The flu.
Candy Man.'  Is that all right?
Uh... he knows it.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
Yes, it is.
You're an hour and a half late.
I don't believe it.  I come all the way down down here, break a heel, and you're not gonna give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late.
So run a little longer.
Terrific.  Thirty-eight.
Ready?
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
What I mean is --
We're a team.  We work together.
Changed?
Is there a language problem here?  Your dress. For tonight.  Where is it?
Hey!
I wear a seven.
Nine?
Oh, thanks.
Right.
Hey!
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
Uh ...
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
Yes, sir.  That's quite a girl you boys latched onto.  She a local?
Born and bred.
Thanks.
The name's Baker --
Frank works hard.
And you don't?
Is that the way it is?
You never sang before?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Forget it.
How's egghead?
Like a baby. You?
I can keep the beat.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Look. You don't know good. All right?
Who's Nina?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
History.
Long story.
So, what happened?
Ma didn't want it around.  After.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
What kind?
Vegetables.
Hi.
It ain't always a blessing.  My brother here?
What happened to the donut king?
Is that what you used to do?
What are they?
Ivory.
Okay.  How'd yours go?
Sure.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
Yeah, real fine.  Especially all the casualties.
Try to kiss my butt just once before I'm transferred.
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
After that.  You promised you'd always take care of me.
I'm late for surgery.
No.
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie!  What could be more important than that?
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I took it from my fake husband.
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff.  I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
What do you mean?
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Would it?
Like gangbusters, doc.  Okay, I missed the last one.
-- Castor?
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
Oh, that Karl.
No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Hey Santa, where are you? Everybodys here.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Thats right. And auto supply...
Jack, are you okay?
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Very nice. What is it?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Is it...?
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Got a minute, Jack?
You just said everyone needs something.
Give me my goddamn life back!
How much time?!
Why not?
What're you talkin' about?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
I dont care who you are.  Its Christmas and like I told you the building is closed.
Dont  go, Jack...
Fine, shes the kids dog.  Lets go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
No, Im serious...youre really stunning...
She got those shoes...
Excuse me?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if Im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...Im sick of it.
Its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
Sure.  I really like Annie.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
Charles Street?  In the Village?  When we were living in Greenwich Village...?  Great times.  Whyd we ever leave?
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
Thank you...
And now...?
Youre so...beautiful...
This place is a perk, Kate.
I need you to remember me, Kate.  How I am right now, right this very moment.  I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
You look great.
Please. Lets just go have a cup of coffee. Thats all Im asking for. Im sure theres another flight to Paris tonight.
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
No...Im not...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
You didnt seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
I found it!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
I don't think She's real big on hate.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
Are you alright?
It's about to be a broken face.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Where...where am I?
What's wrong with me?
Ben, come in.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
This is wrong in so many ways.
Back it down, Johnny!
Is there something about flames? About flaming, that you --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
You're really cramping my style here.
Sweet.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
If Reed's right, then this little trip will double our stock offering.
They're ready for you, sir.
Then what is it?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
You back this mission, and I'll sign over a fair percentage of any applications or --
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
What are you doing here?
I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship --
That's what we're here to find out.
You should be able to bend light around other objects, even people, if you could control your emotional state better --
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Oh, I think you already have.
'Scuse me.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Where do we stand?
They've crossed over into the Jugular Vein!
They're in the Pulmonary Artery.
Now how soon can we try Sodium Pentathol?
We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
Looks like you didn't batten it down too well.
Then how come it worked loose?
You must carry spare parts --
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Doctor, what's wrong?
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
We can't take a second more.
What can we do?
I've done all I could with the laser.
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
How does it look, Doctor?
The ship's good as finished. We'll have to get out on our own! Is there a quick way out?
About forty miles an hour.
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
I saw the laser just before we started. It was fastened down securely. You don't suppose what happened was an 'accident?' Any more than my safety line snapping after it was tied off to the sub?
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Come on -- it's no use!
That's it...
Was there any damage?
The Wall's transparent...
What do you mean?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
I don't think so. It's nice.
I did.
Unguent.
No, that's not it, Jerry.
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Yah. Personal matters that needn't, uh -
...Blood has been shed.
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Any others?
Oh, yah, I know that!
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
Uh-huh.
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
My father-in-law, he's the owner.
...Mr. Lundegaard?
...Brainerd?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
We run a pretty tight ship here.
Yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
No, no, fax is -
Jerry Lundegaard.
Jerome Lundegaard?
Yah!  I... those are in the mail.
My patience is at an end.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Come by at 2:30 and we'll talk about it. If your numbers are right, Stan says its pretty sweet. Stan Grossman.
Yah, thanks, Stan, it's a pretty -
What the heck were you thinkin'? Heck, if I'm only gettin' bank interest, I'd look for complete security. Heck, FDIC. I don't see nothin' like that here.
... Stan, I'm thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
Ya see something down there, Chief?
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
...Geez.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Oh, pretty good.
...This is a nice place.
I'm sorry, Mike.
Well, I'm sorry I won't see ya.
Linda.
No.
Yah, Linda's fine. You should call her.
His wife. This guy says she was kidnapped last Wednesday.
Gustafson's accountant.
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah, okay. How's the hotel?
You shouldn't be on your feet too much, you got weight you're not used too. How's the food down there?
Three-cent stamp.
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
And this Shep Proudfoot character, he's a little darling. He's now wanted for assault and parole violation. He clobbered a neighbor of his last night and another person who could be one of your perps, and he's at large.
I'm tellin' ya.
There's no one else here.
We're still men.
Cornelius!  How are you?
No.  I found something new.
Really, what's that?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.
"The second rule of fight club... Is this yours?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
No, I wasn't aware...
Yes.  It left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. Do you know what that means?
Can't you give me something?
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
You take tuberculosis.  My smoking doesn't go over at all.
I'll take the parasites.
I want that.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
That's the idea -- we split them.
You haven't been going to yours.
It's for men.
So you're staying in tonight?
Guy or girl?
Why would you get bent if I asked?
He's not here.
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
Marla...
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
Tyler?
Oh, yeah.
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Is this a test, sir?
We have front row seats for this Theater of Mass Destruction.  The Demolitions Committee of Project Mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  In two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  I know this because Tyler knows this.
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
This is how I met --
Well, uh... great.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
God, it's late.  I should find a hotel...
A hotel?
What's that?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
They're called "cigarette burns."
Is it?
Call what off?
Doesn't matter.
Yeah, I'm sure.
You're okay with this?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What... ?
Hey.
Something on your mind?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
Why do people think anything?
Is this really news to you?
What are you talking about... ?
What about Marla?
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
Fuck you.
What?
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
Did I tell you I'd call you a fascist dickhead?!
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Okay!  Okay, fuck it!  Use the basement!  Get off me!
Animals.
I didn't beat it; I hid from it. If you were smart you'd put a down payment on a burial plot and say goodbye to the dog, because what little life you have left is over as you know it.  Don't make new friends, don't fall in love, and don't ever bother trying to save others.  That's the worst killer of them all.
Six duds in a row.
What did you see?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
Damn, they always stick me with the clunker.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Guys, let's not panic.  Isabella's safe.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.
That... him?
How many died on Flight 180?  From our group?
4:25.
Right. April 25th.
Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
I don't.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
Again.
Ninety.
Show me how it operates.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
You read me, Brewer?
You wanna know why I stood up for this show?
Buddhist monastery.  Fifteenth century.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Brewer.  Does a jet make noise?
That guy's not going to make it.
Brewer!  You know what that thing's packing?
I have arranged transportation.  We meet soon.  But I think you to be disappointed.
Thanks.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
Memo E-7 on top will cover the details.  An abandoned Vietnamese Army base in the North-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  As you can see the intelligence is soft.  These LANDSAT photos show huts... barracks.  It could be anything.
He's giving them a run for their money.  Says here they've got two Hueys from Danang.  I didn't know those dinks had Hueys.
What?
I know...
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
It's not over.  You made one mistake.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
Let's do it.
But now it's free, right?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Really?
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
I'm sorry.
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
The moron?
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  He'll snap out of it?
I'm afraid not ... Then again, I'm not sure. The beating's bad but it's not the problem... It seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... So, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....I don't know. There's no way to tell.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Uh... basement I think...
Can I help you?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Oh, Lydia!
My name is Parry.
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this.  Isn't he fabulous!?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
What are we about to do?
No.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Now, now.
I'm not some piece a crap.
What?
It brings out my eyes...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
No.
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
No. How much do I owe you?
I don't make the rules.
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Why? Am I some kind of freak to you or something?
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
It's none of your business!
Where's Catherine?!
Bye, now.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
If you're free.
None.
No, don't do that...
That's right.
Is he?
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
What?
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
Catherine...
Just give me a chance, will you?
And living out here, in this rest home asylum, that's what you want?
Oh, for chrissakes...
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Well...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Pardon me?
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
God, you drive me crazy. I just want you to know how I feel and you don't understand.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
What are you doin' here?
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
You got a boyfriend?
She lives near Eddie?
How old is he?
You gonna talk to him?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Positive.
How do I know you're not lying.
Not really.
Jus' from around the way.
You live around here?
So he's going. Uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.
I have no idea.
I ought to get some sleep.
Hey you're really nuts.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. I've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
So where do you know Alan from?
No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I think Id rather have drugs.
Jesus.
I'm serious, Sam.
Gum thought Brazil.
I'm fine.
This was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.
I guess not.
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
I don't know what you're referring to. Wendy maintains her own residence.
I empathize with your plight, Fletch. However, you threw her out.
Sure did. Dropped the big one on them.
Right.
Right.
God, I haven't seen you since the wedding.
I couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, but the announcer talked to fast and I couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so I figured if I came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, I missed you.
Don't call me Fletch. Don't look at me. Lie back down. We'll talk.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Why not?
Because we can't.
Are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Cute young thing, too.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours.
I bet you do.
Alan's in Utah.
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
I saved his life during the war.
Your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
Good point.
What is this?
What does all this mean?
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
No. You can't. Look, I know you don't know me from Adam, but you've got to trust me.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
No... I've got to go to Mr. Underhill...
I'll take you to a game.
I thought you had this all figured out. Good going 'Irwin.'
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
Fletch.
Uh, almost.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
No it's not okay. You have to have this in by tomorrow. Did you see the ad we ran Sunday?
I never read the paper.
Now, Irwin, try to follow me. You can't run the ad and then not run the story.
Who?
Well, there we're in a gray area.
Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here.
More cops.  I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank.
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
Fletch, you want an apology?
Frieda's boss.
Who's Frieda?
Yes?
But I ain't got you...
Colleen and Johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
So you know about Johnny Crunch and myself.
So you...
I'll do my best.
I've heard cars fuck with more harmony.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
How'd you get this from her?
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
After their initial investment in the factory, Grendel didn't need them.  Told them to fuck off. They tried to get these C.D.s together in order to have proof of Grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  Now's the fun part...
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
Why are all these people after me?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Pretty smooth, huh?
I can't kill this kid's father...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
I'm sorry...
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane.  He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it.  After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
Off what?  Twenty seconds...
Well, hello, Ford.
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
What's my name?
No - no.
Boca?
Where are you?
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Did you ever sit on the edge of the bed, take off your socks and stick your fingers between your toes?
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Where's he from?
Morning.  Sometime.
That's crazy.  You lost the Frog in the subway and you blew our cover. If they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
Who stuck up the laundromat?
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
Whatta you say we wait and give him a tail?
Monica?  Who's Monica?
What happened to you?
My ass.  The only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
Can you use a new suit for Christmans?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
What is that old building?
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
No, I don't.
That's Deleon and Hayes' collar.
Just missed Deleon.  Hayes is up in the squad.
Wish I was.  Oldest part of the system down there.  We're on it, but it's gonna take awhile.
Baltimore?
Hey, Rookie.  Be cool.  Just stay with me.  This is what we do.
How about a little of the King?
He did.
Honey, what is it?  Just tell me.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Let's go outside and talk.  We need to do that.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
Frank, this is insane...
Looks like two weeks worth of allowance, Chief.
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Where are you transmitting from?
I don't really follow baseball anymore.
What are you talking about?  I'm talking about this afternoon.
Sorry 'bout that.
What'd you just say?
Right...and I'm asking how you called the game.
Yeah, that's how Hams work.
You sound...ground up...?
It's really you, isn't it?
No wait, don't go!
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, it's me.
She's not here.
There was this case.  A serial.  He murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  The papers called them the Nightingale Murders.  They never caught him.  But the killings just stopped.
Something we did changed the case...changed history.  Mom wasn't dead.  But then after you didn't die in the fire something must have happened.  And this guy, this Nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
No.  I just kept talking to her.  There was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
Yeah, you betcha.
What?
John, you there?
What's wrong?
The warehouse.  Buxton seeds.  It's tomorrow.
My father didn't die in a fire?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
Okay, lemme walk you through it.
So you figure the murders stop 'cause he's off the street.  Then by the time he gets paroled, he's smartened up enough to control himself?
He ain't our guy, John.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Yeah.  I just wish I'd told her how proud I was of her.
Hell-
What're you gonna do?
Do you want a beer or not?
You can say... "Hello, how are you?"... for starters.
Just slow down.  Let me get to know you again.  Let me get to know this place again.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Why did you come back here?
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
My whole world.
Faster!  Eat faster!
Why don't you help us?
Come on, Shelly.  Who else is gonna give him a lift?
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
You've just learned a valuable lesson.  A beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
Who's Horace?
Darren, we better turn around.
Why?
That's right.  Just drive toward him.  He'll move.  Nobody wants to die.
That's a freakin' fact.  Least of all us.
You just sit tight, Jason.  Once the authorities from Carpenter get here, you'll...
Of course not.  If he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, I'm sure he's lost.
Never should've let her play.
What it is?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
...Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
I can't believe no one called back.  I better...
Okay, okay.  I suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by Colonel Mustard, with the knife.
What's goin' on?
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
And you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
Why didn't you cremate him?!
You're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
I sympathize with you kids.  The best I can do is call the station in Carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
Diana -- you heard from Jessica lately?
So let's talk.
You know he's not...and he's coming for you.
What do you want?
Okay.  So how is Jessica?  You talked to her lately?
Careful, Chief.  I don't think you know who I am.
Why did you want her body?
For a good reason.
Lock this asshole up.
Is this Anthony?...Yeah, well, I just have one question for you, Anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
Randy, c'mon!
Wanna know how I did that?
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
Never.
Steven!
I'm literally going to kill you!
Ten dollars! Hell, I can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
Yeah.
Right.
Where's the radio?
Christ...where's Rennie??
Dear Christ...
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.
You have no right...
She doesn't know what she wants. She's never had a stable life.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.
She didn't push me into coming.
Facing your fear doesn't always conquer it.
You had me worried to death!
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.
Yes...
Rennie...
Hi, Sean.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
Rennie...what'd they do to you??
I opened thousands of brains.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
It's over, finished and done with.
Asbestos lining.
You mean because What's-His-Name.
I'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm a man who loves life.
Paisley Porter.
Let's work on it.
This could Pbe it.
Our Peter?
The Red Sox
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Take it yourself. Take a date.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
What do we want?
Your father said you might be here.
The whole thing is my fault. I took unfair advantage of your patience and understanding. You understand me.
That's always been my problem.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
Washed away.
What did it say?
Go way. I'll call a cop.
What do you want?
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
You know the answer to that.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
You'll need these. Tonight. For the play.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Because God loves a winner.
All the times I died when the Red Sox lost an important game they should have won. All the awful things I said to my mother and father. To Tmy wife and daughter.
Washed away.
When I traveled through Asia this summer, I went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so I could call up Sports Phone in New York and get the scores. I drove through the war in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.
Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here to announce the death of civilization. He kills a play every time he farts.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
How come?
Why?
I have excellent long-term memory.
Yes.
This is your history, isn't it? Nicky? All around us. And my parasite is consuming it.
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
A little.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
Elliot wants to kill him with a railroad spike.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
He wears a disguise.
He's a very sweet man.
Yes.
I haven't come to you.
Oww!
Sora was sent to tell me I -- I must rake and cover the latrine.
God gave you ten thumbs.
What was he like?
Lots of hair... and a little like a college freshman -- trying to figure everything out.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
If we obtain our freedom by murder and bloodshed I want no part of it.
You've done me a great service.
Good.  Ba will have to teach you to spin too.
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
They are preparing for war. I will not support it, but I do not intend to take advantage of their danger.
Allah be praised. And what battalions will you call upon?
It's split the Government.
Perhaps some tea?
You're an extraordinary man.
Have you read his magazine?
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, <i>this</i> is your man.
According to this, he's a sick man.  Congenital heart condition.  Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
What a pity.
We're in the wrong place.  We're wasting time.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
Thank you, no.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Six one.
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  You are a disappointment, Jerome.
That's not the point.
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
It's okay, Eugene.
Where?
In a corridor.
I don't feel too good.  I think I'm still drunk from last night.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Will you be okay?
How long?
How the hell did you get here.
Anything I've forgotten?
You can wear lifts.
You worried about the cost?
Were <i>you</i> alone?
I envy you, Jerome.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Let's walk.
--when you go away.
I've got enough here.
I can't do this.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I guess it was because I was a model prisoner.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
I'll take care of my end.
I knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when I was 8.
That's not all of it.
After four years and now the question comes up.
Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
How was it?
You were asleep.
Is he straight?
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Do you mean that?
You're full of ifs.
Maybe. At least I got to him.  Where do we go from here?
No scars?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
I'll be ready.
Get in the shower. You'll feel okay.
How long before this car's hot?
What now?
Gonna knock down a wall?
I'm good at that.
How was that?
Where we go in1?
Is it possible, Mrs. Clinton?
What kind of car do you have, Harold?
The three of us are going to do some traveling. We're going to take your car to El Paso.
I've got to stop.
I made a mistake.
Jack, you're wrong.
Jack?
Confidential, like.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
What?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
No. I didn't know that.
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Expect so.
Did my brother Frank find out?
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
It's a bloody funny thing. You know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle Jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  It's a bloody funny thing.
Thanks for coming.
How's school?
Where you going to live, then?
Where's that?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
Don't know.
You work here, Keith?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight.  Nice surprise, isn't it?
I'm staying with a friend.
Are you a traveller?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Funny.  Can I phone London?
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
Now just a minute...
They bloody hurt me.
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What you going to do?
Are you tired?
Jack Carter.
Oh, that's nice.
What are you doing? Advertising Martini?
That's not always a healthy way to be...
Making a living.
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Of course, of course. Well, any time, just drop by.
We've got to take you back to London.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
They do that up North.
What's that?
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
Mmm...
Some contest board...
For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
The nurses?
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
No, it's not that simple, Dave...
Of doing the thing.  The dif...the difference.  Between me and Jerry Graff.  Going to business for yourself.  The hard part is...you know what it is?
What?
...you're absolutely right.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should rob the office.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
What will he pay?
What if you don't get caught?
They come to you, you going to turn me in?
Why would I do it?
Yes.  I'm sure.
That's ridiculous.
Then tough luck, George, because you are.
Well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here I'm a criminal...
You went for it.
Can we get some coffee...?
Uh-huh.
Then, you know, they wouldn't be so ups...
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
Were the leads...
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Wh...wh...Wha...?
...Come in here...I work here, I don't come in here to be mistreated...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Just go to lunch.
Go to lunch, George.
Excuse me, sir...
Oh, fuck.  Fuck.  FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!! WILLIAMSON!!!  OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
What about the other two?
Four.  You had four leads.  One kicked out, one the judge, you say...
...then what is this "you say" shit, what is that?  What is that...?
Under him?
...after the thirtieth...
You're saying that I'm fucked.
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
Yes.
I can't close these leads, John. No one can.  It's a joke.  John, look, just give me a hot lead. Just give me two of the premium leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a "test" and I promise you...
And fifty bucks a lead.
You fucking asshole.  I haven't got it.  I haven't got it, John.  I'll pay you tomorrow.  I'm coming in here with the sales, I'll pay you tomorrow.  I haven't got it, when I pay, the gas...I get back the hotel, I'll bring it in tomorrow.
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
What does that fucking mean?
You are?
You said, "You don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  How did you know that I made it up?
I told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
Was it?
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Abso...
The check's no good?
Shit.
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
...the fuck is that supposed to mean...?
"You do get the..."  Huh?  Huh?
Dave...
When?
They took the leads?
Like you taught me...
The hell with him.  We'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Oh!  For the magazine...
Rick...?
Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...
What do I...?
Well, let's have a couple more.  My name is Richard Roma, what's yours?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
Three days.
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
And when was that check cashed?
Tell me again.  Your wife.
I...
I...
The deal.
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here...let's go get a drink.
Mountain View.  Eight units.
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Guess who?
We haven't got a lead...
Why not?
They didn't get my contracts.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
Where are you going?
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
...Mr. Williamson...
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
Why do you have to go?
To do business.
I was taller than you when I was fourteen.
I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it.
Your friend lives in a fine building.
They say Fanucci has a license from Maranzalla himself to work this neighborhood.
I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late.  This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle?
Yes, thank you.
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
Tom is right.
Goddamn bitch.
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
He is weak.
I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh...
We were all upset about that.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
That's what I'm here for.
It was hard to have him killed.
...Who?
Fredo.  Where are you going?
There's nothing more you can tell me about this investigation?
Why?  Why does he bother other Italians?
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Goddamn it, where were you?
Mikey, I hoped...
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
That plane goes to Miami...
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down.
Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
There's thirty grand worth of paid off markers -- I never owed that much.
Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record.
Is he related to the witness?
Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable.
Whose orders are these?
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Why don't you sit down?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?
Pentangeli is a dead man; do you object?
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
How is his health?
The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you.
This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this?
Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state?
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
I know.
Sure, Mike.  I'll go along.
Rosato, where's your brother?
What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits?
I'm talking about Italians!
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Fuck you.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It never crossed your mind?
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
You and he are not doing things?
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Or would you prefer a beer?
This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
What did she mean by going flooey?
What was wrong?
Huh?
Broke is more like it.
You don't say?  Which picture?
Sounds like something you feed the dog.
No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
All right, I guess.
Is this David's doing?
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name.
Can I see what you did so far?
Not fear.  More like disgust.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy.
Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone?
Who's that?
Is that really her?
Is that --?
A very lucky thing indeed.
You know what he did when I called him?  He laughed.  He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  Said it was a good lesson for me.  Not to try to fill his shoes.
But that was so long ago.  It can't still bother you.
All right.  Let's take it off now.
I can undress myself, thank you.
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.
She tells me you haven't been sleeping well.
You remember how a production eats up one's life.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
Then who did?
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know?
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
Yeah -- ?
Sound it out for me.
You know my back -
You want to come along quiet?
How's Atley -- ?
Let them go --
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
And this has what to do with me?
I know you.
Who is it -- ?
What's this -- ?
What for?
No particular reason. Catch a Laker game. I heard we got Shaquille ...
C'mon, Donny... Let's go, man --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
What color?
Damn. Memphis Raines. Long time ...
How's it going -- ?
A bunch of strung-out hypes and stick- up men. This ain't like the old days, Memphis. The profession has lost its..
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
What do you say, Toby?,
You goin' home?
Hey, Kip ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
Hey, you want something to eat ?
"About what?"
You spread it out ... you move around... So's they can't touch you... so's they don't know... Shadow games and shit ...
What about just getting a job, 9 to 5, five days a week, that whole mystery achievement -- ?
Nah.
You know of one -- ?
On account of Mitch?
I left town. I didn't leave you.
She's trouble --
Stop. What about Maserati Boy?
Slip it in ...
Woo-woo-wooooo!
Cut 'em...
Now... I'm in ...
You're still quite the boost, Randall Raines ...  Except now I've been chopped, and my parts are in a Honda Prelude being driven to church in South America by some Bolivian consulate's wife ...
How is he -- ?
You okay -- ?
This time it's for real?
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
You're gonna be okay, Toby... You are ... We'll getcha fixed up...
You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great.  He made mirrors.
No more shines, Billy.
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
Take it easy.  We can talk about it.
What bag?
The bag with the envelopes.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
What did he say, exactly?
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
We got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
What?
Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
Nah.
I didn't agree to three points over the vig.- What am I nuts? I didn't need it that much.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
You ready?
I gotta go home.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
Don't start. I told you to clean up. Look at this place. It's a pigpen. Look around here. Why do you think I bought you the dishwasher? Look. Look at this.  There's enough powder around here to put us all away.
I hate to do dishes.
He didn't call?
You want a partner?
You guys know my cousin Mikey Sullivan?
Probation, counselin', few days a week.
Oh I'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Okay.
I'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of Harvard people.
I guess so.
What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
--That isn't funny--
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Come on, Will...
Holy shit.
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
What're those?
What's that?
Good to meet you.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Sean.
This kid's special, Sean. I've never seen anything like him.
Yeah.
And he mailed it to Hardy--
I think so.
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
He married his cousin.
Who?
You see, Sean? That's exactly not the point. No one remembers that. They--
I do.
Just...take it easy, Gerry.
Look, you took one road and I took another. That's fine.
--And confuse him--
--And why does he hang out with his friends? Because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. It's called loyalty!
Now don't do that. Don't you do that! Don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. That it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! If you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
So I hear you're taking some time.
I don't know. India maybe.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
There is somebody...
Like what, Will?
I go places, I interact.
What?
That's very presumptuous.
Buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
You think so?
Nautilus?
No.
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
You've never been out of Boston.
Hence, the word remarried.
Why not?
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
Where were you?
I guess.
Define that.
That's what I'm saying, Will. You'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
I been there. I played my hand.
I know.
See ya.
Yeah?
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
No...I was hoping to get a kiss.
How was that?
Do you know all their names?
Sorry. I'm sorry. Give me another crack at it. Let me take you out.
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
All right, all right. We'll go.
Clearly.
Just for fun?
Will? Are you awake?
No.
And you're sure about that?
Why not?
Is that what you think--
At least you have a mother.
What the fuck am I afraid of?!
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
She'll prob'ly ride like a bull calf-- but she'll ride!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ready, Pa?
That comes from not holdin' you tight *enough.*
What a place! How'd you like to walk acrost her?
People done it. If they could, we could.
She's hotter'n a heifer.
We just picked him up on the way in. He went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.
Short fella. Pale face.
Want to work?
Kids?
Two.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Crate fell on me.
At my meetin's I used to get the girls glory-shoutin' till they about passed out. Then, I'd go to comfort 'em--and always end up by lovin' 'em. I'd feel bad, an' pray, an' pray, but it didn't do no good. Next time, do it again. I figgered there just wasn't no hope for me.
I never let one go by me when I could catch her.
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
Excuse me for asking.
What you figger to do?
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Women is always tar'd.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
You know what I mean. You been givin' me a goin' over ever since I got in. Whyn't you go on and ask me where I been?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
How 'bout Granma?
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
Ma... you know, if Connie was here I wouldn't min' any a this.
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
You'll *what*?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Pa! Shh!
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Look, Ma!
Since before they stopped us las' night.
Get some sugar too, for the coffee.
Looks like you done it.
I kinda thought so. Felt like it.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
This here's a fifteen-cent loaf.
You can have this for ten cents.
But who done it?
Brother, I don't know. If I did I'd tell you. But I just don't know *who's* to blame!
Got that desert yet. Gotta take her tonight. Take her in the daytime fella says she'll cut your gizzard out.
She's jus' wore out, that's all.
Maybe it's nice on the other side. Them pitchers--them little pos'cards-- they was real pretty.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
I wisht it was day.
Come on. Ain't nobody gonna say anything.
Jes' like in the catalogues, ain't they!
Awright. An' if she gets outa han', I'll be in the right han' corner, this side the dance floor.
What do you do?
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky.
Computer guy.
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
I want to be an actor.
I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning.
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Tell me about yourself.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Watched television?
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Flowers. That's funny.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
Like love?
He was trying to kill you, right!
Is it something you've done?
Jesus Christ!
Will you come with me?
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
Wait a minute--
No...
I have scruples. Next.
I bought a new rug.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it?
So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
Shit.
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Son?
How did you meet her?
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
Why don't you go lie down?
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
Yeah?
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
How long is this going to go on?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Who's going to want me now?
What?
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No, let me go.
How was the dinner?
Yeah.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
She will if you think she should.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
Was the trip okay?
Where to?
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Play that sweet one you know. The one makes my wife here so friendly.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
I don't believe it.
Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Of course I have.
Isn't it like, obvious?
I thought your mom's coming up?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Did you notice -- no cane?
You just showing off for her!
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Long enough.
What stuff is that?
About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
You think it's cool?
Secret Service!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
What's that?
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Oh wow, we are fried.
Go fix the phones.
And what's he do?
You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade?  Right, Dade?!
That's bullshit.
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Talk to me.
Game's over. Last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  You're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
Make it our first date.
We need your help.
Thank you.
You what?
There they are!
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
Ready?
What?
You know, I've been having these really weird..
Hello?
Joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. Junk. Bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
Hey, it's me.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Congratulations.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Send a Flu-shot.
Thank you.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
You think she stands a chance?
Is there another key?
What does that mean?
Brady!
Shit!
Mom, please
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
Night Doc.
We're going to Ben's. The phone never just rings at a police station.
Shit, Earl. It's Ted Holster.
Like a real sister?
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
It was the nightmare man
Jamie, wait for me.
We'll hear sirens soon.
Then we'll be safe?
Kelly, I want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
I didn't know you and Brady had anything okay?
I don't want to look pushy.
The Corruther's house. That's where Jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
Do you?
Go to my house. We'll call the state force from there.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
He's been here.
Oh Christ. Doc...
Where's that Deputy?
How's it powered?
Your hunting it, ain't ya? Yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
It's been totally charted.
Saving the treats for Bob?
I'M baby sitting for the Doyles. It's only three houses away. We can keep each other company.
Look where?
Of course.
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?
I wasn't spooked.
What's the pumpkin for?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Yes, you can.
Now... First we'll talk a little, then Annie will distract Lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. Got it?
Is that all you say?
He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
You're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
Exactly what do you need?
They could be.
Hi, Laurie, what's up?
Yes, I am.
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
What did he look like?
Right.
I'm scared...
Of course not.
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
What did you use before?
If you say so.
What did he say?
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Oh, is that what it is?
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Uh...
What?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, Elliot!
Yes.  Yeah, I-I'm kill--
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Page a hundred and twelve.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh, you-you have that one?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
I-I, I'm sorry.  I know it's terrible.
But not over me?
Poor Hannah.
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
Lee...
You bet.
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
I didn't say that.
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
Are you?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER  You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
Why should I be afraid?
Are you sure?
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
But not you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
I know, I know, and your hamster.
So how are you?
Really?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Oh!
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Oh!
Hey!
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Yeah.
Don't you think she does?
Oh, he's such a loser!
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Ohh!
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Oh, no.
Well...
Probably not.
Really?
No, the reason I ask is--
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Oh, it just came to me one day.
Right.
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Uh-huh.
I'm on the track of a reward, which...
They're offering... 
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
You've gone off to America, on your <u>Vacation</u>...
It's a growth business.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
He said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because I was civil.
We got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
We could skip the Gavotte.
Then who's buying it?
Evelda Drumgo.
What's new onna street?
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
...nightmare.
They got that kind of money?
Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?
Seen what, sir..?
..It won't be long now, sir...
He... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  To a charitable institution of your choice. 
What reaction?
Exactly.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
Let the girl go.
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Starling...?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed...?  What <u>is</u> this...?
Just a moment.  Starling didn't...
I said how's your baby...?
I have had many excellent meals there.
My mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
Of course, Commendatore...
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
You looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Well, I don't want to starve them too long.  They die.
And you let her get away.
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
What is that that smells so wonderful.
Freud, do you know...?  Freud psychoanalyzed patients in One Afternoon.
It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind.  What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone?  When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
...might I make a suggestion...?
Look what they put her on...
The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo.  The man's hazing you.
My daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
What broke <u>you</u> free, Girl?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
No.
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
...my love...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Because...?
Hello....?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
Yeah, I'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
What're they on about?
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
...no...
If <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
...sir...?
Now what? What did I do this time?
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.

Eric...You can't be like me. You have to be better. I'm not the guy you think I am...
Go stand by the flagpole.
Your Secret admirer?
Wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. The kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. We shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.

Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?
Iunno.
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.
Take a break Veronica, sit down.
Hey Veronica, how'd that Teenage Prevention T.V. Suicide thing go?
Things are going to change, Earl.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
You wanted to become a member of the most powerful clique in the school. If I wasn't already the head of it, I'd want the same thing.
God, they won't expell him. They'll just suspend him for a week or something.
Don't worry. We'll work something out.
Just shut up and turn on the radio. Hot Probs is on.
Probably....
Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
Really? That thing in the caf today was pretty severe.
Just a humble perk from my Dad's Construction company or should I say Deconstruction company?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Hey, it was good for me too, Sparky.
Just saying it's not hard to end a life.
Good plan.
What are you <u>doing</u>? You just can't go.....Besides, she'd never drink anything that looks like that.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
I'm just a little freaked, all right?  You got what you wanted, you know.
Adolescence is a period of life fraught with anxiety and confusion.
She missed "myriad" on a vocab test two weeks ago, all right?
Mute!
What is this shit?
You can be so immature!
Let's just...settle down. Ms. Fleming has given us a chance to atone for...
We're breaking up. I am out!
Okay, okay. I knew that. I knew that. Put your hands on your head.
It's all over, J.D. Help me to stop it.
Just push the red button twice. That's what stops it. If that's what you want, babe?
We on tonight man?
Turn that back on!
That's three things.
But my name's not...
I've never cottoned on to Plasticine like you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I'd better be getting back. Bye, love.
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have it.
Look, Mother!
gives her a sympathetic look.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
You're such an incredible woman.
I'm coming with you.
Isn't it beautiful!
Are you a dream too?
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing...
It's inside a moving car.
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Yeah, how's that?
I have my connections
I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
How much time off?
I've been in here before.
I said she's been missing for-
Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment.
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
Shut up and play darling. Your turn.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
What evidence?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Do you know where you are?
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Whew. You bounce right back don't you?
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
A lotta people wouldn't have tried. It was pretty brave even trying...
LaPlante!
That's close enough.  It's a confession.  The truth.  Jesus, I'm sorry, LaPlante.  I had the shoe, you said you didn't want, publicity because of your legal problems.
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
On the deposition for the jUdge, Bernie... I mean there's no way I can promise anything.  I can't tell him what we're up to...
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
I got your bail continued.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
The thing is, Chick.  I'm goin' down.
I...
Bill, I got some legal problems and I...
He waited for you three hours!
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Camera, Chucky.  Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir?  What is your relationship with John Bubber?
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
The cops!  What kinda bullshit is this?  Is this America or -- ?
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Oh yeah?  A hero, huh?  Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better.  Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy?  Well, the thing about life is...  it gets weird.  See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit .  Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another.  So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's <u>your</u> bullshit, so to speak.  You got that?
I know the truth, John.  I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow.  Interviewing them live on network hookup!
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
He's gotta be a nut!  He saves all those people and swipes a <u>purse</u>?
Upset!  What's he upset about?
Quit?  She wants to quit?
Gale shoulda aired that bit first, she's the one who found this clown LaPlante!  She let Channel Eight get a beat on us.
He lost a shoe!
My father didn't have his shoes on when he... when he came here.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?
Hey, c'mon.
Any particular brand?
Oh no -- I mean, she's genuinely made me more fulfilled in many ways -- and I hope eventually to be able to teach her a few things, too.  What I mean is, I guess I'm still waiting for just that right -- synthesis between us -- where everything will be understood between us without even the need for words.
You have to put yourself out there a bit more.
I can't help you if you don't help yourself.  It's really up to you. Brooding endlessly isn't going to help matters any.
Well, can I make an appointment?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
An occupational hazard, I'm afraid.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
I've asked him what's wrong.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I could take a cab on the way home.
No, honey, I haven't seen him. Didn't you feed him this morning?
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Honey --
Stop knowing me so well.
How were we -- were we cool?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
How was your lunch with Charlie?
Oh -- great.
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Where should I hide the car keys?
I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
You're even sadder and more burnt- out than I thought.
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
Are we gonna buy this house?
If you want that baseball jacket for your birthday, Neil, learn to cough a little more realistically.
And I can't help having a cold.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Is it a king or a queen?
Lieutenant?
What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
What do you think?
They appear to be authentic.
That's not all, Lieutenant.  Wait until you see the tape.  It's unbelievable.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
A few days ago.
Where were you last night around nine?
Around.
No.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
I'm sure they will.
How long is the voyage?
To ask her to dance.
Can you really tell from doing that?
This cannot be.
I would like to say goodbye.
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
Then take me with you.
Are you a cop?
A lucky guess.
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Do you always walk around with a sword?
New York is dangerous place.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
I'm interested in mythology.
Have you told Lieutenant Bedsoe your theory?
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.
Must you fight him?
He's fine.  He swears he never left his post for a moment.  He heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Why did you wait?
I know.
You kept it?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
My dreams died long ago.
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
I guess so.
Fuck guessing.  You keep your mouth shut.
The cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in Beverly Hills.  The phone company shows no unusual --
And by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
Everyone knows what we look like, Dennis. We won't be able to hide.
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
Mr. Kim didn't make it, Dennis.  He died.
What?
The one and only.  We got a little problem out here, Dennis.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Use more ice.
Who gives a shit, Mars?  Check out the cash!  We're rich.
That's right.  That's a good idea, Mars.
Find something:  Extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
What if it goes south?
Fuck the mall.  You know that motel on the road west of town?
You sure?
Ow!  Shit!
You leave that gun alone!
Shh, they'll hear you!
He's just knocked out.  I've been knocked out.
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
Dennis and Mars are in the den.  I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
That's enough.
One at a time!  Clear the air!  Louise?  Talk to me.  What do we have?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Sounds like you know the job.
Then get your men off the wall!  You breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  I <u>know</u> this guy, Captain -- I can talk to him.
I'm looking for you.  I need your tactical unit.
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
What's my name?
What?
Okay.
If I get Rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
Who is it?
What happened?
No. But I fear it's intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the Hutu Militia and the Tutsi rebels.
Yes we have.
Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the Minister of Finance.
Anything. Strong.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Will you protect us.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
The police are very busy.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
We are better here.
Very good.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
They moved you from the Diplomat?
Promoted. House Manager.
I need one last favor. Go back and get the twins.
I will need a suite.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Do something.
Go out! Where?
I had you transferred to Kigali.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
What's wrong?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
Twelve are dead.
Why the hurry, Roger?
Please, papa, I have a secret path.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
What are you playing here, Price?
I'm sorry --
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
Hey! Where'd you guys go?
I'll meet you down there.
Is she...alright?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
-- that's the fact, bud --
Don't think it's even an issue.
Where did it go?
You okay?
What?
Melissa Margaret Marr, Celebrity.
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
-- the sadistic prick --
-- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive --
-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
Vannacutt!!
I was upstairs!
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
-- it wasn't me.
No idea. I didn't even know the damn thing still worked!
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
You should really open this place to the public, Pritchett -- a spa for people without enough stress in their lives.
Melissa...?
Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
Something....happened --
What's the matter?
We don't have proof of that.
What will they tell you?
I'm sorry.
Well then who did?!
It's going to hurt us!
Honey, isn't your friend's name Colleen?
H-how long will it take?
She says she's lonely...
He's blessing the house.
Well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I'll have to call her.
I just, I don't know...
No.  Maybe it was Aubrey.
Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
Oh my God where is she!
She's gone!
Do you think I'm a fool?
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
So what does that have to do with Aubrey!  Where is she!
I didn't do anything...God saved her...
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.
I see some faint lettering.  It appears to be the...Runic alphabet?
What?
Yeah?  Well, you just struck out.  It may be a surprise to you, Brad, but I want to do it the right way.  Not tight skirts.  Tight stories.
Right.  Like last night's doozie.
He'll do what he does best.  But he'll do it unfettered.  He wants to walk the Earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
Then tell me what to do.
Sorry.  It was my father's.  It's temperamental.
... but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can ...
Every day.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
Buying some drugs, alright?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.
No.  We want ...
You gonna buy?
You're JP Monroe, right?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable...  Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.
That's your definition of "Hard?"
So Mr. Coffee, what went down outside the prison?
It's Captain Bob's steering wheel! Remember when the Captain.....
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
Cameras?
The song's over!  Come on! "You could be swinging on a star."
Boing.  Uh, this I don t understand...
Come on, Pierre, Steak-bur-ger, Fren-n-ch Fries.  This is France, you gotta have French.....
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
I betrayed a man.  A good man.  An innocent man.  A thief.
I'm sorry for losing it back there, but you must remember, sister, you have vows to God as well as a mission to the world.
Come on, this stuff will knock you out.  Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.
Whoa, part 2.  Does it go to Times Square?
Actually I wrote it.  It's a good sentence.  It can apply to people.
You're not an unmysterious thang yourself.
I was the Warden?
How long were you in?
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
It's that kind of selfish attitude that...
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House.  Easy as my brother's wife.  Directions are in the bag.  Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
Outbid by my own wench, quelle bummere.
Remember that shoe you lost...
Anybody have a cigarette?  But seriously, do me a favor and Concorde me back to prison.  I don't care anymore.  I hope you have the receipts for the threads.
But I'm not the type of guy to hold a grudge.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
We blow up space shuttles for breakfast.  You and your friend Alex would be a late afternoon Triscuit.
The Hoopsucker!
About seven minutes.
You're from Muncie?!
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Now, Aim --
Now, Amy --
Ya know, entry level!
...Geez.
I --
Yeah, but, buddy --
Awwww, buddy --
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
Geez, I --
...This'll only take a moment.
I'm brushing up on my French with the most charming man, Pierre of Fifth Avenue. Do you know him?
Tell him I'll be right there...  Well, what is it?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
She must have been beautiful.  What happened to her, Alma?
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
That's nonsense, Alma.
You mean a figurehead.
Mrs. Rand...
I've never heard of a cure.
You're single?
I like her already.
Perhaps you ought to get on to the mill.
I wish I hadn't heard --
She hated sleep.  She used to say it was a thief -- stealing away her life, an hour at a time...
You know what she is!  That's death -- no mind, no senses -- no love, no hate, no feeling -- nothing!
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
Don't take it to heart, Betsy.
To the asylum?
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Are you going to lie for him, Mother?
And speaking of which, you have those market share charts Mr. Shackley was asking about?
Right o'.
Darned right. Look here, Benj, whaddya make of this sequel to The Godfather? You think it's gonna work?
OK, OK, the defense rests.  Want another?
I wasn't star--
So maybe you'll come too?
You all right there?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
You've...
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Uh, dad, you know I'm 16.
It's like farming. I am basically chewing up large tracts of expensively landscaped scenery with overpriced sticks, and George Clair has obviously, in the mere two years since he joined the firm, he has obviously been taking secret lessons with a golf pro, and I assume the entirety of his disposable income has been devoted to humiliating me on the golf course. And the guy talks - incessantly -- throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes - on topics that are the supposed domain of my department --
Here.
Maybe it's all for the better, you know? Yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, I mean, have you noticed anything?
What?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
-- 73
What?
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
A key party?
Thank you Janey.
You want coffee or something?
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
It's not a bother.
Forget what?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Where you going?
What?
Huh?
Just be careful.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
The Idiot?
Maybe you should have just a half.
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
I do.
Right. Cool. So, how about we take a bath together?
Yeah?
Where you going?
I don't know.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
Hey Wendy.
Mikey was looking for you.
I don't know. How do I know?
You did your homework, Officer.
We already did.
Who's that?
Who's playing?
It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
But here's the thing.  I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there.  I mean, not in that fog.
What about your shoulder?
What happened at that signing?
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Huh?
I was her best friend.
But she was an attractive girl.
I suppose.
You gave her gifts.
Yes.
Then so was mine...
We had feared we were the only ones...
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
I understand. I saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. I saw you with the boy. You die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. But does that make you evil? Or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
I could give you reasons. Her silence. Her youth. It's forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
You would never give up life. If the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. You see too clearly. You see too much.
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
And yet you knew what I would o.
Your melancholy eyes...
What plans?
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
What danger?
So you felt it too!
How do we seem to you? Do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? Drink, you ask me! Have you any idea of the thing you will become?
What do you mean?
Your perfect. Your bitter and you're strong.
But why do you want me?
Fascination...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
That's all past, Lestat.
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
So you want me to tell you the story of my life...
It's just a room...
See? I knew you were interesting. You mean this literally, I take it?
Well, what a lucky break for me.
How did you do that?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
The story about stakes through the heart?
What about coffins?
Wait...Did you say off-season?
Your what?
I'm not going anywhere. I'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
There's nothing between Will and me.
No.
He's not coming. I thought he was just...
He does work hard.
Their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
Don't even think about it.
Think about this, Julie. What did you actually see?
Julie?
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend.
There was a body! I swear it!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Guess the capital of Brazil --
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
What's going on?
Can't talk right now.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
If the wind shifts, if the sirocco blows -- the hot wind from the South -- all danger will be over in twenty-four hours.
All the graves?
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache.  I'm so sorry.
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
What are you doing?
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind -or just because he is one's father?
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours  but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
He sleeps quietly. He died with a wine glass in his hand -- he died laughing -- a brave man, Drossos, like his father before him.
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
Do you mind if I go with you?
Well, at any rate, I would like to say goodbye to the girl.
Thea is so like her  in every feature 
I can't.
Who?
Get that ladder up here.
Yeah, very funny.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
No wonder you jumped in the river.
Made what?
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
Is this the place?
Mother . . .
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
I know  I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
It will?
Zuzu  Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
She's swell.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Sure  Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
Anything I can do back here?
Oh, I had another tussle with Potter today.
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about  build things . . . design new buildings  plan modern cities  all that stuff I was talking about.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
I know, but . . .
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
Yes, sir.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
What'd you wish, George?
Come on, tell me.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
George Bailey lassos stork.
Yeah, just started.
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
When do we get to the lighthouse?
Why not?
Your dad must be really pissed.
What is it?
I don't know.
You coming up on him?
Sean!   Catch the rope!
Tina!
Not the drugstore!
Mike?  Is that you?
Look at that:
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
The Shark's mouth.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?
But that's what we're here to find out, right?
Is there one in these waters?
Probably.
And sound.
Look -- can Great White Sharks communicate?  Send out signals, or something?  You know, take revenge, sense an enemy....
Do I have to talk to those two?
Let's get the kid home.
Sean's awake.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
Do you?
Sean's asleep.
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
Bullshit.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
That's it?
Where the hell is Air One?
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
When?
How old is your cousin?
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.
Get a dance yet?
Take a break for a minute, okay?
About damn time.
I'm not sure I can.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Yeah.
You see the three-quarter socket?
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
That macho pompous English --
And what else is bothering you?
Sure.  Want to try that new Italian place?
Oh, yeah.  Very.
Should protect you a little, from the compression.  If that thing gets ahold of you.
You amaze me.  I'm more scared than you.
After this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and I are going away.  Just the two of us.  No dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. Just you and me.
Yes, you can.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
How is he?
A shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  You know how many are born?  Maybe five. They eat each other before birth! They're born killers!
Like hell!
Why?
Still sleeping.
That's what life is, Doctor. Full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
Are you really?
Sure am.
You were great out there!
What're you doing later?
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Come on, sweetheart....
Did you hear what I said?  Come inside....
Yes, I did.
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
I miss him, Matt.  I still can't believe he's gone.
Close the door.
Beginning of what?
They won't kill it....
Stop that....
A big one....
You can stay in my room.
I want you to get out of the water....
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Mom, please don't start that again....
You're not a pain in the ass....
It's a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
Promise me....
You're not going to tell me, are you?
I'm sorry...I....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
You sure you know how to do this.
Still chasing fish?
Still tagging conch?
I wish there was something I could do....
Stop busting my hump....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
Shouldn't pick on that.  Sorry.  I'm sorry about your brother....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
I wish you wouldn't say that....
Trouble with you, Jake, is you have no sense of humor....
When I invited you...
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
How long has he been here...?
'Snuck up on me....'
Shit....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
It's my fault...I have to....
I knew there was a reason I could afford this.  To the woman of my dreams.. Who grows more beautiful....
Here it comes....
Oh, Jake... 
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
Yeah?
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Is it your vehicle?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
Why?
Identity of whom? You got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. She's untraceable, John .. You need fifty detectives on this.
I wanna take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
Stop it.
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Now?
Where's your watch?
Bull shit .. I'm in my prime ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
Have you got a print from the hand?
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
And did they?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
What does that mean, Sergeant?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
Vehicle references.
Then what are you hoping I'm gon- na do? Dissuade, or persuade you?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
Ross told me.
Really? What did he say?
Has he got your aunt's address?
It's not possible right now.
He don't know that. I didn't.
I don't want them to arrest you.
Yeah, I guess I do.
You think he still loves her?
You can drive down there, Sir ..
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
Okay, this is working.
This can't be happening to me.
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
This is fuckin Michael Jordan, man! They should be screaming.
Now what did you lose?
No no. I knew.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Too bad.
Beer okay?
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Another time, okay Dorothy?
Fine, I just --
What --
If I said that, would you stay?
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run.  I stick.
I don't need you to "stick."
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Rod --
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
I understand your anxiety.
Forget it.  Forget it.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
No, you're --
Look.  I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you.  Are we really "friends?"
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
We still having dinner in L.A.?
What --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
To the pools?
How sad --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
-- and I'll get 'em.
You said "fuck".
Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
Udesky.
This wouldn't happen if he was with you. I mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives years.
When did you have it last?
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I thought you were an expert.
You rented an automated litter box.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
They never got that big.
I don't remember that on InGen's list.
We need to keep moving.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Good luck with the fund raising.
Times change Alan. But you're the still the best. I mean that.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Why?
I want to be an astronaut.
See, I was the opposite. I never understood why anyone would want to go into space. It's so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and you're dead. The astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. And truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
Well sir, I am a great admirer of yours, and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.
You know, I've been traveling and I'm very tired. Maybe some other time.
What the hell is going on? What are they doing?
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.
Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. Someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Make a blind here?  Wait for the buck to return?
You are an academic.
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
I don't believe you.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
That was a pair bond!  A family group, even, long after that infant was nestbound!
The empty shells are crushed and trampled.  The young stay in the birth environment, that's conclusive!
I don't even know this woman.
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
You version of it.
What's he got in there?
What?
You know how to work a radio, don't you?
It has a broken leg!
We're sure as hell not going back out there"
You ever heard of Gambler's Ruin?
Why did you come here?
Four, counting the one in the chamber.
Funded by whom?
That's impossible, they can't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here!
You know, even if we do get those tapes back, people are going to say it's just another hoax.  Ian Malcolm's alien autopsy.
I was a cameraman for Nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. Do a lot of work for Greenpeace.
That must be interesting.  What drew you there?
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
That storm center hasn't dissipated or changed course. We're going to have to cut the tour short, I'm afraid. Pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  Drop what you are doing and leave now.
Woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
But would we get the phones back?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Elm that's it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - like birds.  What happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - a gizzard - -
The fences are electrified, right?
Ellie, com one!!
Yes?
He had to leave early to be with his daughter.  She's getting a divorce.
Yeah.
Let's get something straight, John.  This is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  Your investors, whom I represent, are deeply concerned.  Forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I'm not convinced.  And I can shut you down John.
This is overwhelming, John.  Are these characters  animatronics?
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Listen, ahh - -
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
It's okay to call them brontosaurs, Tim.  It's a great name.  It's a romantic name.  It means "thunder lizard".
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
I can't!  I'm scared!
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You got any kids?
You're married?
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
Where does he think he's going?
We gotta do something.
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
Mr. Hammond, I've decided not to endorse your Park.
Tim, Tim, Tim....
I am gonna have to find the others and get you to a doctor.  Will you look after Tim, Lex?
Your silence intrigues me.
Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  Dinosaurs had their shot.  Nature selected them for extinction.
Why didn't I build in Orlando?
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
Why did you do this?
What?
Hello?
Ken, it's Bruce. Listen, we've got a nibble on the Pendleton financing.
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
Chain saws.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Who is this? What's going on?
This is Janet Davenport -- I'm the Realtor.
I don't know...
What?
Doesnit sleep?
He wets the bed?
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
No need. I'm self-diagnosed. I have severe nympholepsy...  And I'm a bed-wetter.
Don't get me wrong. I don't care. But the professional part of me is interested in how you rationalize what you do.
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Yeah, what is it?
It's as though there were two people in that room... both of them asleep... both of them dreaming.
You're not going to be there?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
_Neurolar_. It's a stimulant -- it's also a serotonin inhibitor. It suppresses all electrical activity in the hippocampus... the part of the brain that controls dreaming.
Are you all right?
Have you worked here long?
Heralds of a new age -- does that sound immodest?
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
These strange stories you write -- they come naturally, do they?
That would be even worse -- it would be a compromise.
-- I'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend -- even without knowing all the details.  -- To see such determination is reward enough for me.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
You're just doing your job.
... My ... social situation?
I understand you fancy yourself an author.
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of obligation.  He was my friend -- if I can be of any help -- closing his affairs.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
Oh -- well, I thought he once mentioned --
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
How long were you and Eduard --
I've hardly published enough for anyone to draw conclusions from.
My only concern is the human tribunal.  Isn't it yours?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
Only two steps back?  Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
I don't know.
Was he depressed?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
He might have had a drink or two, despite what you think.
Probably not.
What did she say?
-- Just doing our job.
-- You seem amused.
Why would we keep files on <u>dead</u> employees?  All old files are sent up to the Castle.  Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees?
Orlac is an account?
You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
It doesn't matter.  It's too late for all of us.
What have you got there?
I want to thank you.
Give it back!
Ann ... Ann!
They're stoking the boilers. As soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
Pleased to meet you ... Hi, bow's it going? Pleased to meet you! Hi, Carl Denham ... How's it going?
Are you gonna start it up?
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I'd just be guessing.
Didn't want you.
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Well we're pretty --
I guess he figured it was better.
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
What? This?
-- OK?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
What're you gonna do next?
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
-- Then you don't need me.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Please.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Yeah.
What am I supposed to say?
You and I -- a relationship.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
I am.
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
OK.
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
It's damn lucky you didn't have the dossier on Cable here.
I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet.
Not particularly.
What does?
No.  If I'm not here, you go home with Thelma and Kim.
You get a new fence.
I'm sorry.
It's just...I've been catching a lot of flack at the office...
Good night.
Was there Burger King?
I don't understand, daddy.
I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones.
Yes.  I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen.  He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Mr. Kramer, why did you set up residence in New York?
Objection!
No.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
I consider it less my failure than his.
What?
How's the new job?
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me.  Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won.  Only...it was just another "should."  ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened.  I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy.  I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
Jim, I've got to go.  I'm already late--
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
No.  No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen.  He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be--I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man...
Tough...  ...I get off duty at five-thirty.  How long you been divorced?
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?
Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.
Oh, Christ!
It's going to cost.
What?!  She wants what?!
No, but--
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met.  No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
You were a beautiful baby. So calm.
I will buy them for you.
Holiness?
Yes.
I accept it. What is suffering?
Roughly five thousand men.
In the Pacific Ocean.
It is an island. American territory.
Where is that?
I am scared.
You will always!
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
You cannot.
Ahh.
But, I have no experience.
My department doesn't have any record of that, Mrs. Bickerman.
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes... can the police stop them?  <u>No</u>.  But feed one little cow to a crocodile...
Thank you.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
We'd only just met.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
You listen to me.  The only reason I'm letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
A spring trap!
Is this a trick?
Yup.
What's that?
I can arrest you!!
You probably <u>do</u> want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
This time, <u>I'm</u> gonna kick your ass.
You ready on shore?
Where?  Where?
Two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I'm still waiting on his sperm count.
What?  Oh as <u>if</u> I'm interested.
What?
You're gonna be okay.
Did you make anything of the tooth?
Oh my God.
In Maine?
Okay.  We're up at six.
No.  U.S. Wildlife is on their way.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?
Ssssh!
Alright, Jack!
It can't work.
What's that?
White perch.
Are they feeding?
Hank.  The little cannon you brought, get it.  Guard the shoreline.  Otherwise, we're done. We made the I.D., our job is finished.
He's done.  He's dying.
The lake was dead calm until up he came.  The tooth is in there.
This... how long did this attack go on for?
What?
The tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
Hey!!
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
That's not what you came to say.
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
I'm sure it's nothing, but you're a paleontologist, this is what we do, I--
This is what we do?
Kelly--
"Desperately random." What does he mean?
Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford.
How do you mean, Dr. Chilton?
I graduated magna from UVA, Doctor. It's not a charm school.
You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time.
Who's the subject?
He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her?
It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters.
State to federal jurisdiction... We can do it - eventually - but we'll never get all the clearances in time. Can you convince him a deal's already in place?
Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
Starling -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...?
Dr. Lecter, if you'd please consider -
I'm only asking you to look at this, Doctor. Either you will or you won't.
All flayed...?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
If you didn't kill him, then who did?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Not anymore.  Surely the odd confluence of events hasn't escaped you, Clarice. Crawford dangles you before me. Then I give you a bit of help. Do you think it's because I like to look at you, and imagine how good you would taste...?
I was your choice, Dr. Lecter. You chose to speak to me. Would you prefer someone else now? Or perhaps you don't think you can help us.
Was it a butterfly?
"Plum Island Animal Disease Research Center." Sounds charming.
He was a town marshal... one night he surprised two burglars, coming out the back of a drugstore... They shot him.
The significance of the moth is change. Caterpillar into cocoon into beauty... Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see. Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one...
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
After your father's death, you were orphaned. What happened next?  I don't imagine the answer's on those second-rate shoes, Clarice.
I went to live with my mother's cousin and her husband in Montana. They had a ranch.
On what basis would they reject him?
I think you were telling me the truth in Baltimore - or starting to. Tell me the rest now.
I've studied the case file, have you...? Everything you need to find him is right in these pages. Whatever his name is.
They were slaughtering the spring lambs?
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Yes, miss.
The Ottawa are gone.
Sorry to disappoint you...
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?
Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not.  If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If that happens, stay close to your father.  The French will protect the officer class among the English.
Maybe...
And my compliments to you...
Will you go back to England?
What?
And by sea!
Cousin Eugenie, my father, but...
I don't understand!
Any powder?
The red man put down the bow, picked up the fire stick and became the best warrior in the forest. Yes. It is the only way.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago.
Sir!
Sergeant Major!
Yes.
Granted.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
I am deeply touched by such unusual and unexpected generosity... The fort is yours under the condition that we be given until dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and women for their march and turn our wounded over to your surgeon.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
That it acquires intelligence from its victims?
What?
What are you doing?
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
Something wrong, Cobb?
Oh, God, she's out there...
What's your air reading?
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
You got money in this tub?
You read Russian?
Bullshit.
What's going on?
I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
No fuckin' lie...
What is it?
It saw us!
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares about us is different. Pass your phone.
I thought this was a pub.
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?
There are no others.
There were two old guns there; where are they?
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that because you need to know.
I think I can help you, as it happens.
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Son, have a look in his locker.
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
Yeah?
Jesus, I have heard about him.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
What's that idiot doing next door?  We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but it is never locked, is it Plank?

Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?
Invitations?
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
What the hell are you doing here?
I will.
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.
I know.  Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word then your left.
How much did you say it was, Tom?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a grocer's.
Tom, you're all heart.
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
What are you carrying, Willy?
Joanie Orozco's telling the whole school she's like desperately in love with Santo Guerra.
That makes it okay?
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
Yes, sir--
I-I can do the job, sir.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
Are we going to ever see your father?
Right.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Mikey look at this--
Seriously.
We should just do it.
--but I gotta say I think there's something to this cold climate business. I mean, you go to the beach- what do you do? Drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. Can't build no civilization that way. You got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Senora Cruz?
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
No! No puede hacer esto--[You can't do that--]
This girl is a friend of yours?
Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park?
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
I haven't been out here for a while.
He still living?
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
There was a mandate in the last election--
Your mother's family is Spanish?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If you spent a little more time training them--
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
What's she singing about?
Three months.
It was for personal consumption.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Murdered him?
Something wrong?
They've got my Amado.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
He's all yours.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Yeah--
Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before.
Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Yeah.
How 'bout you?
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
So when did Buddy leave?
No--
Payne.
He doesn't need to know all my business.
Who is he?
I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe.
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
Take a look at this.
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
About?
Death.
What about death?
Please.
I could scoop them out.
Don't.
If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not.
Yes...
And are you afraid?
Does that mean...?
Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name.
Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal?
You said you weren't with him for love.
I was so afraid.
Yes.
Quaid and Jennifer--
Oh God!
...yes?
Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel.
I'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  Will you be there?
Are you finished with me?
Then what do you want?
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
I saw him in Vegas once.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
Why'd you come here?
Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered.
I like to know why things happen.
Yeah, I know.
Was that Swann's idea?
No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after.
Shit...
Yeah.  You could say that.
I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible... coming home...
What?
People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know?
How the fuck do you do that?
It's me betrayed him.
I don't know what else to do.
Oh, I was going to discover the secret of the universe.  That's why I liked Nix.  He promised me all these explanations.
Yes.
You didn't try hard enough.
One question.
What?
He's not!  He's not!
Yes! Yes!
Don't touch me.  He's got... got into my head.
Swann?  What are you doing?
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
What do you do?
What did you study?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Of course.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Really?
No, you smiled.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
How old is she?
Nice one.
So, where'd you go today.
When are you leaving?
You're leaving right now?
Thanks.
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
I don't know.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Do you want to- 
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
How'd it go today?
Will you please stop smoking?
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Forgot my car keys.  What are you doing on the fourth floor?
Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks, Josef.
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
I found them in your file box.
What a...jerk!
Yes.
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
My secretary?
It's the patient's request, doctor.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
The patient was in great distress. Naturally he was...yelling.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
Please, Maya.  I'm trying to get us into the next century and you insist on this medieval nonsense.
He will.  He has great faith.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Father, please don't die.
How many weeks are you honey/
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
What's that got to do with you?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
You're sure?  There was nothing?
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
I looked at the coroner's report.  My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
We needed to know all we could.
You okay?
No oxygen to the brain.
What are these?
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
The police used him as a witness in this case.
Ah, Mom.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
Dad around?
What?
Hi.
Need any help?
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
That's not it.
She's alright.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
We've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit, so I'm starting you at point again.
Can I take your coat?
Careful.
Wait...
What?
I know...
No.
He's in college?
You ever been in love?
You lost your head.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
What's up?
I wouldn't know.
Just not my type, I guess.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
God, here we go.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
None of your business.
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Yeah.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
Give me the ball.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
What's up?
Who's nobody?
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Can we talk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
Cheap date.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
When did you decide all this?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
Like what?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
I'll play you.
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
What will this prove?
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
C'mon, girl, you live next door.  Who's been creeping?
Business folks.
We still have to go?
Guess he talked to you.
Sorry.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
You ok?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
Brain and Lung.
Alright, so I'm gonna transfer you over to Frank's assitant, Janet she's gonna see what she can do --
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing?  WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Yes.
Ok. For one thing, we're gonna need to turn that music down so we can talk, ok?
What?
No.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
It's not -- what's a 422?
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
I'm sorry.
No, no.  I was wondering...man oh man. I think I feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that I came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but I think I'd be a fool if I didn't do something I really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
You wanna go on a date with me?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
No, no, just casual maybe, maybe I thought -- there's a spot I like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
Great, bye.
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
ok.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
I'm sorry --
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
Yes.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
-- Richard.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY MAN.
It's ok --
DADDY, FUCK, DADDY, DON'T GET MAD AT ME. DON'T GET MAD AT ME --  JUST GIMME YOUR MONEY.
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
I think it's more complicated than that little man.
You don't just sign up to be a police officer -- it's about three years of training -- ok?
I'm trained, I'm ready to go, you wanna buy some candy to help underprivelaged youth in the --
I'm a rapper.
C'mon, man, just watch me, watch and listen --
Presence - with a double ass meaning gifts I bestow, with my riff, and my flow but you don't hear me though think fast, catch me, yo cause I throw what I know with a Resonance - fo'yo'trouble-ass fiend in weenin yo-self off the back of the shelf Jackass crackas, bodystackas dicktootin niggas, masturbatin' yo trigga butcha y'all just fake-ass niggas --
I'm almost done.
Now that shit will help you SOLVE the case.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
I'm walking towards the elevator's, Janet.
Well --
What?  What does that mean?
"The" cause of dullness in others --
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
"It's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
Don't get strong, Donnie. This is making sense, this making a lot of sense. You are not doing the job, the job I ask you to do, a job I give you. Over and over and over and I'm sorry. But I'm not gonna say I'm sorry that much more.
Well that's what Hospice will take care of for you.  They will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening?
...no...no goddamn use.  I have a son, y'know?
...ah...
Who are you gonna call?
What?  Say it again...walking in the car?
Hello?
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
No.
Is this 509-9027?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
the valley?
Well I guess it doesn't.
She's retired.
Are you close?
Do you have your masters?
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
I just...he was...but I gave him, I just had to give him a small dose of liquid morphine.  He hasn't been able to swallow the morphine pills so we now, I just had to go to the liquid morphine... For the pain, you understand?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
You're here.
I live alone.
Ok. Marice why don't you take a seat for me?
I don't know a loud crash.
And what about screaming?
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Then what?
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
We are not on display.  I am not a doll. I AM NOT A DOLL...I' M NOT SILLY AND CUTE. I'M SMART SO THAT SHOULDN'T MAKE ME SOMETHING, SOMETHING SO PEOPLE CAN WATCH HOW SILLY IT IS THAT HE'S SMART?  I KNOW.  I KNOW THINGS. I KNOW. I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM I HAVE TO GO TO THE BATHROOM AND I HAVE TO GO.
I love you.
Will that help?
Was there anyone that I know?
Yes.
No one else that I know?
Just once.
I don't know what I've done.
Want me to wake her up?
Do you have an agent, Stanley?
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
They look pretty smart, I think.
Adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- Linda. Linda. Calm down.
What are you doing?
Cats and Dogs out there, huh?
mmmhmm.
Mmm.Hmmm.
Um, no, y'know what? Forget the water, just give me a loaf of bread...white bread.
Yeah.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
I don't wanna go, I can't do it this time.
Stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there I'm gonna beat your ass --
What's the problem, what's the problem here?
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.
Stand up.
Yes.
I have money to give you.
...fuck you mean, it's raining frogs?
I can't bear to see you cry.  What is wrong?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Wh-- Wha--
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
He who is not with us is against us.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
But -- what is he doing?
Where are you going?!
But Aramis -- !  Phillippe can learn in time, but --
Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican, then who knows where after that.  If we miss him now we may not get another chance.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
So what has changed?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Pull them back!
There are more important things than tits.
It is also a place of burial.
And why are you so glum?
We go someplace dangerous.
D'Artagnan.  Perhaps you should accept his offer, for we are dead anyway.
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
This cannot be.  Everyone knows the Queen Mother is a recluse, and the ladies-in-waiting are but mistresses for the king!
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
He lies.  He is here to trap us.
There is... wrath... in me.  I have learned to hide it.  Those years in the cell, I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen, the way the mask happened.  Now I am free. And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost.  Look at this, all this that for ten years I could not see!  What if I become a king -- a king no different from my brother?
The desire for vengeance... can be a poison.
What is its antidote?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
A personal nature?
Miss Beaufort has accepted our invitation.  By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come -- as we wish her to be here.
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Even the bedchamber passages!  Let none remain!
I would not have disturbed you, Majesty, but you ordered me to keep you informed --
Riots?  My people live in the world's most beautiful city, their king has the grandest palaces on earth.  Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment?
Raoul... is in love...
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Shall I leave?
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
Cooperate?
Yeah?
Bullshit...
What the hell happened?
What the hell is this Marvosa!!
But what was a hair dresser from Malibu doing 60 miles away in some dive bar?
Nineteen eighty four.  What fucking difference does it make?
The guy was looking for trouble, shoving people around, being an asshole...
Did he harm the girl?
I was just having a little fun -
And what did he do to the girl?
Did you read today's paper?
You always carry a gun with you?
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
What did you do then?
No -
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
So...what happened to you, Jimmy?  I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
Both at the same bank...
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
What would your - boyfriend - think?
It was you who did the asking.
Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked.  So do I.  What do you want?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
Aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what Lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. The Tooth Fairy's ballpoint isn't...
Where?
Because it's his bad luck to be special.
What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.'  Confessions?
You look all right now.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
No other possibilities?
See? You do know something about him.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
What'd it say?
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
That's why the boltcutter.
Have him peel the top label back.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Where the hell's Graham!
What's being photographed?
The activities of nocturnal animals.
Ride with me.
Tonic will be fine.
It's me.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.
SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR...
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Mrs. Jacobi after her changing.  The Dragon rampant. Do you see?
I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
The consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of Dr. Hannibal Lecktor is you, Mr. Graham. Can you tell me anything about him?
I want to see Lecktor now.
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
She'll be in, in the morning...
Well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter G.
Okay.
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Tenth and Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C.
That's true.
Our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. They dusted everything.
Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it?
He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
None you'd notice. I'm lonely...
Kevin's fine. He had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. The dogs dug them up. Tell me what you're doing.
Yellow's a bad color for me.  I'll look green at breakfast.
Molly, dear Molly. Go to bed now, baby...
You should go to Montana. Stay with Kevin's grandparents. They haven't seen him for a while.  I'll come and get you afterwards...
Will, they never get to see Kevin and a few more days...
That's not true.
You going back down to Florida after?
Lt. Fisk said...
Yes. Who are you?
Yes.
Are you gonna kill him?
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
No it's not. Do you know how you did it Will?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
You had disadvantages.
What disadvantage?
Why does it feel good?
I hope you have a second chance...
Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
How long would they let me sleep?
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
George... I'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  But short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, I don't know what else to do.  'Cause I've always got to be one step ahead of them.
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
So how can I help you...?
So who's gonna pay for it?
Tony Clifton.
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
Really?
Andy!
B-but I have them.
B-but... we saw... your neck...
What are you talking about?!  We just met an hour ago.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
Why Memphis?
Then your father's a wimp.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Are you sure?
Positive.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
They are dead.  In either case --
Lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
He's gonna make it.
That's the third white van I've seen.
You ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
Don't be ridiculous.
I... it doesn't matter what I believe.
Did you hear that?
Whoa!  Shit, Neo, you scared the Bejeezus out of me.
Thanks... for the drink.
Just get me outta here.
Goddamnit!
Hello?
I've been looking for you, Neo.  I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
How?!
Do you still want to meet?
Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we both know there's more to it than that.  Do you believe in fate, Neo?
No.
The Matrix?
Why do my eyes hurt?
This isn't real?
You -- you're too fast.
She would say she knows enough.
She helped you?
What did she tell you?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Tank.
I'm going to make the call.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
That vase.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
Hello, Neo.
My name is Trinity.
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Get this thing out of me!
God...
What does that mean?
Goddamnit!  Goddamnit!
I have to.
Morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  There's no way you're going back in!
Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I'm something I'm not.
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Which way?  Which way?
Operator.
No, really, I liked it...thought it was great.
Look fella...this is private...
That means it's good.
No, all we got is $40.
Can't we come with you?
'And with your spirit.'
'My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that I might not be delivered to the Jews. But, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
Who's the girl?
Jewish...
How about Teresa?  I could talk...
Nah.
Yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  You make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. I signed for you don't forget.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
You threaten me with my uncle? After what I'm doing for you?
Back so soon.
No.
Hey...you're here.  They told me you're here...and you're here.  How are you?
OK, ok...
No...I'll be ok for a week.
Nope...
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Where's the rest?
I know.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Hemmingway.  Killed himself.  I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure.
It's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
Anything specific?
C'mon Charlie...one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
Don't count it...it's all there.
Will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  Tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
I know...I know.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Friends of yours Michael.
Can you spare it?
Sure.
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
He's cute.
Have you got a minute?
-- Black.
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
I haven't been the father to you that --
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
And that?
I'm afraid this is a wine bar, Mr. Quince.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'.  You like it?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Here...
No, I don't --
In my sleep.
Sounds good.
Do you think I need a haircut?
I'm all excited --
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
As close as a deal could be.
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
'Just kidding'?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
He was interested.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
Obeah evil.  I not evil.
Lunch is 'in' today, have you given it any thought --_
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
I've got plenty of friends.
I came to see you.
Very well, I'll watch.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Has her pain abated?
No, I'm not.
-- Could you?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
It gets worse.
Will it?
What will we do?
I - uh --
Shook me up.  I mean that you knew her and everything --
No.
There's one to every rule.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Okay.
I guess...
I wouldn't put it that way.
I couldn't sleep.
Yes, I saw you see me.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
You are?
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging.  It's missing everything that matters.
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
I'll take it from here --  I am --
And we're very grateful.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
Death!
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
'Yes' what?
I don't!
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I --
There's going to be plenty of time for that.
The 'question' --
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
...It's not over, 'til it's over.
Eddie?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
You like him, don't you?
You mean like you loved Mom?
Uh oh --
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
Bravo.
Raise away.
Where's he going?
I don't know, I can't say --
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
What was that?
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
Why?
So you're holding my calls?
Seen you together, that's all.
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, but I've misplaced my key.
Leonard, it's Burt from the front desk.
A cop?
I knew I couldn't trust that fuck -
Wait! Did he tell you what I was bringing?
Strip!
It's isolated.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
What does he want?
Help me.
Yes.
My wife.
Sweet.
What are you here for?
My name's Leonard.							 *
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
This is your car.
Why?
So was he scared?
What's wrong with this one?
Teddy. Your buddy.
Lenny, as a buddy, let me inform you. Your business here is very much finished. You're still here because of Natalie.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.
She has no idea who I am.
Happy now?
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
How do you know this?
You're not coming?
That's Sammy, not me! I told you about Sammy -
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
She wasn't diabetic. You think I don't			 * know my own wife? What the fuck is wrong		    * with you?							*
Your name's Teddy.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
I was the kids' godfather.
Oh, yeah...
...eliminated one.  SWAT's on the next two...
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
What's "nothing"?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Blanca...a rubio like you.  I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples.  Husbands and wives.  They all pose.  My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting.  ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room.  By herself.  In a party dress.  And she looked like she knew she would die alone...  She spoke many languages.  We were in Luanda when she died.  I went to her friends in Mali.  They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos.  He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs.  And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance.  Your mother?
Cost less.  That's the point.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
What...?
You afraid of violence?
What'd Neptune tell you?
So?
And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us...  ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us <u>before</u> Nicholas calls.
...where you're makin' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya?
Yeah.  CIA-level stuff...
Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network.
Hey, fuck him.
Okay.  What's up?
How will it stand up?
On the phone.
Okay.
Burnett?  They want 22% of the value on loads they run into South Florida.  It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads.  The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
Meaning...?
I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda.
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if...
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
No, ma'am, I'm not.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
I think you just put your finger on it, I do.
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Rico then, at least call me Rico in my own goddam place.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Where'd that come from?
But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
Yeah.
I'll find the money. If you just get me on the bus, that's all I ask.
If you have to shiver, why don't you pull the blanket up more?
Keep the goddam blanket on.
Hey -- whatsa matter?
I'm falling apart, that's funny?
A drink? I've got some nice gin. If you'd prefer something else, they'll send it up...
Lonesomeness is something you take. You bear? Dammit, you take it and go about your business, that's all.
Get down -- where?
Big peni-goddam-cillin bargain, right?
You got it.
You really want to do business?
Shit.
Dad...  I'll pay you back for all this, I Promise.
About ten kilometers.
Stupid.
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
He wasn't even in the car?
Yeah,  for the criminally insane.  I was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. It's awful. Namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
It's already been cut.
What?
Hishradyo.
What?
My passport!
That's a great philosophy.
Work, work, work, that's all do
His name?
Who got the Frenchman out?
H-how do I get...?
Go left.  Go left again till you hit the fork... Then right again. You got that?
Fine.  You want me to call your supervisor?
Any luck?
You said those cables're still live. Can't we rewire...?
You gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  Think you can handle it?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
But the power...
He didn't do it!
Just inner chambers...
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
I didn't protect him, lady. He trusted me. And I didn't protect him... His father...I lost his father to the streets and now, Chuy...
Do you think we did the right thing?
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
Why take the chance?  Just let me go down there with you...
It didn't bite me.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
We'll cover ourselves with this. They can mimic us-  we Goddam mimic them!
It worked before...
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
C'mon...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Watch your step, Siri.  Your grant could be on the line here.
I just...well, I had this cousin in Delhi.  She was having problems, too. She, ah...
My God.
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
How long...?
You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay.  My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm--
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
You're very kind...
I don't have a title yet.
Nothing.
The profanity bothers you?
It has no nobility.
I guess that means it's okay.
I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that.
I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that?
I know how that can be.
Done?
I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens.
I DIDN'T...
I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think?
Poor dear... Let's get you back in bed and I'll get them for you.
Paul, what you've written just isn't fair.
Misery's alive! Misery's alive. Oh, it's so romantic--this whole house is going to be filled with romance. I'm going to put on my Liberace records--  --you do like Liberace, don't you?
Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair?
No, I haven't.
Don't talk to me like that.
I know you do. I love you too, Annie.  And you're right. We are meant to be together. And I know we must die. But it must be so that Misery can live. We have the power to give Misery eternal life. We must finish the book.
Yes, Paul.
I'm almost done.
Did I do good?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him...
If I can.
Newspapers?
When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
Magic...
To win?
Then don't say it.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
What can we do' mate?
What if I pay the rent?
What are you doing here?
- right..where is it?
Not that it matter much but..I seem to recall you staying something like, 'I was hoping we could work together.'
So would I.  But it's not mine to give.
Much.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
Oh, I do.  But as we know I'm a very poor judge of character.
Easy, easy, easy, shhh!
'Terrorists?'
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Yes, I believe that's right.
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations requires the level of disinformation that yours do, is bound to get a little flak here and there.  You try flogging the stories on CNN I've had to come up with about what's been going on around here the last few days.  At any rate, it's been most instructive -- what they'll swallow, or what they'll broadcast with a straight face.  Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus.  Not even antibodies.
Yes, I gathered as much.
And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month, including photos of the victims.
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Yeah.  Why else would he come back to Australia?  If he had them both, he could sell them anywhere.
Now how to get in there.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure.
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
Come on!
Nothing but civilians, Gene.
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Talking's good, walking's better.
Who is "they?"
Did they send you...Did they send you?
May I come in?
You didn't have to.........
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Of course - Im sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Claire...Hey...
Claire.
Its all right, Ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
Youre in Prague?
Yeah.  I follow you.
I don't quite follow you.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
I'm not letting this list get out in the open.
That's the question I want to ask Job.
Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.  The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
The possibility alone is worth ten million.  Baggage car, rack 3.  Silver briefcase.  Combination 314.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Where exactly is it?
Claire.
He's got it.  Saved your ass again Jack.
What problem?
You're going to use Walter?
Jack's pinned down Sarah.  Should be a second.  Keep dancing.
What he didnt get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Twenty-six, twenty-seven.  So far so good.
Very good, Mr. Johnny.
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I'm getting married.
Again?
Yeah.
He did?
Yeah.
It's temporary.
Yes.
How'd he die?
When you get engaged?
No.
Stupid.
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
What are you doing!
Son of a bitch!
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
It's so bright.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Don't just become excited.
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
I'm telling you you can't.
It's really cold.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
He didn't come!
Let me go home.
You've gotta get outta here.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
You never have dessert.
What do you mean?
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
How about a month from today?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Why not?
What? He's in Sicily!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
I have heard that Johnny Cammareri got down on his knees in The Grand Ticino and proposed to her.
Where is she?
Maybe I should go?
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
What happened?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
Why do men chase women?
People home.
That's my house.
It's Cosmo's moon.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
Halt!  Who goes there?
Well, this is a temperate zone.
Not at all.  They could be carried.
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Am I right?
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Britons.
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
What word?
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
Stop that.
I'm invincible!
Good Sir knight, will you come with me to Camelot, and join our number at the Round Table?
Ni!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
I told you,  We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune,  we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week.
You're not fooling anyone you know.  Isn't there anything you could do?
Ask me the questions, Bridgekeeper.  I am not afraid.
That's easy!
To seek the Grail!
I promised I'd be at the Robinson's.  They've lost nine today.
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Yes ...  I'm very sorry ...
You killed eight wedding guests in all!
Gosh - Is he all right?
Herbert.
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
The Prince ... ?
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Sir Gawain.
Well ... yes ...
When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
Stop saying the word!
I didn't.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
She loved him.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
Checked and locked, sir.
Good man.  And is she all right?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition.  Du Royaum Uni.
It's the Queen's decision.
She's away to Windsor tomorrow.  Talk to her there.
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
By whose authority?
How will I know?
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
Is that the Queen's request?
That can wait till the weekend.
This is a slur on her good name.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Do you hunt?
Dare say you can be taught.
You're injured.
It's nothing.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
Why do you think I keep her here?
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
She'll never understand it.
In time, she will.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
What?
Those, over there, there.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Are they worth reading?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Then why send me back to them?!
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
I came as quickly as I could.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Is that not enough?
In the press, perhaps.  But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year.  Time to wheel her out.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move.  Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity.  You're smiling.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
What is he doing there?
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
What is it?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Does that thing work?
We vere thinking there might be tricks. You know, surprises that you'd worked into the game...
What's the question mark?
But how can it change every time?
He?
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
If this is a joke, I'm not laughing.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
What do you mean by "weird"?
Because I didn't know where else to go.
What?
You're not coming, Alex.
What the fuck is that?!
I'm okay.
You have no time.  What is your question?
Mom?  You're alive...
So what do you think?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
I'm going home.
Someone's shut off my money!
And?
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Okay, I'm thinking.
Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I understand.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
I told ya.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
I think so. I was just taking a shower.
Can you tell me what happened?
Yes?
Number 17.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
Mulholland Drive?
No.... I don't...
No. Just the coffee.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
"Really?"
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
Yeah, what for?
Oh boy.
So, you came to see if he's out there?
You feel it?
Yeah, they showed me
The one of 'em still alive?
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
Come on, it works.
So what do we do ?
We drown.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
Is this really the time ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
I do a very thorough background check. I go through police files, personel files, anything.
This is New York. No one notices anyone. Not even when someone disappears. At first it was the guy who was caught trying to steal McCay's Jag. Then it was dirty accountants that tried to walk away with millions. The Old Man got such a rush from it, I thought that he would start trying to send me people who used the copier after hours.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
I don't get it.
What about you ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
NO ! Don't open ANY of them ! They're all wrong. Just wait.
Is it over ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
This probably isn't the bet time, but I really have to pee. Can I pee ?
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
Never underestimate a man who cheats on his taxes. His file says he is an avid jogger.
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
So ?
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?
I have entrusted you with a great many things. In your tenure with this company you have seen and heard things that could upset the very economic world in which we live. I think this kind of loyalty should be rewarded.
But sir, most of the people we are putting into the "Park" are accountants that embezzle or investment bankers. They are not known for their physical or intellectual prowess.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
Sir ?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
No I am not.
So what's next ? No one's ever made it this far before.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Thank you.
This is too easy, I mean I had a speech prepared, then I even wore these pants because I could get on my knees to grovel.
As appealing as that sounds...
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Okay, now go under go under it ! Shoot Vader's Tie Fighter ! Get Him Get Him !
I think we should follow him...
Are you okay ?
I'm talking to you asshole !
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
I want to go to sleep for about a month.
Ow. Son of a .....  Did I ever tell you my theory on Star Wars as Porn ?
Why don't you shut up now.
Good morning.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Are you writing a poem?
Do you still teach?
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
This is California, anything is possible.
I don't think you're very polite.
What about giving the other guy a break.
Pommeroy.
Of course.
I already bought a ticket.
Hi Dad.
Totally.
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
How about a nice glass of milk?
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
What're you saying?
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
She's beautiful.
Hi.
He likes you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Hi.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
He's writing. Hello?
Vada what about you, who have you come up with?
Give it back Nicholas!
You're over reacting!
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
I'd never do that.
You ratted on my mother??
This isn't just a mood ring.
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Where are you going???
You mean,  this ring?
Hey look!
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
Write me a poem?
Muh??
What's it for?
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
No problem.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Oh...what's that?
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Oh, sure okay.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
Really?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Ex...ex, ex...
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
They're dead?
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
It's no big deal.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Did she ever see Vada?
Dance with me?
Yes.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
What?
Goodnight Vada.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
He was allergic to bees.
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
What was my mama like?
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
What do you get for that?
I paid the money.
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
He likes her.
Why?
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Well he just left, what's wrong?
I'm eleven and a half.
It's okay sweetheart.
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
It doesn't work, it always stays black. 
No.
Hey, where does it say that?
Who's that with your Dad?
It's my mother.
Can we go yet?
Got it!
Run faster they're after us!!
Hi Vada.
He likes her better than me.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
Not true.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
For what?
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.
What?
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
We'll never be the same.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Neosporin?
Two words.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
What else did he tell you...
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Jesus, we're trapped!
For the twins? What in the world is th...
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
... look good on Kimberly.
I had this crank call?  From some guy who thinks he saw her? I said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
Under the circumstances.  Charmed to know you, Jules.
And you think he's kept this to himself.
Hate that.
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
You never eat when you're despondent.
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
Big weddings are so strange.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
And I was thinking this could be our last time.  Alone.  Together. You know?
Well.  How come she didn't...
Because I could come...
Personally, I think Mr.  Michael's marrying the wrong girl.
You got a real good memory, Star.
What do you have to buy?
I hate that music.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
I don't want to listen to her sing -
Well, I have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
How did you come in here?
I'm sorry. I feel as if I know you. I'm John Triplette... a friend of Del Reese... I was at the airport. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a great fan of hers. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. I'm at the Sheraton South.
She's going to rest now.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
ABC.
You're kidding.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park...
You bet.
Ester and me did;  My niece picked then. She's just here from California.
What?
Well, don't be shy. I got the address here. Anytime you need it. Room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
Sure... you're a fine boy, Ken, you really are.
Did you see who that was?
Glad to see you. Ester'll be glad, too.
But not unless Nashville really inspires me.
What's this?
How do you know?
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
No.
No. Probably stay at a motel tonight.
We don't mess with accessories.
Parts.
Oh... Well.
I'm in a rooming house with Mr. Green.
I don't know his first name.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Fungus?
I don't think so.
Isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
Do you ever do any writing?
Do you like him?
Hello.
I'd really like to see you.
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Hello.
Oh.
Stay.
Oh.
What time?
Hello. John Triplette.
What for?
Do you study at all?
Why?
What?
No, we never did that
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
You want a ride into town?
Is that good?
Hi, I'm Sueleen Gay.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
That's what Tim said.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Congratulations on the Curtis Fox case, Scagnetti. You put an end to a nightmare. The ladies of this city can get to sleep again, and they have you to thank.
So can we. So the solution to our little problem is we had them deemed crazy. And we're shippin' 'em to Nystrom Asylum for the criminally insane.
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Sorry about that.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Mickey, you're wasting time!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
And they made the first move?
Yes.
Wayne---
Rockin'!
You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview.  You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
It's gonna be beautiful.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
What's the matter, Doris? Business bad?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I'll smile when it's funny.
Where's Wilma?
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
I been sendin' her money.
Okay.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Hard to get up in the morning, huh?
No. I'm new in town.
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
That's right.
How about it?
What happened, Duff?
What's wrong?
Everything you cook is good.
My kids want me to teach them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
We can always do that, Duff.
Hi.
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
Yeah!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Duff, I love you.
Where're you going to go?
I don't think that'll happen.
Where' you goin'?
'Round town.
How 'bout the key?
A whole lot, Frankie.
That's right.
Who're you?
What's on your mind?
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
What happened?
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
No thanks, Lee.
Well, what're you going to do?
Going back, huh?
How are you?
I guess I ain't.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Why don't you guys buy your own?
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Yeah. All a colored woman wants is your money.
I'll talk to the Mayor.
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
Beck's just put us on standby for crisis entry.
That's not the play.  Omar'll get a shot off.  I can still talk to him, Nate, I just need time.
We got any shots?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
You're hurt...
What are you doing in here?
Gettin' in is easy. It's getting out I'm thinkin' of.
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
Easy...
Those are all your records. I can have you cleared on all counts. Possession. ...Contributing to the delinquency of minors... Statutory rape.
If someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. I'm assembling a team of specialists, Mr. Case. We need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
There are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. They're dissolving, Case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. You have just long enough to do the job.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
And then?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
The old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
The words?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Ah, Herr Case. And how is the artiste tonight?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
We're doing fine. Take the next right.
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  If we re-enter over Mexico, we just might make it.
I need its matrix coordinates, Dixie. I've got to nail that thing where it lives.
Who got you into this?
A guy who calls himself Armitage.
Never heard of him.
Yo.
The run is tomorrow night, Dixie. Can you crack its ice pattern?
We run. You crack the pattern?
Yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. The way this is set up, I can't run shit unless I get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
Fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
Not good enough, man. They planted something inside me. I'm on my own countdown.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Hello, Case.
How long have I been out?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Don't fuck with me. I don't want to hurt you.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Once I kicked, I swore I wouldn't let that happen again. I apprenticed a razor girl in Osaka. Went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. Been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
What?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Petty good.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
College?
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Anita!
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
Now this is cute.
How about this?
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Hi!
How many times have I fired her?
You've done five of my ideas.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Uhh, no.
Hey there.
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
It's just for a couple of months.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Is that true?
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
You have to say that. You're my student.
Why do you do that?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
You were attracted to me?
Josie, you look Rufus.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
<i>                      Just a box with bright colored paper And the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
We're here!  You sent for us!
It's getting there.
Dad's fixin' something again.  Hit the deck!
Just out for a while.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
I wasn't sure, Ken...
Oh, please...
You know her?
I think it's sad...
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
So, you feeling anything?
I feel like a jerk.
Disappointed?
About what?
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
Hi, Kerry.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
I thought I'd wait for you.
If Simms catches you in here after lights out, she'll chew my ass ragged.
Horseshit.
So what do we do about this creep?
That was different.
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
What?
You need me, I'll be here all night.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
I don't know...
Nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
But nightmares are the common thread?
Call me Nancy.
The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
Who is he?
And you won't make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
We've got work to do.
Only one thing can save the children. The unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  It is an abomination to God and Man.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Okay, Group's in session.  Straight talk only in this room.
Mom and Dad?  That's...crazy.  They never said...
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
Well, they can be.
Sorry about that...
No.
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  Disaster...
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
That's fine.
Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
Let's go in.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
You've got to go.
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Eleven.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
With a goat playing a violin.
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
You and every person in this country.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
Who was Gilda?
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
Can I stay a bit longer?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Well... how have you been?
Thank you.  Shall I...
You were saying...
Anna Scott?
Bernie.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
Yes.  What do you think?
Have we got something for you. Something which will make you love me so much you'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Ah... yes, enormously.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
No, well... he was quite a long way away.
So it could have been neither of them?
I suppose so.
Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery.
I actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it's been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
I think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
What?
Well, okay.  There's this girl...
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
What book?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
Why?
Y-y-y-yes...
Will you come with me, please.
Oh, I had them removed.
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
H-H-Hearts.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Your horses are hungry, That's what she did say, Come sit down beside me, An' feed them some hay. My horses ain't hungry, They wontt eat your hay-ay-aeee...
C-C-C-C-Candy!
Say... God Bless America!
Ca-na-da...
Yeah, Harding, where do you breathe anyway?
I'll bet a dollar.
I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
Did to me?
Lobotomy?
He can't hear you!
What for?
I just started!
Just wait till you hear...
Hear what?
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
No, Mister McMurphy, it's just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at Pendleton.
Time out!
Time out!
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
You look pretty healthy to me.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
What's going on?
Oh, yeah?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Yeah, what's up?
What you boys doin' up at this ungodly time o' the night?
Prayin', brother. Prayin'.
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
Make yourself at home, Mister McMurphy...
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
At this hour?
What happened?
He is your husband, no?
She was your sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Let's find a telephone.
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
I'm a liberal!
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
A very large pig.
We'll KNOW.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Who's this?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
You were saying...
Why are you doing this?
So were you.
Yes.  I'm crazy.  You have driven me crazy.  No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
You're Damon Bradley?
Beautiful place...
Wait.
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Really?
So, what are we waiting for?
What's he do?
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Have you seen him with someone?
It's a miracle.
It's still the new year...
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
I just got a dial tone--
A phone message.  Only--
What's that supposed to mean?...
You think he misses me at all?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
That was really sweet...
A little bad luck?
What?
Yup.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
Uh, yeah.  Sure.  Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
He existed.  He was some kid I knew from Little League.  He was a real jerk.  You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
She what?!
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
It was you, Charley... .
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
Why Edie, I
They play pretty rough.
I'm with Terry.
In braids? That's right.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with!  They thought they could beat an education into meI foxed 'em.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Now what are you doing?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
What are you crying for?
Terry, what's wrong?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Jimmy...
He's going to have to grow up too.
You can!
Wilson yeah  yeah I fought Wilson.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... .  You think I should turn him in?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
No advice. Just whiskey.
You ought to go home and take care of that
I'll bring him up to your loft.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
I can't believe it a small fortune.   You can't buy me you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
What can we do?
Hold on just a little longer, Shirley.
But they are not yet one of us.
...And what is this?
El Dia De Los Muertos...A celebration in her country.
She pleases me.  Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes. 
When!?
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Your own pleasure comes only after mine, when I desire it. I am the Sole Ruler of the Dark World.  There is no one to challenge my authority here. My word is the law--all powerful. <b>No one</b> is to challenge that authority, <b>no one!</b>.  Is that understood?  It is my command.
There are others.
Aaahhnnnahnnnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
That's funny, Adele.  How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
I don't know where he is.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
I guess Adele's in good hands.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
Two hours.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
So what's that mean?  That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
Daniel.  Listen --
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
Leave it where it is.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
We're leaving.
Good luck, Richard.
A little.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
You comfy?
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Jack Foley.  You've probably heard of me.
How many was that?
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
We still talk, though.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
Oh, God...
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
So she did help you?
I don't think we should get into that.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
Whose blood you got all over you?
You know who they are?
Really?  Well, I uhhh...
Yeah, fish live in the present.  They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow.  Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved.  No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it.  They accept.
The fish saved my life.  Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure.  So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
You gonna write me a check?
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking.  I was never out there.
What am I supposed to do <u>now</u>?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Why's that?
It's a guy you know.
Gimme another hint.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth.  Along with White Boy there.
Oh...
You like to sit down?
No.
Glenn?  No, I don't know any Glenn.
Thanks, Dad.
Can we change the subject?
No?
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
Maybe.  But you're also curious about the man.  Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him.  You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
Not yet.  Where's Mr. Ripley?
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
What?
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Are those <i>my</i> suits?
Are you sure they're here?
We'll ask Evelyn.  Evelyn?  Evelyn!
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
Oh yeah.  I liked it so much I'm cutting you out of the squadron.
I don't buy that hot dog shit.  So you and your buddies are gonna transfer your planes up to Haleiwa.
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
Sir, I --
Yeah.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
They ready, Earl?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Good shooting, Danny!
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
Waitress!  Four beers!
How come you're not pukin'?
Where are we going?
Sorry.
Don't get smart with me, son.
We can explain, Colonel.
You take care, Dorie.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable.  What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that.  If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
Have the planes made it to China?
I have'na been able ta --
So you join us, Admiral.  Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans.
Hello, Lilla!
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
It's your grandma's strudel that's kept this family together.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
I don't get it.
That's disgusting!
Charlie...
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Refresh my memory.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Oh, Charlie.
I've got to go now.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Carol and I saw you with that creep, Richard, today.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
What're you doing here anyway?
What are you shooting for?
Don't you get along with your parents?
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Is that one of your poems?
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
This morning was good.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
Oh, you're both so naive.
Sort of.
What happened to you?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
What's inside?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Give me some credit, will you?
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Are you talking ~about exercise? Like gym?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Hi, Richard.
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
The Creed cat, that's right. Bastard's name was "Church".  Let me guess. Your dog's tissue isn't healing, pupils aren't dilating... maybe you can't find a heartbeat?
When I was young I thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
Thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I'll give you som antibiotic cream--
I hear you've got Marjorie Hargrove working for you now.
I was building a doggy door.
Out?
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?
Not that much appreciation. I thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
You want me to help?
I know, Mom.
Bob...
Do you really think so, Andy?
Thanks, you guys.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown?
We?
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
Get it?
Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you?
Correct.
What have you prayed for?
I know a good probate lawyer.
I'll look over the Q and A.
What impressed you about him?
Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick.
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
Are you a good lawyer?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
Do you have any lesions on <u>any</u> part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired?
What?
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Gay movies.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
Hello?
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
Uh.... No. Not really.
What kind of people?
You're the asshole, buddy.
Fine, Joe.
Have you changed your aftershave?
Yeah... ?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years, including benefits and projected raises, and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome... We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars.
Julius!
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Audrey? Oh, Audrey....
You did this? To yourself?
Tell me the settlement is right there! RIDDICK, PLEASE!
Amazing. I'm Johns.
What?
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!
We're just burnin' light here.
This does not help us, Johns.
Well? Is it just the pump?
Some prophet guy?
I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn't a natural die-off.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Do you have any weapons?
To the diggings I worked at a year ago. It's a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours.
Taylor, I'd rather you -
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
No, thank you'. I won't get into that battle.
This place is dirty, doctor.
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and scientific heresy.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
Huh?
Landon! Join the expedition.
If you insist. But I'm not taking any orders --
I think you're making a mistake.
'I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."
What about me?
A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that was belligerent.  Where were you nurtured?
Certainly not.	You're a mutant.
That's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim. You're talking heresy, doctor.
What is your proposal?
Sure.	In a cage.
Why? From the first, I've terrified you, Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I'm an intelligent being who means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?
What is this?
Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy. Unless we can prove our theories, we don't stand a chance of acquittal.
And that's your Minister of Science. Honor- bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.
It's humiliating.
But there's the doll, sir.
Sarge?
Yeah, what is it?
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yeah. How 'bout you?
...But what'd she do?
But what'd she actually do?
Oh shit! Sometimes there's things in my head... man. Grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy Indian...
Do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
What we got here a crusader?
I didn't like it.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
I have a darned good idea you're name isn't Betty Mayfield at all.
Yes?
Would you mind?
How soon can I get a plane to Seattle?
Merely for our records, Miss Mayfield. It's usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
What did you say his name was?
You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
I know it's a littler late for an apology.
What's funny about that? If you pick up people like Larry Mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. The world is full of Larry Mitchells.
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Want a spike in it?
Bad enough.
Dance? Tonight?
I didn't notice him.
Then he's got to be a detective.
He was following us--but he's not a policeman.
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?
So have I.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
See anything?
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
FLorida?
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Points very straight to her.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Looking for peanuts, I suppose.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.
I can't answer that.
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
Nice friendly approach you've got. Goble. I could hardly walk when I got out of bed this morning.
I don't like your perfume in my office. Make it somewhere else if you don't like Charlie's.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
What's this in favor of?
The usual grind.
"Money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." Very appealing, especially to a poor man.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
That must hurt.
And old man Clarendon?  He had a motive, too.  Margo and her money.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
Passkey?
Don't be a fool. I loved him. He wasn't worth it, but I loved him.
That's not enough.
With what motive?
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I understand.  Pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
Send that?
Would you?
Catch me at the Vancouver Royal if it's important.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Mr. Brandon couldn't be here.  He might have left something for you. What would it look like?
I need a receipt.  Sign your name across the flap.
I've met her.
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
I never saw it before.
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
Try Betty Mayfield.  The Mitchell case.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
Margo, darling. You washed me up. Remember? We're just friends. You wanted it that way.
She's very beautiful. She's much younger than I am. And she's rich, I hope.
What does it look like?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Thank you.
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers.  I haven't got the actual speeches now.  You'll have to chase them up.
What went wrong?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters.  Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious.  I really was upset. I stopped going home.  I never phoned.  I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier.  Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand.  So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart.  And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
Both dead.
Damn.  They're early.
Very thoughtful.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
Big mistake, I think.  You might have learned a lot.
Fuck off.
Hello.
It's that lady from Norfolk again.
Everyone's been marvellous really, Jimmy.  The neighbours come and sit with her while I'm at work.
No, thanks Dad.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
What have you got there?
It's because he desires you.  The women get all the breaks at these conferences.
And that's why you never went pro?
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
Friends of yours, huh?
What's their program?
One shot stopping.
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
I can't do this.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Wild ride, huh?
Yeah?  What?
A little mushy.
Added to which indignity, I got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of Quantico for a partner. Some quarterback punk, Johnny Unitas or something.
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Candle wax.  Car wax.  Mustache wax? Could be anything.  Guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  Gets sand in it.  Wipes it off with a shoe.  Shoe scuffs the counter.
Angelo, pay attention.  There's gonna be a test afterward.  Lab is showing traces of toxins.  PCBs. Heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  Okay?
Cole and Munoz are going in the back door.  Babbit is backing me.  So I want you at the side window by the hedge.  You're strictly backup, got it?
Got it.
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Catch of the day.
I can barely do this in broad daylight.
Mean anything to you?
Why us?
You're wastin' your time.
That's over the border, General.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
No.
You what?
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I don't question the legality of what you do.  It's your morality that makes me sick.  I will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
This time I imagine you would, yes.  Hmm...  With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
You looking' for some company?
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Must be dangerous.  Hooking.
I never joke about money.
No, but it's getting there.
My raincoat's in the back.  Put it on.
Diet coke.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
And why do you say that?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
I sell them.
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
It'd cost you.
Three.
Done.
Let's hope so.  You'll get some more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  Got it?
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
You liked the guy, though.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
Okay.
Good.
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
You still mad at'm?
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
Oh, god, what?
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
I'm up.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
He wouldn't say.  Edward... I think we got him.  His nuts are on the block and <u>we got him</u>.  You there?
I don't think there's any sense in --
All this because of that whore!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Either you're European or badly brought up.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
My Westley will always come for me.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Rest, Highness.
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
I fear I'll never see you again.
Gently.
It never happened.
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Why should that make such a difference?
-- where?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Where did you get that?
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that.  Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
-- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight.
Who won? How did it end?
Now, where is that secret knot? It's impossible to find.  Are you coming down into the Pit? Westley's got his strength back. I am starting him on The Machine tonight.
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
-- yes --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
What? What?
Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. You got money?
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
You're amazing!
There's something I ought to tell you.
No one of consequence.
I must know.
You're sure nobody's following us?
You know what a hurry we're in.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
You guessed wrong.
I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
Have fun storming the castle.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
What are you saying?
"I want to croon,
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
In looking at your books, I've discovered that ...
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Where?  What?
What was I saying?
Yes, it's quite possible.
Mr. Bialystock.  No.  Wait.  Please. You're holding me too tight.  I'm an honest man.  You don't understand.
You're going to jump on me.
Will you get a hold on yourself.
They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch.
Coney Island??
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
It won't run a week!
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
To failure!
Vat about it?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
Always.
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Finder's keepers.
Feeling better?
I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play.
Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye.
Smasheroo.  Smasheroo.
By the sacred memory...
Hindenburg...
I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse?
Oh, in show business.  Well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
Oh, sing.  Sing!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
What did you tell the people?
We have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  Did she stop here?
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
How early?
She didn't call anyone? Even locally?
No! Of all...
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
And when she left, she never came back.
Not at all!
Anyone at home?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
There's an old saying, "First customer of the day is always the most trouble!" But like I said, I'm in no mood for it so I'm just going to treat you so fair and square you won't have one human reason to give me...
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I'd really rather not. Please.  Can't we just settle this and...
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
He didn't mention the money.  What he said on the phone isn't important, is it?  He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
You should've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. You go starting private investigations, using people you don't even know...
What difference does that...
Did he say anything about my sister?
With you.
What's the matter?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
I hate tears. 
Is Mary... in trouble?
Well why didn't she come to me... call me...?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... All that cash...
I ought to call the police right now!
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
Where... can I stay?
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Of course we will.
Huh?
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
How could we prove...  Well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
It's regular. Okay?
Okay. What do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
You have something most girls never have.
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
Is your time so empty?
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
I was born in mine. I don't mind it anymore.
You should... mind it.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
No, not like me.
You're not going to... to your room already?
Why don't you stay a little while, just for talking.
Frankly, yes.
Wait a minute!
May I see your license?
Went out before service.
I don't know what you've been saying.
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
No mother.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Imagine--she was alive. What a horror. Could have been buried alive. She must have run away from the morgue.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
You--a friend to me?
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
Thousands?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Dr. Meirschultz, please.
What are you going to do?
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.
[Something very important. I have been threatened;] Mrs. Maxwell, my assistant's wife, is crazy.  She thinks I mur- dered her husband. [She wants to murder me.] I want you to help me quiet her-- give her a shot from this hypo. [Keep it hid till we get her] down in the basement-- there is a secret vault [there]. We will put her there till we get your husband--[then turn her over to the authorities. Then we will both be free.]
What is it?
What is it now?
Did you hear?
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Joseph returns from the room where Gisle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
What are you laughing at?
Did you? Where?
I don't think you could have a real affair. You couldn't care for anyone.
You would.
If you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, I am very happy to know you.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Meaning what?
He's getting a break, ain't he? He's front page.
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Listen, Jo-jo. Does this mean anything to you? Joan Gale's body swiped from the morgue -- Did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
Come down to earth. Do you think they would dare do anything like that? Don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? Shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
How's every little thing?
They don't suspect <I>him</I>?
Make it snappy, Colonel.
I told you he was a sore.
Ralph, come here a minute, will you?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
You weren't going with her?
Well, let's get back to the case in hand. They ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
That happens to be the truth.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
You are too gracious. These things have some merit, I suspect ... but this--  ... I am convinced, is fine. 
You will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  Is that not so, Marie Antoinette?
Your money may have been well invested, my friend. Something important may come of all this.
And you think I will permit this, my friend?
One of the maids-in-waiting for that Elizabethan group.
But I have some friends waiting.
I'd know him anywhere.
Yep. Everything settled.
We flopped the first time out.
What did it want?
Where is she?
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers...  But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
Don't mention it.
It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Rose, if you don't keep your boyfriends away from the house, Daddy is going to fire you.
Yeah, I'd believe it.
How did the rabbits kill him?
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Open that door, damn you!
Daddy, what's the matter?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
There goes Mother.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Is her husband sick or something?
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Please do.
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Who doesn't have such thoughts?  We'd better get going.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Oh, shut up, Rose. Shut your mouth and quit crying!
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Well, I have a pretty good idea.
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh?  In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
How is she?
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
You don't know where you're going?
Yes, sir.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.
Your baby?
You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel?
Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere...
You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters.
What's the matter with him?
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Mother... is Rose going to die?
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
We'll take the CalTrust heist, but if it's no good, we will hunt you down, and Billy-Boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
Three hundred kilos of White Lady hidden inside a giant bust of Abraham Lincoln.  A parade float.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Sons of bitches!
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I can work this.
Relax.
How you doing back there?
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
We're not stealing.  We're borrowing.
Nope.
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
I'm gonna put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  How 'bout that?
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
It's noon straight up.  Effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
He went to pick up lunch.
Well... seeing how you just suspended me, what's to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
Hold your horses, sweetpea.  We need Butch Cassidy alive, remember?
I'm gonna get beside him.
Oh yeah?
I worked my ass off for my badge, Kittle,  It's the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
Alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  Find out who "A.D." is.  I got a quick errand to run.
Get his attention.
What the hell's his problem?
Why the beach?
It's one of a kind.
I can't do it, Ben.
Yoda spoke of another.
But I have no sister.
I have felt him, my Master.
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
Vader's on that ship.
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
Lando, grab it!
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.
But, why must you confront him?
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
Yoda, I must know.
Do you have any tattoos Brad.
You promise you won't tell?
But it seems so unhealthy here.
No, don't do that.
"Transylvania"
Want to come again and stay
Dealing
I think you had better both come inside.
...Aren't you skating?
It doesn't bother me either.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
Do you have a phone?
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
They're all the same.
Would ya take off your glasses?
I always knew you was pretty.
Like?
Don't say that.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Christ.
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
He won't last one round.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Exactly what are you looking for, Apollo?
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Yo, pal, what's with you -- The place ain't operatin'.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
Ten minutes for ten dollars.
Here -- Three minutes.
...How 'bout for the Cokes?
The Champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- Balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- Creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- Creed snaps out a triple combination that backs Balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by Creed, a master of fist-men.
I say ya nothin'!
A hundred an' thirty.
You think I don't hear things?
Yeah.
No action.
Did you hear what I said?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
Make your teeth yella --
I like yella teeth.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Yeah --
Did ya win?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Don't let 'im get you tight.
How am I doin'?
Ya nose is broke.
Yo, Paulie.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Hey --
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Sure.
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
...Tight.
I got whiskey here.
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
What?
Sure I like her.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Apollo's a great fighter.
Do you feel you have a chance?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Gee, it's swell to see you, Eddie.  We miss you in Toontown.
What's this, Roger?
A new outfit bought the Red Car.  Some big company called Cloverleaf Industries.
Do you think the rabbit did it?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Yes, we talked to Mr. Maroon.  He told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  Is that true?
Yes, I find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  The rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
Downtown?  Fine.  Get a hold of Santino, I'd be more than glad to talk to him.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
What the hell's a freeway?
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
No?  I guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
Lemme guess where you got that from. Tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
He was blowin' his lines, all right. So what?
I've already seen your photographs.
Valiant!  You surprised me.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
No, I don't.
Aah!
What the hell are you doin'?
Look, pal, if you're still here when I finish this drink, I'm callin' the police.
Does this help?
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
So what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
I'll get it.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Quarrel sir! no, sir.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Of love?
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
As the custom is, in all her best array, bear her to church.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Goodnight.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Ay me!
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Nurse.
Do you really think so?
Of course.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Best beer in the world?  Budweiser for me, thanks.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!
Hazard pay...
I still am.
Oh please..you're on some sort of holy mission?
Don't even think that I'm buying that.
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
I'm sure.  But I'm sorry to say that it's too late for trust: we have a serious problem.
Do you have the material?
What do you mean?
Where's my information?
It is, I'm telling you it is!!
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Whoever hired us.
A means to an end, is that it?
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
American.
But first you have something to take care of?
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
So what is it you want to know?
Who the fuck died and appointed you food czar?
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Coordinate what?
Not at all.  Similar, but not the same.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
You don't.  You just learn to live with it.
If I was a cop, a real cop, I'd have busted you a long time ago.  This isn't about you, it's about the job I have to do.
We?  There is no we in my world now, Vincent, just me.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
The address of the Russian production company.  Just in case we need to find them.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
You were behind the door?
How could you have done that?
They don't have the package.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Closest and oldest.
And now...
Gone.  Destroyed.
I'm alright.  And you?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
I told Trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
We would never have to worry about money -- ever again, Jesus!
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
I...I can't do that.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
...Or get rid of the money.  I don't know.
How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
Here it is.
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
It's gonna be o.k.
You don't know if he was really gonna --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
You gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
Yeah?  So?
What for?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
What's wrong?
Yeah I'm fine.
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
You're worth every last penny.
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Lingerie...
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Do you know...34 C?  32 C?
I'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
Oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
All right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
About what?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
So be here at three.
What's this?
Hey where's the hot pad?
Whatever...
Save me the sermon.  I've heard it all before, it's boring.
Dwayne -
What do you mean?  You gambled it?
Give me the bad news.
That doesn't tell us much. Did you run a check on the gas like I told you?
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
No, sir.
Jail!?  James, you better back off. Badge or no badge, I'll kick your ass.
How'd you know?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon."
You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction.
I'm busy at the moment.
You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius.
You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two.
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
She said I could pick any girl I want.
You.
Why the hell should you believe him?  He had us beat up.  Naked.  That's nasty shit.
How the hell did Tan get away with it?
It sounds impossible --
I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor...
Let me guess, she couldn't handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I've seen it a million times.
No.  It's not right.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
I don't want to hear this.
She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick.
I won't talk to you, you don't talk to me.  We'll die in peace.
I believe in heaven.  You people believe in heaven?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
What is Mac out?
Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend?
I'm this way.  I guess this is goodbye.
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.
You move well.
Just trying to make it look real.
Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there.
Do you still have the bills?
The police can protect you.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
Fifty million!  Are we talkin' United States dollars?
Hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve Johnson's ass.  Well...you know what I mean.
Tell me about it.
He was trying to kill me, not you.
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Now, that's American music.
Are you OK?
Not anymore.
Well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, OK?
Jesus...what do you want?
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
Bottom line: I don't want some Chung King Cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What?!
Hey, hey, you start touching me there, I'm gonna start movin'! Word up, mother...
You a cop or something?
I don't trust anybody.  Especially first time deals.
You got a boy friend in here yet? Cause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
Yes.
She's fine.
Yes.
Hello.
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.
I don't believe you.  My father was explaining to Mr. Griffin.  That is how I found out.
You don't understand this guy.
Really?
And what did you say?
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
It's hurting.
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance...
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there.  You don't think they'll call it off...?
We'll see.
Really?
How romantic.
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical.
Too much.
Maybe someday.
You afraid to try?
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
I don't know.
Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
It's valuable.  Hang onto it.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's called changing your mind.
I'd rather not.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Is there somebody else?
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Happy New Year, darling.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Does it have wheat in it?
It's not true, but it feels true.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
Men never get this movie.
You were standing in the middle of the street?
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
I know.
He wasn't even wrong for you, like <u>cosmically</u> wrong, so don't beat up on yourself for wasting...however long it was.
Oh God, it's major.  He's kissing her on the lips.  I have to stop this.
What?
Yes, I did.
Are his folks nice?
Magic.
Hi.  So far so good.  So.  What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school.  Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health.  What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Why not?
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
You'll like it.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I don't know.  Do I?
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
Somewhere in the middle.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
What do you think?
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I miss her.  What do you think happens to someone after they die?
Okay, tiger.  Time for bed.
Don't ever do that again.
I was thirsty.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
This conversation is finished.
Do you like it?
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
It takes time --
Well?
Three hours! Just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled -- which I doubt -- I don't go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  It should've been a union demand from the beginning.
So? What does he want to do about 'em?
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Why are they singing, Mama?
They say I am no good to you.
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
How do you feel?
Sun up.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Lus! Come down here!
That's it?
No.
Bobby?
Now that's down-right insulting.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
I can't.
Fuck you.
So you're just attracted to me, is that it?
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
I need my paycheck.
You can still work.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Ass first into the world.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
They would have killed you too.
That's when he called me. He told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
How the hell did we get this detail?
What time is it?
What?
Wait  If you don't trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
Nah... I want to keep it.  Maybe I can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when I detox?
You're serious?
You want to do this some other time?
What the hell is this?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
When?
You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
That's real sweet, Garcetti.  Thanks.
Murder.  Beautiful.
This the guy?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
To who?
What?!
He's the only one I told.
You're lucky, Flynne.
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
And you've got wiener breath.
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Don't worry about it.
Sector four is secured, we put out the last three German one-fifty-fives, found them about two miles in from Ponte du Hoc.
A private, sir?
In West Fork?
The Army gave you that?
You know what the best possible thing that could happen is?
He's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble.  And he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
I'd love to hear it.
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I...
It looks like a Renoir.
Yes.  Do you know Sibelius' Fourth Symphony, The Normandy?
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
That only leaves three.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
Goddamn it, sir...
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!
Hell of a mission.
Uh, Captain...
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
A couple of weeks.  It started in Portsmouth when they brought us down for loading.
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
I know.
Don't let yourself get killed, if you do, they might make me give back the medal and then I won't be able to lip off to colonels anymore.
Thanks for drawing that machine gun off me.
Reiben, I don't know what I'd do without you.  Sarge, keep Ryan close to you and alive.
Just picture some French number been spending all day, every day, making cream-colored, shear-body negligees with gentle-lift silk cups and gathered empire waists, what the hell you think she wears at night?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
I should be on my way to Caen, sir. It's like Beethoven, the guy's one of the greatest composers ever lived and he goes deaf.  Go figure, I mean, who'd he piss off?  And here I am, the Beethoven of ladies foundation garments, one step away from Caen, the center of the known lingerie universe and instead, I'm going to Ramelle to save some fucking private who's probably already dead.
Sure, what do you want to know?
Reiben, what's the matter with you? I don't gripe to you.  I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.  Griping goes one way, up, only up, never down.  You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers.  Up, get it? I don't gripe to you, I don't gripe in front of you.  How long you been in the army?
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Why's that?
Cocks his Thompson.  Settles down behind some sandbags.
HERE THEY COME!
Hears the FAINT DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE TANK.  Barely has time to react. Sees:
Here they come.
Goddamn it!
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Fine, you convince yourself you got a pack full of feathers and goddamned Private James Ryan can carry my fucking gear.
Who cares?
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
How do you do it?
Pardon me?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Hi.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Lloyd?
I'll be in my office.
That's unlikely.
That's not even a scam.
Look at those eyes.
Lloyd, give it up.
Alright.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I can put that together.
I'll put this past my boss
Lloyd, why do you have to be like this?
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you.  When she was eight years old, she...
Well, let me start it.  I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
You should be.
Lloyd?
I like him a lot.
What happened to you?
I swear to god.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing!  Hello, Diane?
Yeah?
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Well...
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
What?
Me?  Sure I do.
Okay.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around.  Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
Yeah.  Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
This is so noble.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.
You need to study?
Okay.  It's good knowing this.
Okay, what did we just decide?
No, I don't, I don't.
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Alright, high level air safety tips.  If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Okay.
Man, all you gotta do is find a girl who looks just like her, nail her, and then dump her man, get her off your mind.
Man, you never had a chance with a girl like that.
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
What?
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride.  You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
She's very successful.
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir.  Are you alright sir?  Are you okay?
Oh boy.
Ooop, excuse me.
It's gotta stay purple.  All night.  Hey Lloyd, how ya doin'?
You know Diane Court?
Oh, I was just going to...
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
We're full on bonded.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
All right, okay, let's talk.
Every day that goes by, I'm losing money. Every worker that is shot, costs me money - I have to get somebody else, I have to train them -
It's true.  Never happen in Cracow, though, we all love you too much.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.
What's going on?
Oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. You've got to move them, the equipment, everything to Czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
I asked for metal, you gave me glass.
How you feeling, all right?
I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Any reason to think next month will be worse?
I'll talk to him.
I think it's too late.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
How's the name search going?
Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
What is it?
Someone who wants to talk to you.
Where is everybody?
Hello? Ted?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Its over, Cotton.
Cotton, I've done nothing but help you.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Where is Sidney's father?
Parents are always responsible. It all starts in the home.
Yeah.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Where's Sid?
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
And an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
I never meant to imply...
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
I think you're all an act.
And deep down I'm a good person? Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
Not good. How you doin?
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
What are we looking for?
Let's go.
What do you want from me?
You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your hand.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
What are you talking about?
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
I guess Gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
I did. Hon, although I got a total of six minutes screen time, they're the best six minutes of the movie.
Hello.
Who is this?
Thanks.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
You mean like, movie trilogies?
You seem to like movies, Detective.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Excuse me?
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware	of last night's Events?
Where are you Dewey?
Where's Gale?
Dewey my God I thought you were dead.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
It was fucking '60 Minutes II'!  I couldn't say no!  I could've been the next Diane Sawyer!
Dewey, you're not just here because of that second rate K-Mart, straight-to-video version of me, are you?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Dewey, what the hell is she rambling about now? What's wrong Jen, see yourself on one of those USA NETWORK winners you did and realize how badly you suck at acting?
Who's phone?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?
Get real, that would make me a suspect!
Just because you knew her?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Oh shit.  Hello? Director's office.
Whatever.  Come on, who is this?  I think you have the wrong number.
W-what do you want?
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE!
Well then the people you need to call are the police.
No I need to call you. Just you.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Owwww...
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
Dude. What are you doing here?
No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff.
My dad's in the other room.
Close call.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
Who did you call?
When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
I thought you were...
Hello?
What number is this?
To apologize.
You're making popcorn?
I'm getting ready to watch a video.
Really? What?
I don't know.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
Listen, asshole...
I'm two seconds from calling the police.
I'm getting scared.
That all depends on you.
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Please go away! Leave us alone!
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
...leave me alone... please...
What?
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
Evening, ma'am.
Deputy... good evening.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up.
You girls ready.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis.
Drive by patrol.
Watch her. Don't let on -- just keep your eyes out.
Where is she?
I want to talk to you.
Please. You owe me.
He was convicted in a court of law. Your testimony put him away. It doesn't matter what I think.
Has his story changed?
So where are you?
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
Are you okay?
You coming tonight?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
What's Leatherface doing here?
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You heard Billy -- shut the fuck up.
Why are they doing this?
Remember, there's safety in numbers.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
Good, 'cause I wanna swing by BLOCKBUSTER and get us a video. I was thinkin' Tom Cruise in ALL THE RIGHT MOVES. You know, if you pause it just right you can see his penis.
Just like old times, ain't it?
There's that sense of humor. I knew it still existed. Ohh, Sid, let's have some fun tonight.
That's mature.
What do you think?
Hey, so gluttony is one of the seven deadly sins.  But, this was a fat guy.  The killer may have felt this was the just best way to torture him. And, writing on the walls happens all the time.  It's like the fashionable thing to do.
I'm sure everyone's doing their best.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
What's so exciting?
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
Wanting people to pay attention, you can't just tap them on the shoulder.  You have to hit them in the head with a sledgehammer. Then, you have their strict attention.
We would have gotten you eventually.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
It could be nothing.
This is his stuff.  I've been out in the cold all day.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I read.  Remember reading?
There must be something.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
He doesn't have the desire somehow.  Our killer seems to have more purpose.  More purpose than Victor could ever conceive of.
The fingerprints.
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
How is this legal?
The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqu... Aquin...
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stupid son of a...
What are you talking about?
Well, there are at least five thousand notebooks in this room, and near as I can tell, each notebook contains two hundred and fifty pages.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
Well... what the fuck, man?
What is it?
Wait!
Are you absolutely certain?
It surprises me.  It really does.
It's a hard place.
They got to stop <U>sometime</U>...if they're human at all, they got to stop!
What you saw wasn't Lucy.
Another one, eh?
They're camped by the river -- 'bout twenty miles from here. Soon's it gets dark we'll circle out so's to jump 'em before day- break.
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Don't want no money, Ethan...jus' a place -- a roof over m' head...a little grub...a bunk to sleep in... an' a rockin' chair by the fire... my own rockin' chair by a fire...
Mose...try to remember!...You were in Scar's camp...
Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
What you want me to call you?
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
And you think we got a chance to find her?
Because she's my...my...
<U>YOU</U> don't understand, ya chunkhead! <U>You</U> didn't buy any blanket! Ya bought <U>her</U>!
Says her name's Wild Goose Flying in the Night Sky...but she'll answer to Look since it pleases ya...
Well, you're a widower now...
They'll be back...
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Not far from it...
Might at least have left me my pants!
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  You know how it is with women.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
What are you doing?
We just have to make a new beginning.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
But what is the truth?
Stop scaring people.  Let's go. We need to be on our way.
We should leave the past alone.
It's good.
You are a gentleman.
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
Then tomorrow you will have the pages.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
Are you writing?
What is the chief part?
Ten pounds.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
What's the title?
There's never any
Of course not!
Oh, that.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
So what do we do?
How?
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
Who is she this time?!
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
Now where? Will?
Cut round him for now.
What? Who?
The show must  you know
How goes it, Will?
Do you think?
I liked the dog, for laughs.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
Wait, you'll see the cat bites his head off.
Oh my lady, my love!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I am.
There is.
Moonlight!
Oh, do not go
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the dukeOrsino.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Where did you learn how to do that?
She loves me, Thomas!
I  Her letter came to me by the nurse.
What of her bosom?
No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
No.
Come on, David.
I won't be able to.
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Family? Family? Friends? Drugged-up wandering suicidal search of the self fuck-ups don't have families, David.
After you drink to love and happiness forever.
What? Yes, that's fine.
I want to secure it.
Looking for you? Yes.
They know.
About the mail --
I don't know anything about it.
Cover it?
Well, then?
Yes.
Cameron.
Yes.
-- instead of what he is --
-- which is --
Yeah.
You're right.
His car's still there.
He's got a car?
Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
Yes.
It's not every day I find a story in my own flat.
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
Be careful.
I don't see the point in that.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Boy, am I glad to see you.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
You'll wait in the hall?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
It's about me and David.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
What?
Can you afford this place?
No, nothing, sorry.
No, I've never seen them.
Are you all right?
Eh, I don't know.
In this firm.
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
That one, last week.
I'm a doctor.
I suppose so.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Lester.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
I know.
Nummers.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
I asked you first.
Yeah, it is.
No.
I am not!
How is she?
She is.
Yeah.
What!
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
I'd cut it...
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
Whew.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Did Lester know about him?
-- what guy?
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
Me?
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
What's that supposed to mean?
What with?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you shouldn't do me like that...
That's too bad.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Well, like what?
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Fine. How are you?
Honey, what happened?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
You're great.
George?
What!
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Egypt!
I already said hello.
Going where?
What do you want?
Your advice!
They didn't offer you the job yet.
I've got to get her out of here.
-- and take this with you.
How many?
What do you wanna know for?
-- yes.
No.
But what?
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
-- yeah?
This really ought to be layered...
Well... who are those guys?
I wanna hear about it.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Why, why do you think that is?
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Come on by.
A soap?
And?
You do?
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Shut the door, shut the door!
Why not?
That's right.
But you have problems?
-- Yeah, honey...
It's been so long I don't how long?
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- uhh-huhh...
Well he's not exactly a friend.
Is he an enemy?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
Sort of.
-- no.
Well... sure...
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go? Maybe we can change our location.
No.
Dad?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Yes, Dad.
I guess so.
Are you sure?
You don't?  Well what's your favorite food then?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
Give me your hand.  Oh, isn't it beautiful.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Why not?
Because he hides.
But eh what was the matter with him?
It's okay, really.
Well I'm going to have some coffee. Would you like some?
Yes, sir.
How?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
How's my credit in this joint anyway?
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
Sure is.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
Yes.
I...
Wendy!
Stop it!
Go away.
Yes?
Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Good.  Glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  Is your family having a look around?
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
Thanks.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
I don't want your money. You're a booger.
What do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
What's that?
Glasspack. He said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now I dunno. He's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
Okay, okay. Dwight Evans.
Uncle Al, what if it's not a guy?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I don't get you.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Yeah... sure.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
I saw what I saw.
Remember, Al... we'll be at the Ritz-Carlton in Boston tomorrow night! Or at the funeral parlor. It's Stickney and-
If you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. Give my love to Mama- tell her I'll see her Thursday.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Perhaps.
Okay, so maybe I'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  You want to listen, for once in your little lives? You want to pay some attention?
What about crack?  You a user?
SING!
So, hi there.  I'm... Sister Mary Clarence.  And you're... young Christians.  I guess I should assign you this passage.  What's good?  What were you talking about?
How come?  Sister?
His ashes?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
Yes, Betty?
What is it, Betty?
Not in years.
Well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  I'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
Is this... choir practice?
Chops?
Jackpot!  Two buckets
What?
Mary Clarence, are you with us?
Hopeless I
Amateurs 2
What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share?
A cigarette?
Oh. Mary Clarence, I'm so unworthy.  I want to take my final vows, I would do it tomorrow, but Reverend Mother won't let me!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Oh my Lord!
Mary Robert, I am so sorry about last night...
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
Enough joking.
What? 
Absolutely not.  I mean the wicked.  The heedless.  And their Las Vegas concubines.
Cool.  Is there a menu?  Or buffet?
Sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a Vow of Silence.
A fast.  To remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
Those girls were asking questions. They've got it rough.  I wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  I wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
It never solves anything.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
But -- why?
You saved my life.
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
At least he's not a cop.  At least he can afford a decent gift.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her!
I've got a show -- at St. Matthew's Cathedral.  We're singing for the Cardinals.
Hail, Mary.
It's a bluff, Vince.
Right.
Get her!
So that guy in the bar was right?  She's like... some kind of nun?
Mary Clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
The Little Sisters of the Moonlight!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
Excuse me, gentlemen, but... who has seen this Horseman?
Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse.
You must have missed your mark.
What are you spying on?
Keep still, Constable.  You were half-drowned when they found you.
For poaching.  Or, would you remake our laws now that Magistrate Philipse has given up the ghost?
Wallowing in sin and lust...
May we look at them now?
Maybe you should take this.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way.
We should go.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
Won't you change your mind, sir? What can I say to convince you?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
I insist that you have it.
I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist.  I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said.
I have not been able to face him yet.
Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them.
Ichabod...
Quickly, close it.
Where?
You cannot kill what is already dead.
Let her go!
You... you are alive.
May I see my mother?
No.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
I like them french-fried potaters.
All right then.
Now, Karl, you sure you want to go stay with these folks? You're welcome to keep on stayin here. It's workin' out real good.
Don't look much like he could. You say he can fix a small engine like nobody's bidness.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Who could eat with him settin' there makin' that goddamn racket with his throat.
Please Doyle, don't.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
Last time you got mad and run Morris and them off and said to stay away from here.
Hey, Vaughan, you know what I heard? I heard you been puttin' it to Albert Sellers that works over at the funeral home.
What's you last name?
What are all them books?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
They still around, your folks?
Why did he do that, reckon.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
It's name's A Christmas Carol.
Yeah, I reckon they did. Hit like to tore me up when I read about that pore little cripple boy.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Yeah.
It was alive?
A boy or girl?
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too. I just make like to myself she loves me. I know better, though. It just feels good to me when I imagine it.
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
You're just a boy. You ort not to use that sort of language.
Yeah, I guess so. I'm real tired, you know that. A kid my age shouldn't be tired of things.
I've got a feelin' today.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
Hey, Mama. Hey, Vaughan.
Did Karl go to bed?
Yeah.
I ain't got no boy.
Yes, I guess you are.
Listen, Karl, the truth is I don't know where they expect you to go or what they expect you to do. If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here if that's what you wanted. I'm just doin' my job.  You follow me?  Listen, I know an old boy that runs a fix-it shop deal down in Millsburg. He used to go to church with me. You're good workin' on small engines and things. If I put my neck out for you with him, will you work at it if he'll hire you?
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
Yes sir.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?
Yes sir.
Do they know about you?
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Hit ain't right for me to keep from tellin' you how come me to be put in the state hospital.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Do you have family here?
How long have you been standing here?
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
Karl, what are you doing here? Come in.
This evenin' I want you to go get Mizz Wheatley and that Frank and have them stay with you tonight.
He just got out of the state hospital.
I think there must have been a little mix up. I told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. It's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?
No thank you.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
Good. Then may I have the honor of extending an invitation to you?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
Huh?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
Do me a favor, will you?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Hey, Auggie. How's it going?
The Queen of England?
I didn't know you took pictures.
So you're not just some guy who pushes coins across a counter.
How'd you get started?
What do you mean?
But they're all the same.
You're right. I just wasn't sure you knew.
It could have been worse. If the cops hadn't come, I might not be standing here now.
That could be a good sign, though. It could mean that he got away.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Ready. Any time you are.
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
Eighteen and a half years.
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Talk away, lady of my dreams. I'm all ears.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Good old Frank. And how is fat Mr. Grease Monkey these days?
I told her she was going to meet her father.
I think you'd better stop the car and let me out.
Cut it out. Just cut it out, okay? It's starting to get on my nerves.
No you're not.
It's all yours, baby.
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
They catch you smoking tobacco, they'll stand you up against a wall and shoot you.
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
A little. Not much.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
Sure, Auggie. I follow. When you don't know nothing, it's like paradise. I know what that is. It's after you're dead and you go up to heaven and sit with the angels.
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Fifty-six.  That girl had on a corset.
Do you want something to drink? A beer? A glass of water?
Not a one. Not one customer all day. I bought this broken-down shit-hole of a place three weeks ago, and if business don't pick up soon, I'm going straight down the skids. What do I want to be hiring someone for? I can't even pay my own wages.
I'll tell you what. You want to work. I'll give you a job. Nothing permanent, mind you, but that upstairs room over there  -- the one above the office -- is a hell of a mess. It looks like they've been throwing junk in there for twenty years, and it's time it got cleaned up.
What's your offer?
Five dollars an hour?  I'll take it.
The name is Cyrus Cole.
Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Thomas.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Huh?
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Appreciation for what?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Why don't you go to the police?
It might not be far, but it's another galaxy. Black is black and white is white, and never the twain shall meet.
All right. Listen carefully.  About twenty-five years ago, a young man went skiing alone in the Alps. There was an avalanche, the snow swallowed him up, and his body was never recovered.
The end.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Here's what you're going to do. You're going to open up your backpack, take out your bag of money, count out five thousand dollars, and hand it over to Auggie.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
Seven acres.  I'm wonderin' what you'd pay for 'em.  Just curious, is all.
Bits of blood and wood.  What else would there be?
Him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. Lived in a picker's cabin at first.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
The best part was that there was a 'this'.  To debate the wrongness of.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Well, what then, sergeant?
And the next one...?
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion.  I didn't have a lawyer...
My apologies.  Do you regret not telling the truth?
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
If I whistle.  Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  <u>You're</u> the story today.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
You think that <u>is</u> the truth.
You found three batteries, you say.  A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
What else could it be?
So this...foam you found in the lungs.  How does it get there?
Obviously.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
I suppose you want a tip?
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Which of you dolls is Daphne?
Those idiot broads!  Here we are all packed to go to Miami, and what happens?  The saxophone runs off with a Bible salesman, and the bass fiddle gets herself pregnant.  I ought to fire you, Bienstock.
Funny?  In what way?
But we'll freeze - it's below zero - we'll catch pneumonia.
Right.  We have the same blood type...
Nellie told us about it.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
We are going out of town.  But we're going to shave.
Tore off one of my chests.
You'd better go fix it.
Forget it.  One false move, and they'll toss us off the train - there'll be the police, and the papers, and the mob in Chicago...
What are you doing?
Male and female - the moth and the flame - I ought to slug you!
But this is so humiliating.
What is it, young lady?  What are you staring at?
Just the three of you on that great big boat - you and him and Rudy Vallee.
Because we're pals - buddies - the two musketeers.
Congratulations.  Who's the lucky girl?
Osgood proposed to me.  We're planning a June wedding.
Why not?  He keeps marrying girls all the time!
Jerry, you'd better lie down. You're not doing well.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
Sugar?
Get me Room 414.
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
She sings, too.
Good night, Sugar.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
When I was a little girl, on cold nights like this, I used to crawl into bed with my sister.  We'd cuddle up under the covers, and pretend we were lost in a dark cave, and were trying to find out way out.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
You know, Daphne - I had no idea you were such a big girl.
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
Sugar, dear - let me give you some advice. If I were a girl - and I am - I'd watch my step.
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
We don't have to run.
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
No!
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
He's going to South America to marry some other girl - that's what they call high finance.
Wait a minute, Joe.  Lets talk this over.  Why couldn't we do it?  Last year, when we played in that gypsy tearoom, we wore gold earrings.  And you remember when you booked us with that Hawaiian band?  Grass skirts!
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Bull fiddle.
Well, I'll be - !  He does have a bicycle.
Osgood - I can't get married in your mother's dress.  She and I - we' not built the same way.
I don't care.
And I can never have children.
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
To Urbana.  It's a hundred miles.
Because I got some plans -
You need a bass and a sax, don't you?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
Look, if you boys want to pick up a little money tonight -  At the University of Illinois they are having - you should excuse the expression - a St. Valentine's dance.
No - funerals.
Oh.
We understand.
That's what I'm running away from. I worked with six different ones in the last two years.  Oh, brother!
Yeah.
Brains aren't everything.
What's in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
Would you mind terribly?
Because usually, when people find out who I am, they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer, and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars.
Your view of what?
Well, I'm not.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
- riding to hounds -
It's on the account of the shells. That's my hobby.
Guess!
Well, he's young and handsome and a bachelor - and he's a real gentleman - not one of these grabbers.
I guess he's not going to show up - it's give minutes to one - you suppose he forgot?
Well, that depends - on whether you're coming or going - I mean, normally the aft is on the other side of the stern - and that's the bridge - so you can get from one side of the boat to the other - how about a glass of champagne?
Oh, you have an upstairs and a downstairs.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
Well, of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.
Harmless - how?
You mean you can't fall in love?
What happened?
Well, it was my freshman year at Princeton - there was this girl - her name was Nellie - her father was vice-president of Hupmobile - she wore glasses, too.  That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon - we were standing on the highest ledge, watching the sunset - suddenly we had an impulse to kiss - I took off my glasses - I took a step toward her - she took a step toward me -
Don't talk like that.  I'm sure there must be some girl some place that could -
Anything this time?
You're not giving yourself a chance. Don't fight it.  Relax. 
Thank you.
Where did you learn to kiss like that?
Did you have a nice time?
That's wonderful.  Poor Josephine.
You're not?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
I only wish there were something I could do for you.
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
I know.  Every time!
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Booze.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
Big joke!
Clark Street?  Never heard of it.
You and who else?
Refresh my memory.
You don't owe me no nothing.
Say something. Please.
Wheres Nick sleeping?
Whats going on with you two?
You heading to the train station?
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Kat, we must talk. This guy, theres something not quite right.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Dont patronize me. Theyve clearly been at this a while.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you dont think he wants me back?
No, count it, anyway.
What is?
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
What?!
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
Yeah. You?
Youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? Its just business!
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. Its your job. Its who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
Whats he do anyway?
Like fifteen.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Thats not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
And you say all them people is dead now?
Here it is, right here.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Can you swim?
:The night in the woods with his father and SOUNDER. The shouting and laughter after the baseball game --
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
You learnin' anything at that school?
We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
Wheeew! This is some hard work, but it beats goin' to jail.
What's that, son?
Yes, David...
Naw, I'm carryin' it!
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Who's winning, Mama?
Who is they?
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
Mama! Mama! Miss Boatwright, say she gon' help me find where Daddy is!
No, ma'am...  Mama, I wanted Mrs. Boatwright to find out where Daddy is, so me and Sounder can go see him.
Good night, Mama...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
But, Miss Boatwright, you--
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
Little chilly.
Is there something I can do to help you?
There, you see?
Where you goin'!?
Will they give him a trial?
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
What is this?
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
Mph rm rmph!!
Norwegian Ass Raper.
Look at that!
What's the secret to making a woman happy?
Donkey raping shit eater.
Ber dada!
Uhh...
Mph mph.
Aw, ma!!
Uhh... I don't know.
What's a dying giraffe sound like?
We can't leave without you!
Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go to church, Kenny?
Oh dear God...
Shiteater-
You're all part of Satan's army now!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
AGH!
Saddam, would you let me do my job please!
Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The whole POINT of hell is that you don't WANT to be here!
Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke. Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only available up on Earth. He'll never get 'em, see?
What did you do today Satan?
Don't call me dumb!
Hey, I'm missing the party!
We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Stan! Stan are you okay?!
Wendy... How would you like to go get some ice cream?
You didn't?
What is it?
Dude, you didn't say anything about watches.
And ze rope?
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Oh Warren...oh Warren...take me, God take me...
Oh yeah...
It can't be.
Of course, of course...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
What did you say to me?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
You want to go back to shuttle work?
Look we gave you what you asked for.  It checks out didn't it?! What more do you want from us!
So, what are we waiting for?
Now I got enough air and supplies to make another complete orbit in the pod!  You're just gonna have to pick me up later.
Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
Why can't we?
If I could get to the bridge I could send the distress signal.
I'm not going with you.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Uh, it's ok, everything's going to be ok...now I'm counting on you, and whatever you do keep calm, we don't want them to panic.
I'm staying with the ship.  I'll be all right.  Now hurry.
Yes Mac, but the guests are requesting it.  It will reduce the level of negative feedback.
What is happening around here!!!
Officer Taylor, how are you this evening?
Ok Mac...  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.
Is it safe for human transport?
The pin machine?
Can I get you something for the road?
You have orange whips?
I don't know no Buzz Fazeli.
How do you turn this thing off?
Did you know you were parked in the handicap space?
This scam we got going here was your 
Buzz Fazeli.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
What do you think I can do?
Who are you? Who sent you here?
I got a right. You're my father.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
I had a career. She wanted a little bowler of her own. Sid and Breeze leap into the fray, prying the two men apart. They wrestle Theo against a wall, pressing his face into the tiles.
Fuck you and fuck bowling.
No...
Not for somebody who hit a man with his ball on national television.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Theo. Howzitgoin.
Who's there!
You shouldn't touch her.
Someone gonna get kacked, boss?
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
You might say I'm at the top of their shit list.
Maybe I can help you.  Try a lighter ball, Penelope - you'll get hurt with that big ball, honey.  I've seen tapes of you bowling on the circuit. You got Fazeli blood running through you. Your pop was a genuine talent in his day.
That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
You're using Theo for your own deviant purposes!
Leave him alone!
Don't go near the bowling alley.
He's not here.
Having a legend for a dad isn't all it's cracked up to be.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
What does he do?
Do you have a girlfriend?
Well, that was plan A.
What's plan C?
Yeah, but they're all little wannabes. I'm looking for a professional man.
Come on, bargain with me.
Then it's true, isn't it? About...
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
Can I come with you?
Fuck plan C!
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Very good, busyboy.
What if it attacks?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Where is it?
What was that?
Don't do it, Norman!
See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
Hold on --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
What's wrong with oxygen?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
Wait a second --
-- I didn't know it would come to this --
What for?
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
What?
So?  What's the problem?
What?
She's not gonna know.
What <u>about</u> a crowbar?
Look at this.
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
But what does it do?  This... sphere.
She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
That ULF report everybody's patting me on the back about?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
Where'd this come from?
What about you?  What happened to you?
Wait a minute.
Beth --
Beth.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Calm down, Beth.  Alright?
Where are you going in such a hurry?
You fixed my suit?
The refridgerator.
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
But why is he doing it?
It's for motion sickness.
It's like a sleeping pill?
I'm sorry.
What is it, Norman?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
That's bullshit.
Shut up, Beth --
You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
I know.  You're too strong, Beth.
Would it work?
Pussy.
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
We can refuse to talk.
Go ahead.  Ladies first.
Don't be so optomistic, Harry.
Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone.
Am I?
You don't remember that?
You didn't say that about the food?
How much time you figure to get to the surface?
Hold on.
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
She told me what you said, Norman.
Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.
You don't think it does?  I think it's rather obvious.
Think about it.
Please.  It must have flown here --
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
Well, he's polite.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
Let's just say the Force is something a Jedi Warrior deals with.  It is an energy field in oneself, a power that controls ones acts, yet obeys ones commands.  It is nothing, yet it makes marvels appear before your very eyes. All living things generate this Force field, even you.
It surrounds you and radiates from you.  A Jedi can feel it flowing from him...  ... from here!
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
Like Bogan weather, or bogan times. I thought that was just a saying.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
The Kiber Crystal.
Yes, sir.
Six hours, huh?  Well, that's your ship there.  You're blue five.  You stay glued to me.  I don't want any independent operations out there. Personally I think it's foolish for them to be sending fresh kids out on a job like this.  This is no joy ride we're going on.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
I found it... It's just not there.
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them...
Between his howling and your blasting everything in sight, the entire city is going to know we're here.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
Get to the ship!
They'll find its weakness.
But you promised!  I've saved enough money and now you have the extra help ... you promised!
Are you safe?
Mobile Infantery rules !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Don't think about it... go on instinct.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
Johnny, I'm sorry it had to be your unit on Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability...
Profile's wrong... there.
Well, whad'ya know...
I was thinking. Maybe we should get married, Carmen.
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
That girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
Who ?
Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
How do I know if this is love ?
He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy. Isn't that great ?
What are you talking about ? We both know you're gonna be a pilot.
Are you the boy for me ?
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
No thanks, Diz.
I don't stay where I'm not wanted.
Oh, my, what's that ?
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Mr. Rasczak.
Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal and he isn't inferior. He's the smartest kid at school !
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.
Is that your signature, Rico ?
Can you walk ?
Not a problem.
Inside 4th brigade compound ? That's crazy !
Well, my parents are against it, and I know it's my choice, but I was wondering... What would you do if you were me ?
Rico, you're acting Sergeant now. My last Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the radio shack. We need retrieval.
Warm it all up ! Everything you got ! Levy, collect the big guns from the towers. Watkins, put General Owen with the wounded. Rico, where's my communications ?
Why does V'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead?
Disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
It is a courier, Captain. Grade One priority. Non-belligerency confirmed.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
I trust you will... nursemaid me through these difficulties, Mister?
Recommend defensive posture, Captain: Screens and shields.
Forward motion, Captain...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Five minutes to Cloud boundary!
Mr. Spock?
Mr. Sulu, steady as she goes.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
I have accepted service here as a Starfleet officer... sir.
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer?
Engineering... Status, Mr. Scott?
Cal...
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
You get what you pay for.
That, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  Innit?  "You <u>can</u> go back..."
I <u>can</u>?
...the, the, the symbol of the fire...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What happened?
Cast stood me up.
...lost the screw...
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Oh <u>okay</u>.
But it's absurd.
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
Is it...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
We on for tomorrow night?
I wasn't doing business.
Oh.  What were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth.  I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  I'm sorry.  It isn't <u>you</u>, j...
Mornin', Doc...
But, does it have to be an Old Mill?
A jacket for five dollars...I can buy this town for fifty bucks.
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Because, because...we don't <u>have</u> to build an Old Mill -- they <u>have</u> an Old Mill -- <u>yeah</u>.  It's on a stream -- that's where you <u>put</u> a mill.
...they run on water.
They think it's your First Wife...
Okay, look, you, what is she, 19, twenty...oh Christ...
...upset and impressionable...  Get me the Mayor...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you like some?
What do you drink?
You look at:  girl comes in the room, an <u>apron</u>, a brown <u>bag</u>, what is she...? She's a...
Bob, Bob, stick to the business, will you?
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could be, <u>but</u>...
What's his name?
Get him on the phone.
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?
I like you, too.
You have to hide.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yeah.
I can't do it, Walt.
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
I...I...
What?
Wally...
I know...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
She won't stop crying...
She doesn't want to Bare Her Breasts.
Why?
I perjured myself.  I told a lie, and I ruined my life. That's what I did...  I don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  Turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  Give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, I don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  But what <u>is</u> truth? Eh?  In't that the thing?  What <u>is</u> true?
Oh, you're his attorney, too...?
He should be put in jail.
A witness to what...?
Town's out of lilacs.
Grace: get Mr. White a typewriter.
I can only write on a manual.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
How do they know that, you told them?
I don't know.
I was walking down the street...I remember, I was writing a...
That's what I said.
Eight hundred grand to show her tits...
Find the money.
Actually, the art department had some ideas on...
We got the permit.
Is that one hell of a kid?
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
Do something.
Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the <u>director</u>...
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
Well, you know, Walt, I just wanted to say that anything I could do...
That's very kind of...as a matter-of- fact, one, I hate to <u>bother</u> you with...
On your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
It takes all kinds.

No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...

Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking <u>heart</u> out!
And you<u>don't</u> tell her.  What you're going to say.
But Rache...
Put down that <u>goddamn</u> camera!
Cos she loves you.
No.
Aren't you going to drink your cocoa? It's the good kind.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
I have lava.
Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller.
So you're okay.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
But you can still see him.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
I have to get dressed.  My ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  God knows why, he was very mysteri...
I've got it.  It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
Which part of no don't you understand?
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Well, we're not discussing Rachel's age either.
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Me too.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
Still, please.
We...
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
What happens next?
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out.
...in.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
However many.  It's not enough.
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine.
You feeling all right?
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
How the hell would you know?
They came out of my <u>body</u>!
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole.
Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there?
Can I say one thing?  I mean, the <u>last</u> thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
That thing you said before.  Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
You put filth in my child's mouth.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Thanks for coming out.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
I never wanted to be a mom.  Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
I lost him.  I was panicked.
We have the kids this weekend, so...
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
They're my kids.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
It was God's will.
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
Oh. How did it happen?
Why was he on Death Row?
So whaddya think?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
OK, you're right, you're right  You know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Hi, Scooby! How was school today?
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You're tired of me. I can tell.
Reconceive.
Dad?Do you think that Brady will ever get better?
One in a million recover.
Thanks.
Hey, Mikey. You wanna get some ice cream?
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
...gger.
Again!
No, not really.
No.
I dunno...
Ah-hah. And how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
Anything I might know about?
Well, um, I kind of let things go on this novel I'd been really into - I mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. I mean, really, it's finished.
How many?
You a pervert?
Oh. You mean, like, Blair Witch Project?
Well, no. I'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
What for?
So like, yeahI caved in. I mean, I had to. My parents, they're like still really depressed about Brady. So I wrote the bullshit essay. Filled out the applications, did the interviewsY'know, I figure I can always drop out.
Hey, um, Toby? I was wonderingIs the documentary almost finished?
Uh, yeah, we're getting there.
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
Is he with the girl?
I'll lead.
I'm not arguing.  I'm just telling you what the deal is--Congresswoman.
--be prepared.
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
You're a lot like my father, Cooper... you think with your heart.
Well Filmore--
I hope you don't mind all this--it's just that the networks will eat it up, you know...
She's still alive.
What about Cooper--where is he?
He wouldn't take it on the helicopters. He'd transport it through pipelines that connect Chemco to the waterfront...
Dissent?
We can't--it's power driven!
Don't be ridiculous.
Yes?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
I did that for your own good, fella.  Now I'm not going to pull rank on you.  When this is over, I'll be happy to step outside with you and settle this thing.  Right now my orders are to locate General Ripper and put him on the phone with the President.
General Schmuck?
Yes, sir.
I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
A shooting war!
Are you trying to be insubordinate?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Now, as soon as you've done that, double- up on all base security teams.  Our enemies are plenty smart, and there might even be an attack on the base by saboteurs.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
I see you're playing your radio, Major. Isn't that contrary to my instructions for the personnel of this base?
Oh, it's not my radio, sir.  I picked it up in the communications center.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
I know that, sir.
But when they do, sir, won't they hit back with everything they've got?
If we haven't taken any further action, they certainly will.  Doyyourhappen to remember the statistics on our casualties in the event of a full-scale enemy attack?
Well, I think I remember reading the report on that.  Wasn't it something like a hundred and sixty million?
I still ask, why do they want disarmament?
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
General, now that you've done that, I beg you to recall the Wing.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
I don't think that's a fair analogy, sir.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
General, stick to the point, please.
You've lied to me twice - I'm sorry, but it will be strictly routine.  These men are experts.
I've got the heading, Major.  One-three-eight.
Forty-five.  Still coming straight and fast. Twelve o' clock.
Roger.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
Could you take her up right now, King?  Other- wise we'll get kind of close to the fireball.
Yeah?
Gee, we hate to leave you like this, Major Kong.  But there isn't anything we can really accomplish by sticking around.
Are you saying our order don't make sense?
Let's have a rundown on the damage, Lothar?
He's dead, all right.
What do you mean?
Why should they call us back?
Right.  So how could we get any messages?
I don't get you, King.
You're giving them an awful lot of credit for being on the ball.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
I don't anymore.
You know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
Mm-hm.
Hey, you said you did a video?
Yup.
A cloud?
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Mm. Hey, what are you doing now?
Don't let 'em fight.
Fuck it!
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
Oh, really? You wanna go look?
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
I don't think I like that guy's attitude at all. Hey, you know what? Take off the blades. I mean it. I'm gonna break your fucking legs. Take 'em off.
Hey, man.
It's safe, come on.
In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.
Oh, yeah, all the time. That's what I do now.
Yeah.
So you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? Well, here we are, What do you think? Pretty fucking pathetic huh? Kind of like one of those documentaries on educational TV?
It's nice here. It's different.
Hi.
Yes.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Mm.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
Hi.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
You hit her? Oh, wait, wait a minute. Why'd you hit her?
Go look, man. Go look. Go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
They let you out?
Wow. You did that for me?
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
I don't know.
They never hurt me? They hurt me every day with their attitude. You know, like they even have a right. Who the fuck do they think they are? Let me tell you something, I was born here. Alright? I'm an American. And I'm owed something. Look, they took it from me.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
No, no, no. I'm not being cynical, I'm being honest.
Yes, I stand for -
Did it ever occur to you that I might have some feelings about you moving to New York?
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
Jeff!
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
What?
I've run out of words.
Yeah, I crash there.
The prom. That's funny.
Now?
Well, not exactly.
For a while.
So who are you?
W-wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, man. Hey. No, you know what? Hey, it's you, man. It's, you know what, you know what it is? It's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. It's this cell. It's this void, you know.
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
Fuck 'em. Fucking assholes.
You know, why do you call me names? You know, I never hurt you. I'm only working here.
Get off my property!
Look Pakeesa...
Is that your driver?
It's stupid.
So? What's L.A. like?
Yeah?
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Jesus, Jeff.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Pal, she's a big girl, you know? I'm sure she's alright.
If you hit me...
Yeah?
Yeah, man, my manager and my lawyer.
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm jealous of MTV faggots who are named after animals.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
Holy shit.
And they get caught!
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
She thinks you went to the police.
Jack...
...so although their dad said, "Don't get out of the car until I get back with help," they knew the sheriff's voice as he yelled.  "Run to my voice - and don't look back."  The twins did as he said, but at the last second they turned around and saw the escaped mental patient, bouncing their father's head on the top of the car!  Ah!  They jumped, Diane!  They jumped!
No.  Wait!  Did I say Promise!  Cross-my heart and hope-to-die, stick-a-needle-in my-eye we'll never miss a payment?!
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Hey.  Eyes on your own belly!
And Hannah, you could give your share to your church - or maybe buy one of those hungry little kids Sally Struthers advertises.
We're dead!  They showed this prison movie to my youth group on Sunday.
Definitely old.
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
You sure you wanna go there?
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Kansas, I want you to meet someone special.
Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis !
The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors.  Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest.
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I'll take it.
Nothing for Ladd?
Why, you sweet kid.
Who wants true? Who wants moving?
Well....
I haven't been keeping myself at all.  Not lately.
You sure have.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Check.
Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Nice job.
Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars.
Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours.
That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway?
Twenty-two.
Hey, what's the matter... Betty, wake up!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Why not?
What happened?
Hello, Betty.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
They're dead.  They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  But that wasn't good enough.  Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too.  So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
It's getting kind of late --
You can stay here.
I don't know why you should be so upset.  Stop that playing, Max.  It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
Look, I'm supposed to fix up your script.  There's nothing in the deal about my staying here.
You'll like it here.
Just a scene I cut out.
I need some money right now.
What's wrong with It?
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
Shouldn't we wait for the others?
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
What's the matter with you?
Pull up at the drugstore, will you, Max.  I'll get you some.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -
Why are you so upset?  Is there anything missing?
Good.
Joseph C. Gillis?
We've come for the car.
Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind.
Now wait a minute.  If we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  Might make a cute musical: It Happened in the Bull Pen -- the story of a Woman.
Sure, Gillis.  If something should come along -
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Madame is wanted on the telephone.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
This is the staircase of the palace.
It's a warning, that's for sure.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
Who didn't?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
I don't love you any more.
Are you asking me for a "date"?
I bet they do.
Why should I believe you?
Nurse!
Guess! Go on.
Can I give you a lift?
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Why is he acting so strangely?
No plans for the weekend, Linda?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
What's it like?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
Shouldnt've done that.
What kind of a question is that? Of course: I am. I do whatever I want. All the time.
Zaltar, please help me.
I knew it!
Why?
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
No, no, on the football field. They called me...  ...The Smallville Flash.
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Sure.
Say!
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Kitchen. . . Technician
Not counting this week.  You secured employment last June as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
First paycheck?
How many sugars?
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
I believe they're laundered and sent to some charitable institution. I don't know what the heck they do with 'em. Maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
When?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
Now...when do I get a taste?
How you doing down there?
I never crash, Gus. That'd be embarrassing.
Thanks.  Let's go
Who is she?
Ricky?  Where...what...
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Now, Vera...uh, Simpson, you know my Staff Dietician?
Well, chum? What now? Kiss the 85 thou goodbye? Pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
But if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
She's not his mama either.
Small potatoes.
We already have a super-tanker.
A normal person.
Actually, yes.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
Really?
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
. . . Superman?. . . . .
It has everything.
A gang of terrorists seized the Eiffel Tower in Paris
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Shhhhhhh!
That little black box goes beyond any known conventional radar, it tracks Alpha Waves.
No, Jor-El, the baseball player that came from Porto Rico. Yes Jor-El your Jailer.
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
General --- ?
What about here?
Well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
Daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. But, I've been thinking maybe I'll take some time off.  I'm going to find a place like Smallville, in the country. Maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
I'm sorry to see you go.
The President is about to speak. I don't think it's going to be good news.
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
It must have been a super effort to get out of bed, Clark.
Close the curtains. The sun is hurting my eyes.
But Superman isn't an average man.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
But you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. You can't see any borders. It's just . . . one world.
Oh . . . no . . . I mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Is he for real?
Who?
Clark. He's late again.  I can't figure him out.
But he's never there.
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
The one Superman wrecked up?
Hey! Just remember I made you.
He's . . . cold. . .
Nifty, huh?  Goodnight Sweet Prince, parting is . . . inevitable  Now, destroy Superman.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
You're a great architect, Albert.
She's in California. That's wild enough, I guess.
Mother...
I'll bet you have some good ideas.
Are there any more at home like you?
Hey!
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
You're not the only one.
Me and my real estate? How  many other girls, Miss Teschmacher, are lucky enough to have a Park Avenue address like this?
What's the temperature now?
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Breathe that air, Miss Teschmacher.
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
Tea?
Good. Fine. Now where's my parachute?
You can't do this to me!
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
-- as we will be.
Enjoyed it?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Okay. Let's start with these strange powers of yours.
I wouldn't do that. It's against the law.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
195 pounds.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
Makes Cecil B. DeMille look like the Senior Class play, right?
Plenty! About 'The Crime of the Century,' Remember?
I don't need a geography lesson, Luthor.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
I'd heard that.  But she's well?
Yes...fine.
I'm glad to hear that Zoe's okay.
Which one?
I will.
I can help you.
I'll be back around nine.
Why?
So what brings you out tonight?
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
Billy, that's too early.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
I stopped by the station a while ago.  I stared at the bus.  I could almost hear the kids inside.  There was a lawyer there.  He told me he'd gotten you signed up.  Is that true?
From what?
What do you mean?
You heard what Abbott said?
You hate it.
Away from your crazy Mom.
What happened to summer?
Summer's over.  It's fall.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
Hey, Billy!  What brings you out on a night like this?  C'mon in.  Take a load off.
It would be strange if you didn't feel that way.
I won't lie.
Crafts?
Need a hand?
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
Why are you calling me, Zoe?
I'm a lawyer.
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
If you agree to have me represent you in this suit, I will require no payment until after the case is won, when I will require one third of the awarded amount.  If there is no award made, then my services will cost you nothing.  It's a standard agreement.
Probably half a dozen traffic convictions.  Drunk driving.  Lost his licence.  That's why he don't work no more.
How does the family survive?
And where did you sit that morning?
Before the actual accident?
Why were you scared?
No.
You remember this?
How do you like it, Nicole?
You and Mom have a lawyer?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
But Charlene...
Loretta...Sidney Falco...
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
How is dear old J.J. by the way?
Why, has he bothered you before?
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
Frankly, son, you lost me on that last hill.  Just give us the punch line...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
I don't take kindly to you and Falco selling me ethics.  Who's the injured party here, you?
Those "dears" sound like daggers. May I suggest that you stop DARING her to speak?
I wouldn't have called the boy exactly balanced...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
There is some allusion here that escapes me...
Hello, Harry.
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table...
You want something done, J.J., but I doubt if you yourself know what's involved.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
Can't hurt...
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
Well he's got her in a tizzy, I'll tell you that!
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
Sidney, I told you -
I know...I know you're the strongest cop in town.
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
Is Frank D'Angelo around?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
It is a favor, isn't it?
Feels like a Monday night, don't it...?
Not to me.  Sometimes, the world feels like a cage.  Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again...  I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Listen, get a good night's sleep - tomorrow's another day.  Feeling sorry for yourself won't help.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I didn't do anything!
I tried to reach you twice -
No more you don't!  What is this - You're showing off for her?  They're supposed to hear you in Korea?
You haven't told him yet...
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE  How do you think I realized I love you?
Imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  Meet the pilot.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
What chip?
We should abort.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
No good.
Negative.  The T-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy Sarah Connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
You have to do what I say?!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Does it hurt?
"No fate."  No fate but what we make.  My father told her this... I mean I made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- Never mind.  Okay, the whole thing goes "The future is not set.  There is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
I guess, yeah --  Oh shit!!
We don't have much time.
Easy money!
Mom?  You okay?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Are you afraid?
What does he mean, too correct?
Yesterday I read that Furtwngler was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36, Toscanini suggested it. Had he accepted, he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America.
I'm very sorry.
The British occupy the building where this guy, Hinkel, ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.
Major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
Major, he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect.
Hello, Major, my name is Dymshitz. I'm glad to see you.
I was in Vienna. I had with me an Austrian chauffeur, Max his name was, he spent time in the camps. We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage, scavenging for rotting food, butt ends, anything. I said, 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city, a million of 'em, and now look at 'em.'  And Max said, 'Oh, not these people, Major. These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics.' You get the point, Colonel? The point is they're all full of shit.
I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
Steve.
Major, Major... he's here ...
What is this, Emmi?
Sure.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
I have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. Bruno Walter, Otto Klemperer, Arnold Schoenberg, Max Reinhardt...
Yup, that's him, that's the guy. You know what else the little creep did? He kept files, close on 250,000 files. And you know what's in those files?
Who?
This is absolute nonsense!
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party.
You seem to understand the question, now how about answering it?
Guess what I am holding in my hand. You like guessing games?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Who's he?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
Any one of them's ideal for home defense. Which'll it be?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
Hey, I'm not stupid, y'know. They can't build anything like that yet.
And you're from the future too?
You cold?
We gotta get you to a doctor.
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
That's where we're going.
I don't think I like this.
...it had no choice. The defensive grid was smashed. We'd taken the mainframes... We'd won.  Taking out Connor then would make no difference.  Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  We captured the lab complex.  Found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. The Terminator had already gone through.  They sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. Sumner didn't make it.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
Are you finished?
Did you play recently?
It was an accident.
Pardon me... Miss... ?
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
You first.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
No!  I'm sick of this...
Who are "they?"
Overseas operator?  Please dial Allgemeine Bank, Zurich.
I'm back from the dead.
They won't...
Where'd you get that gun?
I have to get to the airport...
Big family... small?
Hey there, Nickie.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
So do you.  And to think I was worried...
How long's it been?  Since mom died... four years?  How are you?
Too bad, I liked her.  So, you're all alone in the House of Pain?
Fun?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Really?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Oh, God yes please.  Thanks, man. I'll take you up on that.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
There's nothing to forgive.
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
I'll explain someday.
We have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
What's all this for?
It's different every time.
And if nothing's lacking?
It's never happened.  We've never had an unsatisfied customer.
I need the police.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Look, where is he?!
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
"Under the Bleachers"... by Seymour Butts.
Nicholas...
Christ... I can't believe it... invisible ink?
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
Uh... Nell Vance...
Is that the question of compassion or science?
Not the way you've constructed your group, it's just not ethical!
No.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Like she smelled it too?
I don't know.
You'll never see it again.  Mr. Dudley's taking care of it.  I'm sorry, Nell.  Can I show you something you'd like to see?
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
Come on.
What?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
Why would we --
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
Don't worry, I probably won't be in here much.  Light sleeper.
Not really.
No.
Theo... Did you?
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
I'll take that as a compliment.  In the city, what kind of place do you live in?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
What's the matter?
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
You think I'm staying?
CQ what?
No reason.
Terry Valentine.
No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride.  And people don't change, do they.
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think.
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period?
And that's where you met Jenny.
What?
What post office?
Not her brand.
Sort a few things out.
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
She never told anyone else.  About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
He give me your address.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
I already knew.  Knew beforehand.  When was it supposed to have happened? -- two o'clock in the morning, Eddie said.
Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  She called me, asked if she could come over.  She and Terry had been -- having some trouble.  Lately.  I don't know about what.  On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
You think Terry gave me access to her things?  Probably sold her clothes.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
He alive to see this?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
And that is?
My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
Ian?
I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London.
That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there.
I got half.
We coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of --  -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. <u>Avery</u> wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere.
What's in it?
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
You've made it ... brighter.
Thanks.  You, too.
Hello, Ed.
...I'm so sorry about your loss.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Boy.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
I speak to you on ze phone, non? You have a special interest in music?
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Huh.
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. Here's to ya, uh...
Way out of line.
Right! Strictly business.
...You're not gonna screw me on this?
How ya doin', Ed?
Mm.
Uh-huh.
I only work here! And the lady's husband would know... Oh, Jesus.
Your place?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
...What a knucklehead.
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
I took Doris's keys.
Yeah.
...how I was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the D.A. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for Doris...
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.
Oh, hell. Drink?
...Probity.
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah.
I don't work here. My wife does.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
OK, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
Homicide.
Forget it!
That thing won't come after us, right?  It's going for bigger game. The group blundering around in the basement.  Poor fools.
Where the hell are you?
What's left of it.
We need light in here, stat.
Lieutenant --
The sub-basement?
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
What is it?
How much ammo do we have to make a stand?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
I hope you liked it.
Please.  Don't humiliate me further.
So the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
We will.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
Yes, I do.
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
This room sucks.
I don't want to go this way.
They were yellow!
Oh... my... God!
Oh no.  I smell it.
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI. Forgive me.  I guess I was snooping. What is this?
Somehow, when all this happened... I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
How did you know that?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
I don't know.
Where did you see it?
What was it?
You're not.  Where is it?
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
You'd slow us down and put Margo in danger.
That was D'Agosta.
Hide quickly!
You have to!  Listen!  All viruses pass on their own DNA.  Instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  This one was different.  It inserted a whole array of genes into John.  Reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  Those genes remade him!  It's not his fault!
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
<i>A month.</i>
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Who are you?
<i>A show.</i>  Then who am I?
Truman, I've watched you your whole life. I saw you take your first step, your first word, your first kiss.  I know you better than you know yourself.  You're not going to walk out that door--
Actually, I'm free Sunday.
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
Truman, you know, I did think about moving away one time.
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
What're we doing here, Truman?
What exactly?
Yeah...
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
I thought we were going to try for a baby.  Isn't that enough of an adventure?
What're you doing down here?
What's the hurry?
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Is there any way around?
Well, thank you for your help.
--It doesn't matter.  Everybody knows about it.  They know everything you do. The point is, you got scared.
I don't understand.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Good.  Good.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
Special Agent Scully --
I hope to. We're working to develop this evidence --
What is it you find incredible?
We brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we've ever seen.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
You said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
Do I know you?
S.A.C. Darius Michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
Before the bomb went off?
What was it?
Negotiating with whom?
What?
No. I haven't.
All I told them was the truth.
What? What are you talking about?
Get dressed, Scully.
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
What did you find?
Mulder --
How was it contracted?
That bomb in Dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
Mulder --
What do you think it is?
Very weird.
What are you doing?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
You're on the verge, Mulder -- please don't do this to me --
I have. I did. It's done.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
I can't go any farther.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Is she alive?
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
I'll be fine.
Edward Baines, I presume.  Hi, Ed.  I'm Pete.
Peter, okay?
I did, yeah.
This is Stargher we're talking about?
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
You sure about this?
They're hungry.
What now?
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
When we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
Nervous?
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
What about narcotics?
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
How's the patient.
Awaiting his arrival.
I need it.
Breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Don't understand what Harry saw in a fellow like that.
Well, if I do find out something, can I look you up again?
Oh, what was the name of that doctor? Harry's doctor?
Do I...
Tell me more.
It's just what he used to say.
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
We're both in it, Harry.
Holly.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
What happened to your hand?
Seventy pounds a tube. He wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
...and my lover. He was Harry.
Oh, the usual things...
...quarrel?
Nichts danke. Kein.
Joseph Harbin's body was found in the coffin.
Must you take those?
They are - private - letters.
Been here long?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
Ever seen one?
...a cop. You're a real cop I suppose.
Miss Schmidt.
That is the racket Harry Lime organized.
Bring him in.
I see.
A girl of spirit.
Do you mind if I drop off somewhere on the way? I've got an appointment, won't take five minutes...
No, a major, were you really?
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Yes.
She's been arrested.
I'm only safe in the Russian Zone... I'm safe as long as they can use me...
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
You really liked it?
...you know and all that.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Not yet.
Mr. Popescu is here tonight.
Mr. Popescu - Mr. Martins.
Are you mad?
Martins.
...Popescu...
Sehen sie da gleich da unter. Da unten ist est passiert. Passiert - English.
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
The Roumanian?
You don't mean that doctor?
Now, hold on.
...Mr. Martins?
With him.  Fifteen Stiffgasse.
Lime.  Harry Lime.
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Traveler.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. Eight hundred bath.
We're ok.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
I'm sorry.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
Incredible.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Fucking Danny, man...
Who the fuck are you?
I don't, but...
Disease? What disease?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
Your father??
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
What's it about?
Don't curse in front of it.
Why should I submit?
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
I thought there were people here....
What'd you say?
An investment banking house.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
What about...Manzetti, the synagogues....
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
Female...
Danny, what makes you think you know all this?
Are all Jews the same?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
I can't help what I think.
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
How did you get the fucking number?
It's German.
You mean Ilio Manzetti?
Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...?
Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?...
I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas....
You could do it.
When do you want it to go off?
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet.
Why me?
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
What are you trying to say?
Adam Sandler.
Funny?
Not like Mr. Dorfmann.
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
What?
Are you out of your mind?!
Do you think I...
Oh, fuck you...
You're going to live here permanently?
Are you going to keep it?
Maybe you should talk to him about it.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Did you tell him?
What kind?
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
The Italian, I presume?
He seems to have won it.
Forever.  We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
What was he like, when he was little?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
And just where are you from?
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful!  Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
Dollars.
Enzo, really.  What are you going to get?
Enzo, wake up!
It isn't lit yet.
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
And... does the voice come back?
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Great!
What room have you got?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
What?
You don't have that one, do you?
No!  I would never cheat you.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Please, have a seat.
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
Lucky I was there to save you.
No.  I want to show you.  Is it ruined?
I'd better get back now.
I'm going back home.
How are you?
So have I.  ... Hello?
Do you know how it is?  Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
You sure?
Assassin!
Well... here.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
But... how is he going to breathe?
Why is he doing this?
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
What's your first move?
So why the long face?
Well, for starters, we're going to honeymoon in Boca for a week. And then, when we get back, Morty's been talking about taking a stable, good paying job as a consultant for the JDL.
My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you.
Any sign of Santa?
That got annoying fairly quickly.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
Okay, what's the information?
So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF?
Okay, look. I'm going to work really, really hard on this one. But, please stop with the pressure. I'm already tense as it is.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Hammer, you alright?
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly?
You want me to be nice to him for no apparent reason whatsoever, buy him clothing he'll never wear, and for just one day of the year pretend to forgive him for all the horrible things he did to me as a young boy when my mommy wasn't looking?
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Good looking?
Oh, I'm only exploring your theory. Let's take a step further. You drink, don't you, Charlie?
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
I'm sick.
Who?
Don't look at it!
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Hey  I'm over here.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
Sure -- certainly - but what's that got to do with this?
More or less.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
You know a lot. You've taken a lot of fancy courses in colleges and that kind of stuff - - what kind of a man would kill like that?
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
You're too good to me.
No - not yet.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Yeah.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
Must it?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public, doesnt it?
When will they be back?
You wouldnt recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brothers death.
Perhaps it wasnt so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Can it be that easy?
I found this at your brothers.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
I cant tell you that yet. But hes being well looked after.
How dare you...  You dont know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
Have you got a pen?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you cant satisfy him?
Youre mad...
Why... I dont know what youre talking about.
And you still havent told me why you sent me after Friedman.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
Should I?
You know something? Ive just seen so much ugliness I dont think Id mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  Id hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if thats the way you want it.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brothers not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
So you did talk about it, huh?
Youre sure you wont sit down, Miss Stewart?
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
You dont know why hes come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
Im sure Ill find a way.
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Look, you dont tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldnt imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Whos the guy? The Austrian?
That-that wont do. Thats not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, thats the way...
Damn it! You cant fucking walk away from this!
Theyd never let me go. And youd end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Fifteen for a straight delivery. Twenty with the provision of a safe place. Visitors tend to find the second option more convenient.
Whos the money man?
I dont know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Oh... We split up.
Well, I hope youre not too heartbroken and...
Didnt you say I came recommended?  Thats what I thought. May I know by whom?
I didnt mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
What happens now?
Vous tes Franais?
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Where is Friedman?
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who cant do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
The Hyatt...? Whats that?
What is it?
What are you talking about?
Your lady friend did.
An Austrian.
Ill be alone.
Can I get up now?
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you hes terrified of men, so...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
Uh-huh.
No shit... Well, Im afraid I cant help you.
Huh! You could always try Suicide Bridge.  You dont know Leon, do you?
Le montage, lemballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Gluck.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Are they still operative?
What do you mean?
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon.  Jean... I place her in your care.  Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
What do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
I would like some fresh straw.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
I thought you were an archer?
Who do they think I am?!
Well...
I'll go.
You make it sound so simple...
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
We must sound the retreat!
But... why... what's the point?
But that was her order!
I tried to.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Why?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is.  This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
Your king?  Ah yes, of course... What's he going to pay me with? Cows?  Chickens?  I prefer gold, and the English have plenty.  I wonder how much they'll pay... to have the Witch of Orleans in their clutches? Those English are so arrogant, they can't accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
But where are you going to be?
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
Your trial, Jeanne.  On a charge of heresy.
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Were you baptized?
Yes...
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
Thanks be to God.
Buying her?
20,000?!  But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
You think?
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
Get them out of here!
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
His face.
So... what is the message?
Jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
Well...?  Shall we go?
Clear?
Besides, what about these...?
I don't know... I thought...
What are you doing out here?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
Do you think this cross will protect you?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Who is this "he"?
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
You can't, it's too dangerous.
Dorota!
Wladyslaw Szpilman.
Dorota.
And how's Yurek?
What did I tell you?
Funny time to say this.
Henryk's in there.
Then there's nothing I can do. He should've joined us when I gave him the chance..
Who told you?
Yes, I'm looking at you and that's why I'm here. Your whole family can have a better life. You want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
We leave the money and the watch on the table. And we cover it like this.  In full view. The Germans will search high and low, I promise you, they'll never notice it.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
What's that mean, no employment certificate?
I have to say you look terrible. What's the trouble?
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
I was listening, Kitten.
It's easy to get out, it's how you survive on the other side that's hard.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
I was... I was trying to open this tin.
What's your work?
Are the Russians here?
What about you?
Which mountains are those dear?
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
She looks tired.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
You don't want to learn.
You mean in signs?
Wash them again.
She wants to see what you can do.
She says, throw the piano overboard.
We can't leave the piano
What are ya gonna do, call the cops?
Best we had was Cat's Eye in the second at Del Mar, and he was only 5-2.  Not many longshots comin' in today.
Thanks.  I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'. 
Twist, you know this guy?
You're late.  Where you been?
...It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.
They didn't think he'd be so cagey, that's all.  They'll get him next time.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
We were partners.  If it weren't for Luther I'd still be hustlin' pinball down at Gianelli's.  I don't need anything more than I got.
Who's got the contract?
You want the stuff tomorrow or don't ya?  It's gonna take hours just to clean it up.  Besides, Gondorff's still a hot item.  Where am I gonna be if he gets hit?
We'll get by without 'em.
Right down to my socks, turkey.  If I'da been half as scared a that lop-ear, I wouldn't a fallen asleep on 'em.  Lonnegan might kill me, but at least he won't bore me to death.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
I gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
Just a little nervous, that's all.
You beat him, kid.
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
Not enough to cover a bet that big.
Looks like he's sulking.
What's the problem?
You in?
I guess I left it in my room.
She coulda killed me last night.
You're crazy.  I'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.
My end was only one.
What for?  I haven't done anything.
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
What the hell for?
I, ah...thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.
Les, I got Mr. Lonnegan with me. He wants to see you a second.
I feel lucky tonight.
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
Get on with it then.
You stayin' in or not?
Look, I got nothin' against you, but you're in trouble here.  All you gotta do is tell us when Gondorff's gonna play his chump. We come in at the sting, make the pinch, and you walk out free as a bird.  No questions, no court appearance, nothing.
I mean completely played.  Until he's beat and the score is taken. You come in before we beat him and I'll kill him.  You'll have a tough time explaining that, won't ya.
Take it easy.  Everything's all right.  I put it on Syphon, on the nose.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He'll never do it.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Why not?
I can't.
Do you think I care
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
You're talking like a crazy person,
You took that money from Julia's hand.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
He wouldn't say.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
tried him once -
You heard about Julia Wolf?
She... she fell over backwards.
I bought it in a pawn shop.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Well, what'd you think?
Trail him!  Trail who?
Rosebreen.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
You mean that body-----?
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Where were you?
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I know.
Why don't you go to see Julia? She handles his money.
Why, you said...
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
What bonds?
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
Oh, he's sitting up.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Is Julia going with you?
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Where's Gilbert?
That's all swell.  Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
Once I wanted five grand --  Cash -
Hello, baby.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
If you like 'em like that.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Six Martinis.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
What are you drinking?
She didn't tell me a thing.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
So am I.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
He's just been for a walk.
What are you going to do?
You bet I wouldn't.
He was down in the shop.
That's a fact.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them.  They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims.  Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Yes!
Who do you think did it?
Mimi!
You're going to drive me crazy!
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Is that true?
It's the only way it makes sense.
No, Mr. Charles.
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
You his wife?
I know I left them there.
Home?
Where were you going?
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
What?
They stopped.
All right.  Let's get out of here.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
And they can't fly around out there forever.
Epps!
Maybe we should split it up now.
We can't just leave him.  He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Knock it off!
There might be something in there.
You think?
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
Third.  What you're going to do with your third.
Take the binoculars.
Steady it out!
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
I heard it click.
We're going to be right over here.
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
You're going to be fine.
Wes is right.  If there were any more mines we would have found them.  Hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with Iran.
This.  Whatever it is.
They're doing more than slapping.
We're not going to do anything.
Think there might be more Iraqis?
What are you doing?
I wouldn't know.  I never imagined this. Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this.
Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line.  It didn't seem that long.
We can't just leave him.
Sure.
Yeah.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
Just let me rest for a second.
What did you say?
And then what?
To where?
Can you ride a horse?
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Somebody has to.
Yeah.  Even after that.  You didn't take it out on me, except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now.  But I'd say you've been very fair.  I just think it's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple.
Still am.  There's more gold than I thought, and since there's only two of us now...  Where should I go?
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
What does that mean?
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
Now you need me.
Yeah, you're funny.
You get it yet?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
You ever think about dying?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
It's...it's...I don't know what it is.
That's it.  It's over.  Eighteen hours into the war and it's over.
It's about a hundred miles from where we are now.  How long do you think it would take us to--
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Yeah.  If.  Whatever.  What kind you figure it is?
Oh, Jesus!
Yeah!  Yeah!
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
I can't hear him.
What's this?  Why did you change it?
What?
If I take something, you suffer. If I don't, I stuff....
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Are you all right?
They don't know.
Then why are they holding us here? Why don't they destroy us right away?  Economically, it's not sound at all.  Very much unlike....
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
We're leaving.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until...
Out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
We had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  She felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... You're upsetting yourself.  Would you like something?
Oh, That!  I'm 5555 SRT Entron..
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
You don't know that!
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
Yes...
Go ahead.
Alright, let's check it out.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
You mentioned something called Redstone.
Which one's which?
It's working.
No, I'd slip out past the hotel district, behind Greyhound...
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Good, now the other side.
More metal... sharp edge...
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
What do you think?
Right.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
C4, plastic explosive.
Thank you.
Alex, please.
He is!
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Fuckin A, I think I got two partial prints here!
Oh shit...
Next week we work the park.
One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
What was it this time?
It don't work-
Nice to be here.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
still studying the vase. Mariette appears. He turns to her.
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
The representative of the police wants to know how much money you had, M'sieu Filiba.
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
Yes!
Let me tell you, Venice <u>can't</u> <u>compare</u> with Constantinople.
Nice day, Major.
Like it?
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
Yes, Baron?
Um-hum ...
Um-hum!
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
But not now.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
Now just a minute, Major--
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Naturally I did.
What's wrong now?
Too much blue in crimson.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
What shade of powder do you use?
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Right!
Beautiful specimen.
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
The same thing.
Then lunch in the Bois--
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've <u>got</u> to stay. You can't go now!
I'm crazy about you!
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Adolph J. Giron.
Giron...!
Divine ...
But it could have been glorious.
Lovely.
Yes, Madame Colet?
About what?
Well--uh--yes and no.
To me he seems rather nervous.
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
No--I'm sorry.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
You're certain?
So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?  That's great!
This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs...?
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
I was tired.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
But I was with him the whole time.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
You're a good liar.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Mr. Dawson, I --
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
If only it were that simple.
It is that simple.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
Jack, must you go?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Now it's worse.
I promise.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
It's been 84 years...
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Anya, I think you're crazy.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
I'll join you later.
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Baloney!
Montana?
You'll excuse me. 
Will you pardon me?
Stick-up. Needed dough to get ashore.
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Yes--are you?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
How about giving me another coat?
Good-by!
Tell me.
Don't be a c-a-t.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Sorry.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
Yes--is it all right if I come like this? 
I could see you were pining away--
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Lose?--I won a little--
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Are you screwy?
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
Thank you, sir. 
What is it?
It's your deal.
I thought you were a sucker--
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up--  How about a nightcap, Inspector?
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
Nice girl, that--  I'd hate to see <U>her</U> get a raw deal.  You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're <U>too</U> smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you-- 
Where do you live?
How?
Hello, Denby!
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Are you happy?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all <U>Nice</U> people--
Meaning what?
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Chad--Lother's on the boat, and I'm worried sick about Sally--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
What for?
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
He's all right.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
No!
Thank you.
Telegrams.
Then why did you run away?
Gave all that up.  Going into business.
I don't understand.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Excuse me?
On three?  You call it.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave.  Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
But Doc-
All right, Doc...
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt.  Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's.  Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life.  There's Only life, that's all.  Just life. The rest is relative.
Then what do I do?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
What is it?
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Where do you get these questions?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
You mean Behan?  Then why are you with him?
The way you talk.  Never heard a Woman talk like that.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
Mattie.  What about this?
'Least they don't scare women.
McMasters, isn't it?  Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
We should get moving.
Look pretty rough.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
You'll never make that stick.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.
Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives.
Briefly.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting?
Actually, I've never known you to do either... But -
... 17 Beverage cup holders?
Wait a minute -
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
Paris -
Perhaps. But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people.  If you believe what you read in the papers.
What do you want with the Harbor Master?
I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife.
They'd never sail this close to the shore.
Where to now, Jimbo?
... Does this do anything?
Insurance. Lloyds of London.
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
- You're not.
What the hell does that do?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
Another reason??? Did I miss something???
First, that boat is in international waters. I'm claiming it for salvage. One-third of that gold is mine.
And number two?
Which is also why I've withheld this information from NATO and our allies.
Sorry I'm late -
The infrared satellite images. No heat, no flame, no explosion. If that boat went down where they said it did, there should have been some residual heat reading on the surface.
Stop it!
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
- I told you! He was there! -
Take the men. I can finish alone.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
Like muddy waters?
It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like.
I couldn't believe the things I was doing. It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
What for?
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
Never play with someone's else's cards. You always get a new deck. Look at this card. See anything?
Let us settle this tomorrow.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
You should go back and rest.
How is everybody?
You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched. Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree?
How many people do you all feed?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
I don't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
You know Harry lied about how that boy Hocker got kilt. And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.
Now you don't have to say anything if you don't want to.
Whadda ya think?
Well, honey, just grab some other toy!  Now c'mon!
What?  What is it?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?
We're almost there.
Say, isn't that mistletoe?
Hello-o-o...
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
Toy?
Listen, Lightsnack, you stay away from Andy.  He's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
That's why.  Sid.
Down there.  Just down there.  A helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, Buzz!
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!
I sure hope this isn't permanent.
What happened to you?
Sh-h-h-h-h!!  Quiet, Buzz.
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I...Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.
Oh, Buzz, you've had a big fall. You must not be thinking clearly.
No, it is.  Look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a Space Ranger, pal, it's because you're a TOY!  You are HIS toy.
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Hold on, Woody!
Great!
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
It's not a laser!  It's a little lightbulb that blinks!
Something's screwy here.
Hey!!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
Hey look!  It's Buzz!
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
I can manage.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Is that all?
Who's there?
The swan was so ridiculous. All the same, it did scare me.
So had I.
We're too young.
I can't find Manolo.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere.  I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
That was a stupid thing you did. Incredibly stupid.
So Arnie, when were you going to tell me about the 3 million dollars we got in from San Francisco two days after I got arrested?
Carl --
To begin with, she's only sixteen years-old.
How long have you known?
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Just watching you.
Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind --
What do you think she wants?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
Your friends at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.
You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff.  Three categories: you like me, you hate me, you want something from me.  Definitely third category.
I'll put this in the back.
You may speak.
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Yes, sir!
I hear these stories.  Your husband in jail.  His business in chaos. Various people fighting over the scraps.
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine.  Odorless. Undetectable by dogs.  Undetectable by anyone.
You first.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Who?
Yeah.  It should be fun.  You wanna come?
Somewhere safe.
We agree.
Javier Rodriguez.
An informant.
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
I'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel.
What is it you want me to do?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The worst serial killer in history - who?  Gacy - right?  Killed forty two people.  Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day.
I'm looking for my daughter, Caroline. She comes here.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
Oh, man --
I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process.  Not only physical, but also psychological.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
Who do we interface with on their side?
What kind of research?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
Shut you mouth or you'll be next.
Yes, you fucking do. I've seen your statement.
This was his nightmare. The dodgiest scam in a lifetime of dodgie scams being perpetrated with three of the most useless and unreliable fuck-ups in town. I knew what was going on in his mind: any trouble in London and he would dump us immediately, one way or another. He had to. If he got caught with a bagful of skag, on top of that armed robbery shit, he was going down for fifteen to twenty. Begbie was hard, but not so hard that he didn't shite it off twenty years in Saughton.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
What?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Are you clean?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
It's Iggy Pop.
So why have you told me about it?
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Sixteen next month.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
Tommy knew he had the virus, like, but never knew he'd gone full-blown.
Yes, I want to watch ourselves while we're screwing.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
Oh, really?
You take the test?
Screenwriter?
Well, at one time, you've got it, and then you lose it, and it's gone for ever. All walks of life: George Best, for example, had it and lost it, or David Bowie, or Lou Reed -
What about The Untouchables?
I don't rate that at all.
Do you see the beast? Have you got it in you sights?
God, you're sick.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Why?
How much?
So he met me and I offered to take it off his hands at a very reasonable price, with the intention of punting it on myself to a guy I know in London.
Four Grand.
That's tough.
Well, it's up to you.
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
Your usual table, sir?
Sure.
Yeah.
It will be. It'll make a change for three miserable junkies who don't know what they want to do with themselves since they stopped doing smack.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Mr. Chekov, I've lost the Bird of Prey. She must have cloaked.
You caught me on my way to the shower.
On "The Planet Of Galactic Peace?"
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Join my quest.
Scotty here, Captain. Transporter is still inoperative. Even if we could lock onto the hostages, we couldn't beam them up.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
That song did not come up in my research, Captain.
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
Exactly. That is correct. Sybok's mother was a Vulcan princess. Upon her death, Sybok and I were raised as brothers.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
But the center of the galaxy can't be reached. No ship has ever gone into the Great Barrier. No probe has ever returned.
Spock.
...mark two.
Spock... don't.
What is this?
No! No reply. Remain on course.
But if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
Given to me by God.  He waits for us on the other side.



You did break in.
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Alan-One. He calls me... may I pass?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Flynn! Look, Tron, he survived!
Okay ... Flynn, I'm gonna put you at my terminal, down in the laser lab. We'll be up in Alan's office.
I hope you've enjoyed being a command program, Sark. I wonder how you'll like working in a pocket calculator... maybe one of those watches that plays "Happy Birthday" to its User once a year.
Now, sir... We did take care of that User you sent us --
Do you know what he's talking about?
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
You bitch.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Where are you off to young lady?
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
Immediate roll.  Acquire subject at K Street and Key Bridge.					* Vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  You have six minutes.
Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you copy?
Kids.  Ten seconds of joy. Thirty years of misery.
See, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. You probably think she's still a virgin--
Son of a bitch!
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
You want me to just hang-- ?
Just hang a minute.
He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen. It's Helen, Gib.
Congratulations.  Welcome to the club.
Aw, it's gotta be a typo--
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
She's lying.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
He's got it.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
Did you tell her about us, Harry?
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.
They must've just missed me.
I thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
Yes.
Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--
What do you think?  Of course yes!  What's involved?
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
Are we going to die?
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Sorry.  Trade secret.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
Beat it.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
I understand.
I know.  But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
Three of them.  Hardly worth					* talking about.  Two won't bother				* me again.
What is it you need me to do?
Helen, there's a double agent in my outfit... I don't know who. There's no one I can trust. Except you.  Can you get away? Just for two days.
I don't know.  I have to think...
Helen.
His wife.
You got that playing basketball?
Thanks a lot.
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
There's nothing to tell.
Burt Reynolds.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
A real live pimp?
Is he nice?
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
What?
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy?
So you do eat pussy!
Naw naw!
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
Clarence?
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
What's this acting class guy's name?
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
What do you think, eightball?
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
You were a cop.
No shit?
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.  Want a Chesterfield?
No.
Come again?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
McTeague.
Could we try it now?
But a fuckin' baggie.
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
Or a supporting actor -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny.  There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit -
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this!  Kandi, you gotta help me.
Do you live here?
Do you know where we can find him?
Where's that?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
And your only goal is...???
"James"!  Nobody ever calls me that.
You wouldn't understand.
You're afraid of germs?
What year is it?
What year do you think it is?
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Are you hurt?
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
What's the matter with your leg?
What have you done?  Did you...kill someone?
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
You do know me.  You helped me once.
JOSE!
You have him in restraints.
Yes, please.  You said he gave a name...
No, thank you.
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I said I was sorry.
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
I can see just fine.  For example: You're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.
Maybe I do.
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark.  People are afraid of what they can't see.  I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. Kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  The kiss of death. It's all the same.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Can I help you, sir?
Please, you don't understand.  I have to get out of here.  They're going to come looking for me. They're going to kill me.  If I can't get this ticket then I'm going to have to do things to get out of here.  I don't want to hurt anybody, I just want to leave.
Will he be back soon?
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Yep.  For the hose.  But while you was gone I replaced a gasket. That's going to run you another fifty.
Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  I can't do unauthorized work. I suppose I can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me.
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?
What's it to you?
What would a truck stop be without beer?
We ain't got no Beck's.
Genuine Draft?
Let me get your change.
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
There you go, Mrs. McKenna.  Just put it in there.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
How could I?  I was sleeping.
What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
I'm just going to my car.
I got it.
Accident.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways.  I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
You love him?
I'm guessing no.
All this nothing?  I've spent my life in this stinking desert.  It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me.  He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker.  Big fish in a small pond, he says.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway.  I mean, I would . . . do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said:  You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
Yeah.
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
John?  John where are you going?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
It's got to be here.  I heard him talk about it.  He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
If you want.
Let's go in the bedroom.
Let's do it here.
One-hundred-thousand dollars.  A little more.
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.
Are you all right?
No.  I swear it.
Who the hell are you?
Jake McKenna.  That's a solid name.
Live there?
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Would I what?
No.
Hungry?
No.
Now what can I do for you?
And what does that make you?
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Make it twenty.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Do we shake hands?
What should I do?
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before.  I guess I should have hired a professional.
No.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Yeah, well, me too.
He did more work on the car.  He wants fifty bucks extra for it.
And then with Jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  Or maybe two-thousand.  Or twenty-thousand.  Who's to stop you? Not Jake McKenna, 'cause old Jake would be dead.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
That's a thick change of heart.
That's a lot of talk.  A whole lot of talk.
This morning when I came in on you and Grace, you swore you hadn't so much as been near the bedroom.  Now you make straight for it.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
I've had time to get over it.
You're fucked.
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
No.  He gets shot by the old lady.
Let me get this straight:  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
A hundred-forty-five really.
There was a young man over at Jamilla's today when it got hit. Way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
That's what this is all about?  A shakedown?  You picked the wrong people.  We don't have any money.
I said I was sorry.
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
I'm a little short Pops. I'll catch you next time.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Let's see...they're not very imaginative?
Christ, I don't believe this!
Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy.
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
Say, what happened to your hand?
Accident.
That's a solid name.
I'm a solid man.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Like you don't know.
Would you?
Sweet Grace?  What about her?
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I do.
Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace.
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
You'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
What?
What happened to your hand?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
For what?
Yeah, I can fix it.
Great!
Jesus.  Twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
What the hell happened to my car?
How much!?
One of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
Two-hundred.
I didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
Yeah, but it was shot.
All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change?
No.
Got any cold soda?
I'm just going to my car?
You sure you can manage?
I just drove in this morning.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Nice place.
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
What?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Doesn't the isolation bother you?
You'd never understand.
Is it pretty?
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
I can't see it.
Anywhere?
So, aren't you going to ask me?
Why?
I busted my leg!
And I love you too.
Morning, officer.
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
The old lady?
What'd you say to me!
But, in particular?
What kind?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Honest, Toby.  I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
Where's the fire sweetheart? Don't know how they work things in Nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Oh shit...
Soft and Wet. That's very interesting.
I'm not sure.
Seventy-five percent.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?
What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?
It's an exaggeration of the truth. Maybe it's based on something as simple as instinct. Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they've done something wrong... Or the level of what they've done wrong.
Quick.
I see.
I'll just shoot him once.
Not really.
Where is it?
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
If they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
He's coming ain't he?
We never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
You're a beautiful woman an'... if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't... See... I can't have no free one on account of my wife...
Been a long time, Bob. You run out of Chinamen?
Books. He's my biographer.
Mmmm pistols.
We got one of them fuckers, Sheriff, out by Cow Creek, we...
Property.
All week?
That much, huh?
Well, I guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
Uh... yeah. Yeah.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
I was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
He's... he's dead.
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
About what?
For cuttin' up a lady. They cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Get some sleep, Kid.
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
They takin' water?
Tell me right off if you see him.
First one what?
Yeah?
Wha... what f-for?
He musta been movin' right along.
Well, she...
He hit you?
HEY.
Why would the Kid shoot at us?
I give it up 'cause I hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  Shit, I sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
Worms was comin' out.
I seen the angel of death Ned, an' I seen the river.  He's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
I'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. Right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
Tom?
Yeah?
Fuck you.
Move the candle closer, I can't see.
All of it. About him, an' you an' Uncle Pete... about robbin' the Rock Island Pacific... an' about them Missouri Banks.
Well, suppose he does?
Yeah?
Yeah.
I don't get it.
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Umm ...
I'd say you've gotten on his main and central nerve, McManus.
It was the Feds. A truck load of guns gets snagged, Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D. for some answers - they come up with us. They're grabbing at straws. It's politics - nothing you can do.
How do I know that? How about it, pretzel-man? What's your story?
I know you. You don't think I know you're on the take. This whole fucking precinct is dirty. You don't have a fucking leg to stand on.
How do you do?
I did you a favor by standing up for you last night, but don't think we're friends. I'm sorry, but I have other things -
Get out.
Don't hurt me.
Fenster and Hockney?
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
Three million?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Keaton, I can't just -
What did you say?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.
He wants to meet you. He called last night and asked me to set it up. What do I tell him'
Someplace else, then.
I know he was good.
According to your statement you are a short-con operator. Run of the mill seams. Everything you do, you learned from somebody else.
Well I do have the weapons charge. I'm looking at six whole months hard time.
There's nothing in there about Ruby.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
A man in a suit with a slim build. Tall.
Verbal, he left you behind for a reason. If you all knew Soze could find you anywhere, why was he ready to send you off with the money when he could have used you to take the boat?
He wanted me to live.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
You think he's..?
Abrams...
What did he find?
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.
Anything special about the case?
Thank you.  When Debby...
Dr. Towler, who was in the operating room with you?
You reached down into death.  Now, isn't that right?
Just as you are, Sir...
Neurology?
Orthopedics?
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
Why is that?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
Dr. Thompson...?
Yes.  Yes.  I think so.  I hope you'll be comfortable.  I'm putting you up at my...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anaesthetic.  Ideally a  patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anaesthetic.'  Does that sound familiar?
I read the hospital report on your client.
The hospital is owned by the Archdioceses of ...
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth.  He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life.  And we can prove that.  What we don't know is why.  What went on in there?  In the O.R.  That's what we'd like to know.  Something went wrong.  And you know what it was.  They gave her the wrong anesthetic.  What happened?  The phone rang...someone got distracted...what?
Why is that?
That happens.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out...They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case.  Now this is it today.
Are you done?
Damn right I'm done.  I'm going to ask for a mistrial and I'm going to request that you disqualify yourself from sitting on this case. I'm going to take a transcript to the State and ask that they impeach your ass.
Overruled...
I can't guarantee that...
Mr. Galvin's...
Missus...
Yes, we know that you do.  I have it in my files.  That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Laura.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
You're going to stay here...?
Isn't there something you...
And it's over...?
Yes.
Not if you don't grow up...
If I don't 'grow up...'
Is it over?
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
I have to talk to you.
What do you want?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
...he's a good man...
We've got her sister.  Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point.
No.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
I can't talk now.
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
The broad has disappeared...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
... You saw her?
You know how beautiful she was?   Her husband left her, and he took her kids .... They, they, they'd let you die in there.  They don't care.  Nobody cares.  The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care ... in Arlington ...?  They'd take her in.  Perpetual care.  They'd take her.  Fifty thousand dollars they want.  An endowment.
I don't want to leave her.  Dick ...the, the ... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will ...
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
I want to buy you a drink.
Yeah.
It's a long road that has no turning.
Brain damage could have been...it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
Yes.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
And you like it.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, I'm all right.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
He had no right to say that. It was my responsibility. You didn't know her. I shouldn't have got you involved.
I -- I --
Hello.
What happened?
Judy Barton.
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
Mmmm.
I've got it.  He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
We're going awfully far.
No!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Some money.
Love me... keep me safe...
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
Wander about.
One shouldn't live alone.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Do you hear anything?
The tall trees...
Why did you jump?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
What do you remember?
Where?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
What else?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
Don't leave me... stay with me...
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Let me go! Let me go!!
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Well?
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
Easy, now.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Do you know him well?
The poor thing....
Out. I've got things to do.
Is she pretty?
Carlotta?
Did you need it?
Oh... this and that.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
They'll get us on accesory to murder.
I'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore.
What?
You're an asshole Adam.
You're an asshole.
This is pathetic.
What did you say?
The hell you do.
Go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
She's got no fucking pulse.
What?
Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay... First...are we sure she's dead?
We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom. What options? Call the police.
Bury her out in the desert.
Her fucking head was caved in.
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
According to Jewish law, the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being. They must be buried together or their souls won't rest in peace.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
What?
The bucks gonna stop right here.  If my son doesn't know the six New England states, if he has trouble with geography, I won't stick it in his face. I'll help the little guy. I'll put him in the car and take him out there. I'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee Stadium...I won't stare him down.
No way.
Where is she?
But not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?
He just had two.
That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars.
Nobody knows she's here.
That is a load of shit. Personal power has nothing to do with any of this. Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly, yes, but to give him credit for this, for all of this...Well that's just more than the man deserves.
I think we should say some words over the grave.
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
Isn't it a little late?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
I'm talking about some bad, bad, very bad things. Bad things! Those are bad fucking things!
Not a prayer.
The hell you didn't!
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
Then what do they have?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
What? What's your point?
They need leadership.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
Easy Micheal.
Come on tough guy. Listen to me.  You are going to tell Lois that it was all an accident. Okay cowboy? You got me?
This is ridiculous.
Government cutbacks.
Sent it.
Why?
Who else?
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
So what do we do?
I will.
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
That's sweet.
Well you should.
Yeah. Nesting.
What's the word on the chairs?
No way.
What kind of stupid question is that?
Stop! You stop right here. I don't want to know anymore. I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing. You were warned.
He kept saying he was protected.
Like how?
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Everything okay?
I just want her to be happy.
Do you hear buzzing Fish?
Buzzing?
The wahoo?
I guess.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.
Good times.
Lots. It's got balconies and two big towers.
Enedina and Paco ...
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
If you like, I will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
You're lying.
I'd be really ungrateful, if I didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when I didn't know where to turn.
She won't even know.
They told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
It's very good.
So, Ramona!
Shouldn't I be? You, on the other hand ...
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
Miss Viridiana ...
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Is that all you're going to devote your life to?
And ...your friend?
Then let him go and he'll follow you.
A black bull came.
Yes -- very, very big!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
Ask the priest, miss.
From the terrace.
You son-ofabitch, I'm going to kill you.
My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
You all right?
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
Watching your VR people Auto Reset gave me the idea.
How do you kill it?
I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks, he has absolutely no idea he's in virtual reality. He still thinks he's in the real world.
Which God would that be, the one who created me, or the one who created you?  In your world, the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. But in my world, the one who gave me life doesn't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away.
You catching my drift?
Every day for the last five years, I told myself someday I would be out here again. No more bars. No more guards. No more fights just to stay alive.  Every day for the last five years, I told myself that lie.
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual reality?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
I forgot what real coffee tastes like...
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
If we find Sid, Lindenmeyer won't be far behind.
Find out anything?
You don't know?
You...mother...fucker! I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!!!
Aren't you going to watch with me?
What are you talking about?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old friend?
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
What if he's busy tonight?
It's the White House.
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....

Three-o-three...
President's speech.
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
I saw it on TV.
Oh, he's gonna be Aces.
What?
Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?
Yes, but there wasn't a War.
Hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...
Big mistake.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Just....do what I ...look:  get me a ...hello...? Hel...?  I'm going to need an <u>ambulance</u>, we take him, the last moment, right from the Pl...no, <u>we</u> land, we puttem <u>in</u> the ambulance.  Air force jet lands, we take somebody <u>else</u> off <u>that</u> jet...what the fuck do <u>I</u> care? Somebody in a Hospital gown.  And we need a ......hello?  Hello...?
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
You would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
They'll be here in ten minutes.
I go with this here... 
I have the White House on the Line.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
We-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
What the fuck did you <u>mean</u>, "What kind of stuff?"?
...just want to Get Back to the Beans...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
Is it a <u>stream</u>, or is it a...
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
If I'm closing out this account. If he doesn't pay for it tomorrow, you pay for it.
...if I had your looks, better.
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
...gotta read my reports.
Got a little action there, eh buddy?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
Sure...lots of guys at the track talk like that... but how do you know you'll have any dough next month...  What's this? I gave you two hundred.
Don't worry about the loans. I'm doing good Dad and it's gonna stay that way now... least buy yourself a new suit.
...thanks Natalie.
So, where are we going?
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
Yeah, check out Teldar Paper, it's still not over.
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
A comer. 80 medium-body jets. 300 pilots, flies northeast, Canada, some Florida and Caribbean routes... great slots in major cities...
Know the name?
My firm needs your signature on these option agreements tonight, sir, otherwise we could take a real bath tomorrow.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Gordon.
Excuse me.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the  houseplant.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
Do you think you're ready?
Any better and I'd be guilty.
Frankly, Carl, I can't see giving much more. If you have any suggestions I'll be glad to listen.
Fine, if you don't want us, stay with the scum in present management--dedicated to running you and Bluestar into the ground.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
Come on, we both like Buddy. But this bleeding heart puppy love act is over the top... It doesn't fit.
Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Yeah well why should I suffer for that?
Oh Mark.  It's ok.  It's ok.
Weird and tiny huh?
Thank you Jenkins
We're all here, and ready sir!
She went to a waxwork party
Then why do you still like her?
Come on.
You aren't sick! We've got to get back.  What are you doing!
Well?
Anyone else not coming?
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
You get yourself a regular job, as Satan's disciple.
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
You bet.  We all can't be such modern people 
I know that.
I'll come back all the time.
What?
Are you humoring me?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
There was just...some tension.  You were upset.  I remember being concerned.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Um...
She isn't here.
I don't know.
You're the flower lady.
How?  How can you help me?  With your flowers and your perfect life...
I've never even met you.
Your house is so beautiful.
Sounds about right.  Never understood how a girl that wild got all A's.  Sure didn't get it from me.  They wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  Maddie wouldn't hear about it.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
You should have heard her play.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
Absolutely.
I was down in Adamant...
We need help.  Please let me call the medium.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
Whatcha reading?
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Ohmigod.  You'll never believe...I saw Schumway...
Well, that's nice.
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
I'm so sorry.
What?
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
I didn't do that.
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
You're not at the center.
Norman...
Maybe you resent how busy I've been.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
The accident...?
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
It's Madison Fra--
I think she's starting to suspect something.
"You know..."
I was there.
So you fucked a student?!
Stop...
We have to get out of here.
Do you know it?
What's that for?
Don't I, Norman?  YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE.  Of a woman you killed!
Mmmuh...
:Well, they are.
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
Michael, Rowan should -
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
Rowan Mayfair.  Who's calling...?
A very tired one.  I've been up all night - and I would .like to rest before the funeral.     Have your lawyer -
I might as well be Rowan Smith - or Jones!   you cut me off from every -
Witches. Rowan.  that is what we are.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie...?
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
What is wrong...?
Put - him - down!  His - his heart...
Harder...
What do you see...?
HARDER!
Why don't you let at do that...?
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing...?  We don't even know -
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Even if it's all true - that doesn't make you a witch! It's 1992, Rowan!
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---
Michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
What were you talking about...?
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
That's right...
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Do you take sugar?
So what do you do?
And how many people have you killed?
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
How long have you been watching me?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What's wrong?
LESLIE?  Is that good enough?
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
I'm here about the so called disappearance of your husband - It's best if we let old bones lie. Know what I mean?  I'm working on the WHITE ANGEL case now - and I've got to check all known murderers or suspected murderers for the last five years... And that means you...So where were you last THURSDAY afternoon around five...
At home alone - where were you?
I shouldn't really - I'm not your surgeon...
Check this out.  Hurry!
What is it now?
Take a whiff of heaven.
Never say never.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Ladies first.  I insist.
And I was wondering.
Great jacket, Teddy Bear.
Well?
You expect me to think at a time like this? There isn't a drop of blood in my brain.
God, you are so hot.
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I'm Ted, by the way. I think I forgot to say that.
What do you want me to do?
Well?
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
Can you believe that was me?
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
I understand.
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
He was my Grandfather, too.
I have to admit, I always felt... different.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
Is this an gritty expos or a candy ass press release?
Life must be peachy on Planet Ted.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Your dad taught you everything.
I mean my father.
It's all so complicated.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
I don't know. This place seems pretty tame.
I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that.
What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day?
Thanks, Principal Merkin.
Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Uh, sure. Uncle Billy.
There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right?
Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression.
Yes?
I'm terrible at this. I blurt. I'm a blurter. Your parents...They ...well...they exist no further.  Skinny-dipping. The Amazon. Piranhas. It wasn't pretty.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
... is accusing me of rape.  Jimmy told me.  Apparently I'm the last to know...
About Suzie?
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Then what?
Did you call anyone?  Did you call her house to see if she got home?  Did you call the Masons?
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Eliminate the competition.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
The blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.
Yeah, maybe, a little.
Yeah.
So you were alone.
Why?
I said he did.
He was my friend at first.  Then I got busted... he didn't even stick up for me.  I had to go away to that hellhole. It's like, you're his favorite, then who cares?  You wanna know something?  When Kelly said we should do this, I thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.  Now they're gonna get screwed.
A ride.  You want one?
I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're out of your mind.
Am I right, did Sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking Suzie? That's murder, Kelly.
Hi, Mon.
Don't forget the car wash.
Aren't  you forgetting something?  Your coupon.  We gotta have it.
Good thinking.
Forget it.
Can't you take that stupid thing off?
And she wanted to talk.
I'll bet.  Look, Sam.  Why don't you come by this weekend.  We'll take the boat out...
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
Artemus Gordon.  Bach, he's the composer.
You're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  But nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
A giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  Or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
Sorry.  Didn't mean that.  Just a little device of mine...
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
Limestone quarry?
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Uh... how long ago was this?
Thank you.
Sure.  It's a wind-up... thing.
Willard...
Are those just button buttons or...?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
Would that include me?
My.  It's gotten longer.
Don't try to bamboozle me, Colonel. Has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
Nicely said, sir.
Goddamnit!  What am I doing?  What's happened to all my cigars?  Colonel Richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  No arrests, no leads, no clues...
Where'd he say he was going to do this?
No, sir... just a businessman.
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
That would be... the Mexican War?
Because I am holding all the western territories hostage, Mr. West!  A town a day will disappear!  Willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  Next, I level all of Albuquerque!  Yes, that's right.  Only yesterday I learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own President will be there.  What an added bonus! The gods are shining on me!  After tomorrow every American citizen will rise up and demand I be given back my humble little empire!
They look like acorns.
Sir!  I have to talk to you.
I do what I'm told.
Why did you say that?
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Hey!  Somebody's coming!
You gotta promise to feed her.
That's all I ever wanted!
Ouch!!
His will.
Why?
Time is running out.
Patience, Willow.
Madmartigan.
She's hungry.
Queen Cherlindrea?
We've traveled a long way.  We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
I thought I was the English.
No pistol. Ever.
Hey, Sam...
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Maybe.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
They kid a lot.
But why would they murder...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Anything against zippers?
I'm going this morning.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws 
I will be the judge of that.
We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be different.  Our Lancaster brethren, they just don't have that kind of fight in them.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
If any!
If you were really great and powerful, you'd keep your promises!
I don't believe you!
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
Ahh!  Ah!
Oh, very good, but very mysterious.  He lives in the Emerald City, and that's a long journey from here. Did you bring your broomstick with you?
But, how do I start for Emerald City?
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?
Oh --
That's our farm!
...paper?
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have...
...m...m...my, my, my, my goodness -- I can talk again! Oh -- oil my arms, please -- oil my elbows.
My...my neck.  My...my neck.  Perfect?  Oh -- bang on my chest if you think I'm perfect.  Go ahead -- bang on it!
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh - I'll get it!
Oh --
Lions and tigers and bears!
Oh, my!
It's bad enough picking on a straw man, but when you go around picking on poor little dogs --
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Because I'm still scared!
They're coming back!
Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's all.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
Ohhhh --
Oh -- does it hurt you?
Did I scare you?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Dorothy next!
I -- Oh --
Fine.  He's got a plan
Not even a rhinoceros?
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Wait a minute. This is the left one. He walks bad enough already.
Where do we go now?
You don't get around us that easy!
...Tin Man!
That's right.
Animals that -- that eat straw?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
Makes her look even more innocent.
Who told you to look at Elektras files?
He survived?
That which does not kill me makes me stronger.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasnt completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
Its I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair.
He was my father.
No!  It will cave in!
Whats wrong with you?  Are you crazy?
...what?
You can drop the act, its over.
Valentin Zukovsky.
You, of course. I need some information.
Now...where were we?
What is this place?
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Someone will come.
So beautiful. So smooth, so warm.
I can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
No idea who's behind this?
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
Walter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In your mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?
This whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?
Because --
You have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.
He's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at this late date.
Who?
She's with me.
Damn straight.
Well, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the world and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .
That's the one.  Whatever happened to him?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
His what?
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
It's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.
They're following us.
Yes you are.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
I think he's going to the john.
I beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.
What was he doing?
I'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna head straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.
-- What?
Sit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file are all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else in common as well.  They've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.
You're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move it.
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
I know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's doing his work --
Edgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Ever see one of these before?
Gila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
I plan on getting a lot older. And playing spy games sounds like a quick way to get yourself dead.
There's some folks I want to keep tabs on. Dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. Your kind of people.
Silent Night is the name of a top secret binary nerve agent. The glass canister is shot into the air and detonated. The black and white chemicals mix, forming a toxic cloud. When it settles down to Earth, it'll kill everything in the vicinity.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys
The scum of the Earth.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.
Like what?
We hung out last night, remember?
Go to hell!
You agree with a lot of what he says, don't you.
The people I know want facts, the kinds of things an insider would know. They're interested in putting Anarchy 99 out of business.
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that?
No, I guess I've been no help at all to you.
A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine.
Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside.
When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation.
You can't talk to it?
It has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?
By then it's too late! The only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! The chemicals will break down and dissipate!
I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared.
Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s.
Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation...
What...?
You're serious?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out?
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere?
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
Storm.  Try to look for the highest vantage point. From what I can figure, he'll need to gain as much altitude as possible to blanket the island.  It is my feeling that Magneto has to--
Scott.. I -
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
You know, you --
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Come with me and I'll let her live.
The point of what?
How?
I'll find him.
And I'll never understand terrorists.
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed...
Frederick Frankenstein?
What was your grandfather's name?
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Yes, sir.
Is it that music?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
MMmmm.
Love me oodles and oodles?
Well... yes.
Surprised?
Ready, darling?
Is it worth taking a chance?
This is the only library I know of.
